I'm precisely working on separating things on script and I think I'm close to find something that's ready for a PR, but so far I've been doing incremental little improvements first like #4617 #4680 #4681 #4555 #4694 and #4695 \nRight now it's pretty dirty with ugly commits and half-backed ideas, but you can get a general sense of where I'm headed here: https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/tree/script2\nI'll clean it up soon, I just wasn't ready for a PR yet.\n\nI'm making some things templated so that:\n1) The interpreter file is completely independent from core.h\n2) Maybe some people want to use the scripting language to sign other things beside bitcoin transactions?\nIn particular I would like very few things in the same file as the interpreter (in my case checksig the sig cache, and verifyscript) to make it easier to read.\n\nSo I'm not sure what I should do now...we should definitely coordinate.\nMy approach was improving script first, separating it later, then move to its own module (this PR).\nMaybe its own module first then imrpoving things like you're doing it's better.\n",

Among other things, it’s confusing to read and means that they can’t both be used at the same time (for ex, a test to compare their results).\n\nIt also means that the convenience lib can’t be used by the share libs, so several objects have to be built twice to cope.\n\nCan this not be handled with a delegate function or extra param (cache flag or function pointer) to VerifyScript?\n",

I could #ifdef that part out, if y'all prefer, but I want to atleast get script things properly separated and then separate out the other crap later as possible.\n\n@sipa: In the future, I'd hope that bitcoind just uses libbitcoinscript as a static link, so it makes sense to include the exposed file. I agree that the cache flag (and others in the future) dont make any sense to expose (hell, cache isnt even built in...), so I moved that one to script.h.\n\n@petertodd I agree, do you have any ideas for names that arent ridiculously long?\n",

We've never installed headers, so that's not a one-line fix.\n\nI spent a good chunk of the day working on getting exports working properly. It was simple for Linux, but it's going to be quite complicated for windows/osx. We have no infrastructure for building shared libs there, so it's going to require a re-working of dependencies and build-scripts to get non-Linux platforms in place.\n\nOSX dylib builds, but it needed -lcrypto to link. key.cpp and script.h pull in some symbols. I'm not sure why Linux works, presumably the linker is smart enough to drop the unused paths. Windows needs a bunch of work.\n\nSo, NACK on anything but code movement until the aspects of building/distributing shared libs have been properly evaluated. I'm certainly volunteering to help get those things in order, but I don't like the idea of treating master as a feature branch.\n",

Things which are used only by Bitcoin Core\nwill be in scriptutils.{h,cpp}.",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.

We'll have to rewrite a good chunk of configure to quit assuming static linkage for mingw. After those are done, we can teach our headers how to cope with the 2 types of builds. Then we'll need some tests to verify that the dll actually does something useful.\n\nI have all of the above hacked together enough to test. They're non-trivial changes. In reality, I think time would be better spent trying to drop those dependencies for lib usage, since they're quite minimal already.\n",
