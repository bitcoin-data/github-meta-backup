(Which isn't much effort, but can be annoying to forget)",

      "body": "> If a power outage causes corruptions, you probably have bigger problems with your setup.\r\n\r\nSolutions like RapiBlitz, Umbrel or MyNode make setting up a node really easy. These are cheap and easy to build nodes, but Raspberry Pis don't deal with power outages well, and that can often lead to data corruption. A power outage causing problems is in my opinion okay for personal nodes, many users just want to get their node set up without having to worry about (and pay for) an UPS or something similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n> My point is: if you automatically reindex, the user isn't made aware of the corruption, can't do anything to resolve whatever is causing it, and the next time it gets corrupted you'll just start all over again.\r\n\r\nShould I add a warning to the logs about it then? A sudden power outage is the most likely cause, and if something can be fixed, why not fix it automatically? A delay will be noticed by the user (and a warning), like when Bitcoin is \"Rolling forward\", which is also triggered by an unclean shutdown.",
