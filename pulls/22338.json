The comment in the test has been updated to accurately reflect what is going on.</s>\r\n\r\nBased on Aj's comment, I have changed the PR so that it renames the constants/functions that operate on PreTapScript Scripts. \r\n\r\nI don't know if this is the ideal way to separate pre-tapscripts and tapscripts.  If the new PR is not useful, feel free to close it. ",

      "body": "> This change is not really necessary as MAX_OPCODE check is only really\r\nused while decoding transactions\r\n\r\nTo elaborate, right now this is used while parsing scrpitPubkey and ScrpitSig in a Tx. It is impossible for `CHECKSIGADD` to end up in `scriptSig` or `scriptPubkey` in taproot. Secondly, the opcode execution is only valid for taproot scripts, but according to the current design, the functions checking validity of scripts don't have access to appropriate scriptContext.\r\n\r\nSo, the ideal solution would be to somehow pass the script context and enforce that the `CHECKSIGADD` is only used in tapscripts, but that probably requires more discussion and is out of scope for this PR.",

      "body": "Concept ACK\r\n\r\n> So, the ideal solution would be to somehow pass the script context and enforce that the CHECKSIGADD is only used in tapscripts, but that probably requires more discussion and is out of scope for this PR.\r\n\r\nThe main thing to review here is then that this doesn't create any risk for non-tapscript verification. It seems that `MAX_OPCODE` is used in:\r\n- `ParseOpCode` parsing from text (non-consensus critical)\r\n- `CScript::HasValidOps()` (used only in `CheckTxScriptsSanity`, in `core_read`, and tests/fuzz, so non-consensus-critical)\r\n- `ConsumeOpcodeType` in the fuzz tests (non-consensus critical)\r\n\r\nI don't think this should even be labeled \"consensus\"? Or am I missing something.\r\n\r\nCode review ACK 90f6a623b394e65a34a1918ec67420c899c52bf4",
