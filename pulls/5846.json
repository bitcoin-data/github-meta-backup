Sample failure here: https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/52724160\n\nI believe I've been able to reproduce locally, and these changes fixed the issue I was experiencing.\n- don't use -connect=0.0.0.0. This actually causes attempted connections to 0.0.0.0.\n- Don't attempt to discover our IP. That's not needed here.\n- With those two removed, the timings are changed such that the previous watchdog didn't always work. Use proper tail/grep semantics to ensure that grep always exits quickly.\n\nBefore these changes, I was able to locally reproduce a test failure ~10% of the time. After, I'm unable to see a failure.\n",

Use proper tail/grep semantics to ensure that\n  grep always exits quickly.\n\nBefore these changes, I was able to locally reproduce a test failure ~10% of\nthe time.
