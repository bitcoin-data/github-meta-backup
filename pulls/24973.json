      "diff_hunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,378 @@\n+23.0 Release Notes\n+==================\n+\n+Bitcoin Core version 23.0 is now available from:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-23.0/>\n+\n+This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performance\n+improvements, as well as updated translations.\n+\n+Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:\n+\n+  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>\n+\n+To receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/>\n+\n+How to Upgrade\n+==============\n+\n+If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- A bitcoind node will no longer rumour addresses to inbound peers by default.\n+  They will become eligible for address gossip after sending an ADDR, ADDRV2,\n+  or GETADDR message. (#21528)\n+\n+- Before this release, Bitcoin Core had a strong preference to try to connect only to peers that listen on port 8333. As a result of that, Bitcoin nodes listening on non-standard ports would likely not get any Bitcoin Core peers connecting to them. This preference has been removed. (#23542)\n+\n+- Full support has been added for the CJDNS network. See the new option `-cjdnsreachable` and [doc/cjdns.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/23.x/doc/cjdns.md) (#23077)\n+\n+Fee estimation changes\n+----------------------\n+\n+- Fee estimation now takes the feerate of replacement (RBF) transactions into\n+  account. (#22539)\n+\n+Rescan startup parameter removed\n+--------------------------------\n+\n+The `-rescan` startup parameter has been removed. Wallets which require\n+rescanning due to corruption will still be rescanned on startup.\n+Otherwise, please use the `rescanblockchain` RPC to trigger a rescan. (#23123)\n+\n+Tracepoints and Userspace, Statically Defined Tracing support\n+-------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+Bitcoin Core release binaries for Linux now include experimental tracepoints which\n+act as an interface for process-internal events. These can be used for review,\n+debugging, monitoring, and more. The tracepoint API is semi-stable. While the API\n+is tested, process internals might change between releases requiring changes to the\n+tracepoints. Information about the existing tracepoints can be found under\n+[doc/tracing.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/23.x/doc/tracing.md) and\n+usage examples are provided in [contrib/tracing/](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/23.x/contrib/tracing).\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `validateaddress` RPC now returns an `error_locations` array for invalid\n+  addresses, with the indices of invalid character locations in the address (if\n+  known). For example, this will attempt to locate up to two Bech32 errors, and\n+  return their locations if successful. Success and correctness are only guaranteed\n+  if fewer than two substitution errors have been made.\n+  The error message returned in the `error` field now also returns more specific\n+  errors when decoding fails. (#16807)\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=addresses` configuration option has been removed.  RPCs\n+  `gettxout`, `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`, `decodescript`,\n+  `gettransaction verbose=true` and REST endpoints `/rest/tx`, `/rest/getutxos`,\n+  `/rest/block` no longer return the `addresses` and `reqSigs` fields, which\n+  were previously deprecated in 22.0. (#22650)\n+- The `getblock` RPC command now supports verbosity level 3 containing transaction inputs'\n+  `prevout` information.  The existing `/rest/block/` REST endpoint is modified to contain\n+  this information too. Every `vin` field will contain an additional `prevout` subfield\n+  describing the spent output. `prevout` contains the following keys:\n+  - `generated` - true if the spent coins was a coinbase.\n+  - `height`\n+  - `value`\n+  - `scriptPubKey`\n+\n+- The top-level fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees`\n+  returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`,`getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`\n+  are deprecated and will be removed in the next major version (use\n+  `-deprecated=fees` if needed in this version). The same fee fields can be accessed\n+  through the `fees` object in the result. WARNING: deprecated\n+  fields `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are denominated in sats, whereas all\n+  fields in the `fees` object are denominated in BTC. (#22689)\n+\n+- Both `createmultisig` and `addmultisigaddress` now include a `warnings`\n+  field, which will show a warning if a non-legacy address type is requested\n+  when using uncompressed public keys. (#23113)\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- Information on soft fork status has been moved from `getblockchaininfo`\n+  to the new `getdeploymentinfo` RPC which allows querying soft fork status at any\n+  block, rather than just at the chain tip. Inclusion of soft fork\n+  status in `getblockchaininfo` can currently be restored using the\n+  configuration `-deprecatedrpc=softforks`, but this will be removed in\n+  a future release. Note that in either case, the `status` field\n+  now reflects the status of the current block rather than the next\n+  block. (#23508)\n+\n+Files\n+-----\n+\n+* On startup, the list of banned hosts and networks (via `setban` RPC) in\n+  `banlist.dat` is ignored and only `banlist.json` is considered. Bitcoin Core\n+  version 22.x is the only version that can read `banlist.dat` and also write\n+  it to `banlist.json`. If `banlist.json` already exists, version 22.x will not\n+  try to translate the `banlist.dat` into json. After an upgrade, `listbanned`\n+  can be used to double check the parsed entries. (#22570)\n+\n+Updated settings\n+----------------\n+\n+- In previous releases, the meaning of the command line option\n+  `-persistmempool` (without a value provided) incorrectly disabled mempool\n+  persistence.  `-persistmempool` is now treated like other boolean options to\n+  mean `-persistmempool=1`. Passing `-persistmempool=0`, `-persistmempool=1`\n+  and `-nopersistmempool` is unaffected. (#23061)\n+\n+- `-maxuploadtarget` now allows human readable byte units [k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T].\n+  E.g. `-maxuploadtarget=500g`. No whitespace, +- or fractions allowed.\n+  Default is `M` if no suffix provided. (#23249)\n+\n+- If `-proxy=` is given together with `-noonion` then the provided proxy will\n+  not be set as a proxy for reaching the Tor network. So it will not be\n+  possible to open manual connections to the Tor network for example with the\n+  `addnode` RPC. To mimic the old behavior use `-proxy=` together with\n+  `-onlynet=` listing all relevant networks except `onion`. (#22834)\n+\n+Tools and Utilities\n+-------------------\n+\n+- Update `-getinfo` to return data in a user-friendly format that also reduces vertical space. (#21832)\n+\n+- CLI `-addrinfo` now returns a single field for the number of `onion` addresses\n+  known to the node instead of separate `torv2` and `torv3` fields, as support\n+  for Tor V2 addresses was removed from Bitcoin Core in 22.0. (#22544)\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- Descriptor wallets are now the default wallet type. Newly created wallets\n+  will use descriptors unless `descriptors=false` is set during `createwallet`, or\n+  the `Descriptor wallet` checkbox is unchecked in the GUI.\n+\n+  Note that wallet RPC commands like `importmulti` and `dumpprivkey` cannot be\n+  used with descriptor wallets, so if your client code relies on these commands\n+  without specifying `descriptors=false` during wallet creation, you will need\n+  to update your code.\n+\n+- Newly created descriptor wallets will contain an automatically generated `tr()`\n+  descriptor which allows for creating single key Taproot receiving addresses.\n+\n+- `upgradewallet` will now automatically flush the keypool if upgrading\n+  from a non-HD wallet to an HD wallet, to immediately start using the\n+  newly-generated HD keys. (#23093)\n+\n+- a new RPC `newkeypool` has been added, which will flush (entirely\n+  clear and refill) the keypool. (#23093)\n+\n+- `listunspent` now includes `ancestorcount`, `ancestorsize`, and\n+  `ancestorfees` for each transaction output that is still in the mempool.\n+  (#12677)\n+\n+- `lockunspent` now optionally takes a third parameter, `persistent`, which\n+  causes the lock to be written persistently to the wallet database. This\n+  allows UTXOs to remain locked even after node restarts or crashes. (#23065)\n+\n+- `receivedby` RPCs now include coinbase transactions. Previously, the\n+  following wallet RPCs excluded coinbase transactions: `getreceivedbyaddress`,\n+  `getreceivedbylabel`, `listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`. This\n+  release changes this behaviour and returns results accounting for received\n+  coins from coinbase outputs. The previous behaviour can be restored using the\n+  configuration `-deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase`, but may be removed in a\n+  future release. (#14707)\n+\n+- A new option in the same `receivedby` RPCs, `include_immature_coinbase`\n+  (default=`false`), determines whether to account for immature coinbase\n+  transactions. Immature coinbase transactions are coinbase transactions that\n+  have 100 or fewer confirmations, and are not spendable. (#14707)\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- UTXOs which are locked via the GUI are now stored persistently in the\n+  wallet database, so are not lost on node shutdown or crash. (#23065)\n+\n+- The Bech32 checkbox has been replaced with a dropdown for all address types, including the new Bech32m (BIP-350) standard for Taproot enabled wallets.\n+\n+Low-level changes\n+=================\n+\n+RPC\n+---\n+\n+- `getblockchaininfo` now returns a new `time` field, that provides the chain tip time. (#22407)\n+\n+Tests\n+-----\n+\n+- For the `regtest` network the activation heights of several softforks were\n+  set to block height 1. They can be changed by the runtime setting\n+  `-testactivationheight=name@height`.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- A bitcoind node will no longer rumour addresses to inbound peers by default.\n+  They will become eligible for address gossip after sending an ADDR, ADDRV2,\n+  or GETADDR message. (#21528)\n+\n+- Before this release, Bitcoin Core had a strong preference to try to connect only to peers that listen on port 8333. As a result of that, Bitcoin nodes listening on non-standard ports would likely not get any Bitcoin Core peers connecting to them. This preference has been removed. (#23542)\n+\n+- Full support has been added for the CJDNS network. See the new option `-cjdnsreachable` and [doc/cjdns.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/23.x/doc/cjdns.md) (#23077)\n+\n+Fee estimation changes\n+----------------------\n+\n+- Fee estimation now takes the feerate of replacement (RBF) transactions into\n+  account. (#22539)\n+\n+Rescan startup parameter removed\n+--------------------------------\n+\n+The `-rescan` startup parameter has been removed. Wallets which require\n+rescanning due to corruption will still be rescanned on startup.\n+Otherwise, please use the `rescanblockchain` RPC to trigger a rescan. (#23123)\n+\n+Tracepoints and Userspace, Statically Defined Tracing support\n+-------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+Bitcoin Core release binaries for Linux now include experimental tracepoints which\n+act as an interface for process-internal events. These can be used for review,\n+debugging, monitoring, and more. The tracepoint API is semi-stable. While the API\n+is tested, process internals might change between releases requiring changes to the\n+tracepoints. Information about the existing tracepoints can be found under\n+[doc/tracing.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/23.x/doc/tracing.md) and\n+usage examples are provided in [contrib/tracing/](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/23.x/contrib/tracing).\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `validateaddress` RPC now returns an `error_locations` array for invalid\n+  addresses, with the indices of invalid character locations in the address (if\n+  known). For example, this will attempt to locate up to two Bech32 errors, and\n+  return their locations if successful. Success and correctness are only guaranteed\n+  if fewer than two substitution errors have been made.\n+  The error message returned in the `error` field now also returns more specific\n+  errors when decoding fails. (#16807)\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=addresses` configuration option has been removed.  RPCs\n+  `gettxout`, `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`, `decodescript`,\n+  `gettransaction verbose=true` and REST endpoints `/rest/tx`, `/rest/getutxos`,\n+  `/rest/block` no longer return the `addresses` and `reqSigs` fields, which\n+  were previously deprecated in 22.0. (#22650)\n+- The `getblock` RPC command now supports verbosity level 3 containing transaction inputs'\n+  `prevout` information.  The existing `/rest/block/` REST endpoint is modified to contain\n+  this information too. Every `vin` field will contain an additional `prevout` subfield\n+  describing the spent output. `prevout` contains the following keys:\n+  - `generated` - true if the spent coins was a coinbase.\n+  - `height`\n+  - `value`\n+  - `scriptPubKey`\n+\n+- The top-level fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees`\n+  returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`,`getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`\n+  are deprecated and will be removed in the next major version (use\n+  `-deprecated=fees` if needed in this version). The same fee fields can be accessed\n+  through the `fees` object in the result. WARNING: deprecated\n+  fields `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are denominated in sats, whereas all\n+  fields in the `fees` object are denominated in BTC. (#22689)\n+\n+- Both `createmultisig` and `addmultisigaddress` now include a `warnings`\n+  field, which will show a warning if a non-legacy address type is requested\n+  when using uncompressed public keys. (#23113)\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- Information on soft fork status has been moved from `getblockchaininfo`\n+  to the new `getdeploymentinfo` RPC which allows querying soft fork status at any\n+  block, rather than just at the chain tip. Inclusion of soft fork\n+  status in `getblockchaininfo` can currently be restored using the\n+  configuration `-deprecatedrpc=softforks`, but this will be removed in\n+  a future release. Note that in either case, the `status` field\n+  now reflects the status of the current block rather than the next\n+  block. (#23508)\n+\n+Files\n+-----\n+\n+* On startup, the list of banned hosts and networks (via `setban` RPC) in\n+  `banlist.dat` is ignored and only `banlist.json` is considered. Bitcoin Core\n+  version 22.x is the only version that can read `banlist.dat` and also write\n+  it to `banlist.json`. If `banlist.json` already exists, version 22.x will not\n+  try to translate the `banlist.dat` into json. After an upgrade, `listbanned`\n+  can be used to double check the parsed entries. (#22570)\n+\n+Updated settings\n+----------------\n+\n+- In previous releases, the meaning of the command line option\n+  `-persistmempool` (without a value provided) incorrectly disabled mempool\n+  persistence.  `-persistmempool` is now treated like other boolean options to\n+  mean `-persistmempool=1`. Passing `-persistmempool=0`, `-persistmempool=1`\n+  and `-nopersistmempool` is unaffected. (#23061)\n+\n+- `-maxuploadtarget` now allows human readable byte units [k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T].\n+  E.g. `-maxuploadtarget=500g`. No whitespace, +- or fractions allowed.\n+  Default is `M` if no suffix provided. (#23249)\n+\n+- If `-proxy=` is given together with `-noonion` then the provided proxy will\n+  not be set as a proxy for reaching the Tor network. So it will not be\n+  possible to open manual connections to the Tor network for example with the\n+  `addnode` RPC. To mimic the old behavior use `-proxy=` together with\n+  `-onlynet=` listing all relevant networks except `onion`. (#22834)\n+\n+Tools and Utilities\n+-------------------\n+\n+- Update `-getinfo` to return data in a user-friendly format that also reduces vertical space. (#21832)\n+\n+- CLI `-addrinfo` now returns a single field for the number of `onion` addresses\n+  known to the node instead of separate `torv2` and `torv3` fields, as support\n+  for Tor V2 addresses was removed from Bitcoin Core in 22.0. (#22544)\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- Descriptor wallets are now the default wallet type. Newly created wallets\n+  will use descriptors unless `descriptors=false` is set during `createwallet`, or\n+  the `Descriptor wallet` checkbox is unchecked in the GUI.\n+\n+  Note that wallet RPC commands like `importmulti` and `dumpprivkey` cannot be\n+  used with descriptor wallets, so if your client code relies on these commands\n+  without specifying `descriptors=false` during wallet creation, you will need\n+  to update your code.\n+\n+- Newly created descriptor wallets will contain an automatically generated `tr()`\n+  descriptor which allows for creating single key Taproot receiving addresses.\n+\n+- `upgradewallet` will now automatically flush the keypool if upgrading\n+  from a non-HD wallet to an HD wallet, to immediately start using the\n+  newly-generated HD keys. (#23093)\n+\n+- a new RPC `newkeypool` has been added, which will flush (entirely\n+  clear and refill) the keypool. (#23093)\n+\n+- `listunspent` now includes `ancestorcount`, `ancestorsize`, and\n+  `ancestorfees` for each transaction output that is still in the mempool.\n+  (#12677)\n+\n+- `lockunspent` now optionally takes a third parameter, `persistent`, which\n+  causes the lock to be written persistently to the wallet database. This\n+  allows UTXOs to remain locked even after node restarts or crashes. (#23065)\n+\n+- `receivedby` RPCs now include coinbase transactions. Previously, the\n+  following wallet RPCs excluded coinbase transactions: `getreceivedbyaddress`,\n+  `getreceivedbylabel`, `listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`. This\n+  release changes this behaviour and returns results accounting for received\n+  coins from coinbase outputs. The previous behaviour can be restored using the\n+  configuration `-deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase`, but may be removed in a\n+  future release. (#14707)\n+\n+- A new option in the same `receivedby` RPCs, `include_immature_coinbase`\n+  (default=`false`), determines whether to account for immature coinbase\n+  transactions. Immature coinbase transactions are coinbase transactions that\n+  have 100 or fewer confirmations, and are not spendable. (#14707)\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- UTXOs which are locked via the GUI are now stored persistently in the\n+  wallet database, so are not lost on node shutdown or crash. (#23065)\n+\n+- The Bech32 checkbox has been replaced with a dropdown for all address types, including the new Bech32m (BIP-350) standard for Taproot enabled wallets.\n+\n+Low-level changes\n+=================\n+\n+RPC\n+---\n+\n+- `getblockchaininfo` now returns a new `time` field, that provides the chain tip time. (#22407)\n+\n+Tests\n+-----\n+\n+- For the `regtest` network the activation heights of several softforks were\n+  set to block height 1. They can be changed by the runtime setting\n+  `-testactivationheight=name@height`.

Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- A bitcoind node will no longer rumour addresses to inbound peers by default.\n+  They will become eligible for address gossip after sending an ADDR, ADDRV2,\n+  or GETADDR message. (#21528)\n+\n+- Before this release, Bitcoin Core had a strong preference to try to connect only to peers that listen on port 8333. As a result of that, Bitcoin nodes listening on non-standard ports would likely not get any Bitcoin Core peers connecting to them. This preference has been removed. (#23542)\n+\n+- Full support has been added for the CJDNS network. See the new option `-cjdnsreachable` and [doc/cjdns.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/23.x/doc/cjdns.md) (#23077)\n+\n+Fee estimation changes\n+----------------------\n+\n+- Fee estimation now takes the feerate of replacement (RBF) transactions into\n+  account. (#22539)\n+\n+Rescan startup parameter removed\n+--------------------------------\n+\n+The `-rescan` startup parameter has been removed. Wallets which require\n+rescanning due to corruption will still be rescanned on startup.\n+Otherwise, please use the `rescanblockchain` RPC to trigger a rescan. (#23123)\n+\n+Tracepoints and Userspace, Statically Defined Tracing support\n+-------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+Bitcoin Core release binaries for Linux now include experimental tracepoints which\n+act as an interface for process-internal events. These can be used for review,\n+debugging, monitoring, and more. The tracepoint API is semi-stable. While the API\n+is tested, process internals might change between releases requiring changes to the\n+tracepoints. Information about the existing tracepoints can be found under\n+[doc/tracing.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/23.x/doc/tracing.md) and\n+usage examples are provided in [contrib/tracing/](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/23.x/contrib/tracing).\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `validateaddress` RPC now returns an `error_locations` array for invalid\n+  addresses, with the indices of invalid character locations in the address (if\n+  known). For example, this will attempt to locate up to two Bech32 errors, and\n+  return their locations if successful. Success and correctness are only guaranteed\n+  if fewer than two substitution errors have been made.\n+  The error message returned in the `error` field now also returns more specific\n+  errors when decoding fails. (#16807)\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=addresses` configuration option has been removed.  RPCs\n+  `gettxout`, `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`, `decodescript`,\n+  `gettransaction verbose=true` and REST endpoints `/rest/tx`, `/rest/getutxos`,\n+  `/rest/block` no longer return the `addresses` and `reqSigs` fields, which\n+  were previously deprecated in 22.0. (#22650)\n+- The `getblock` RPC command now supports verbosity level 3 containing transaction inputs'\n+  `prevout` information.  The existing `/rest/block/` REST endpoint is modified to contain\n+  this information too. Every `vin` field will contain an additional `prevout` subfield\n+  describing the spent output. `prevout` contains the following keys:\n+  - `generated` - true if the spent coins was a coinbase.\n+  - `height`\n+  - `value`\n+  - `scriptPubKey`\n+\n+- The top-level fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees`\n+  returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`,`getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`\n+  are deprecated and will be removed in the next major version (use\n+  `-deprecated=fees` if needed in this version). The same fee fields can be accessed\n+  through the `fees` object in the result. WARNING: deprecated\n+  fields `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are denominated in sats, whereas all\n+  fields in the `fees` object are denominated in BTC. (#22689)\n+\n+- Both `createmultisig` and `addmultisigaddress` now include a `warnings`\n+  field, which will show a warning if a non-legacy address type is requested\n+  when using uncompressed public keys. (#23113)\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- Information on soft fork status has been moved from `getblockchaininfo`\n+  to the new `getdeploymentinfo` RPC which allows querying soft fork status at any\n+  block, rather than just at the chain tip. Inclusion of soft fork\n+  status in `getblockchaininfo` can currently be restored using the\n+  configuration `-deprecatedrpc=softforks`, but this will be removed in\n+  a future release. Note that in either case, the `status` field\n+  now reflects the status of the current block rather than the next\n+  block. (#23508)\n+\n+Files\n+-----\n+\n+* On startup, the list of banned hosts and networks (via `setban` RPC) in\n+  `banlist.dat` is ignored and only `banlist.json` is considered. Bitcoin Core\n+  version 22.x is the only version that can read `banlist.dat` and also write\n+  it to `banlist.json`. If `banlist.json` already exists, version 22.x will not\n+  try to translate the `banlist.dat` into json. After an upgrade, `listbanned`\n+  can be used to double check the parsed entries. (#22570)\n+\n+Updated settings\n+----------------\n+\n+- In previous releases, the meaning of the command line option\n+  `-persistmempool` (without a value provided) incorrectly disabled mempool\n+  persistence.  `-persistmempool` is now treated like other boolean options to\n+  mean `-persistmempool=1`. Passing `-persistmempool=0`, `-persistmempool=1`\n+  and `-nopersistmempool` is unaffected. (#23061)\n+\n+- `-maxuploadtarget` now allows human readable byte units [k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T].\n+  E.g. `-maxuploadtarget=500g`. No whitespace, +- or fractions allowed.\n+  Default is `M` if no suffix provided. (#23249)\n+\n+- If `-proxy=` is given together with `-noonion` then the provided proxy will\n+  not be set as a proxy for reaching the Tor network. So it will not be\n+  possible to open manual connections to the Tor network for example with the\n+  `addnode` RPC. To mimic the old behavior use `-proxy=` together with\n+  `-onlynet=` listing all relevant networks except `onion`. (#22834)\n+\n+Tools and Utilities\n+-------------------\n+\n+- Update `-getinfo` to return data in a user-friendly format that also reduces vertical space. (#21832)\n+\n+- CLI `-addrinfo` now returns a single field for the number of `onion` addresses\n+  known to the node instead of separate `torv2` and `torv3` fields, as support\n+  for Tor V2 addresses was removed from Bitcoin Core in 22.0. (#22544)\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- Descriptor wallets are now the default wallet type. Newly created wallets\n+  will use descriptors unless `descriptors=false` is set during `createwallet`, or\n+  the `Descriptor wallet` checkbox is unchecked in the GUI.\n+\n+  Note that wallet RPC commands like `importmulti` and `dumpprivkey` cannot be\n+  used with descriptor wallets, so if your client code relies on these commands\n+  without specifying `descriptors=false` during wallet creation, you will need\n+  to update your code.\n+\n+- Newly created descriptor wallets will contain an automatically generated `tr()`\n+  descriptor which allows for creating single key Taproot receiving addresses.\n+\n+- `upgradewallet` will now automatically flush the keypool if upgrading\n+  from a non-HD wallet to an HD wallet, to immediately start using the\n+  newly-generated HD keys. (#23093)\n+\n+- a new RPC `newkeypool` has been added, which will flush (entirely\n+  clear and refill) the keypool. (#23093)\n+\n+- `listunspent` now includes `ancestorcount`, `ancestorsize`, and\n+  `ancestorfees` for each transaction output that is still in the mempool.\n+  (#12677)\n+\n+- `lockunspent` now optionally takes a third parameter, `persistent`, which\n+  causes the lock to be written persistently to the wallet database. This\n+  allows UTXOs to remain locked even after node restarts or crashes. (#23065)\n+\n+- `receivedby` RPCs now include coinbase transactions. Previously, the\n+  following wallet RPCs excluded coinbase transactions: `getreceivedbyaddress`,\n+  `getreceivedbylabel`, `listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`. This\n+  release changes this behaviour and returns results accounting for received\n+  coins from coinbase outputs. The previous behaviour can be restored using the\n+  configuration `-deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase`, but may be removed in a\n+  future release. (#14707)\n+\n+- A new option in the same `receivedby` RPCs, `include_immature_coinbase`\n+  (default=`false`), determines whether to account for immature coinbase\n+  transactions. Immature coinbase transactions are coinbase transactions that\n+  have 100 or fewer confirmations, and are not spendable. (#14707)\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- UTXOs which are locked via the GUI are now stored persistently in the\n+  wallet database, so are not lost on node shutdown or crash. (#23065)\n+\n+- The Bech32 checkbox has been replaced with a dropdown for all address types, including the new Bech32m (BIP-350) standard for Taproot enabled wallets.\n+\n+Low-level changes\n+=================\n+\n+RPC\n+---\n+\n+- `getblockchaininfo` now returns a new `time` field, that provides the chain tip time. (#22407)\n+\n+Tests\n+-----\n+\n+- For the `regtest` network the activation heights of several softforks were\n+  set to block height 1. They can be changed by the runtime setting\n+  `-testactivationheight=name@height`.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- A bitcoind node will no longer rumour addresses to inbound peers by default.\n+  They will become eligible for address gossip after sending an ADDR, ADDRV2,\n+  or GETADDR message. (#21528)\n+\n+- Before this release, Bitcoin Core had a strong preference to try to connect only to peers that listen on port 8333. As a result of that, Bitcoin nodes listening on non-standard ports would likely not get any Bitcoin Core peers connecting to them. This preference has been removed. (#23542)\n+\n+- Full support has been added for the CJDNS network. See the new option `-cjdnsreachable` and [doc/cjdns.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/23.x/doc/cjdns.md) (#23077)\n+\n+Fee estimation changes\n+----------------------\n+\n+- Fee estimation now takes the feerate of replacement (RBF) transactions into\n+  account. (#22539)\n+\n+Rescan startup parameter removed\n+--------------------------------\n+\n+The `-rescan` startup parameter has been removed. Wallets which require\n+rescanning due to corruption will still be rescanned on startup.\n+Otherwise, please use the `rescanblockchain` RPC to trigger a rescan. (#23123)\n+\n+Tracepoints and Userspace, Statically Defined Tracing support\n+-------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+Bitcoin Core release binaries for Linux now include experimental tracepoints which\n+act as an interface for process-internal events. These can be used for review,\n+debugging, monitoring, and more. The tracepoint API is semi-stable. While the API\n+is tested, process internals might change between releases requiring changes to the\n+tracepoints. Information about the existing tracepoints can be found under\n+[doc/tracing.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/23.x/doc/tracing.md) and\n+usage examples are provided in [contrib/tracing/](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/23.x/contrib/tracing).\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `validateaddress` RPC now returns an `error_locations` array for invalid\n+  addresses, with the indices of invalid character locations in the address (if\n+  known). For example, this will attempt to locate up to two Bech32 errors, and\n+  return their locations if successful. Success and correctness are only guaranteed\n+  if fewer than two substitution errors have been made.\n+  The error message returned in the `error` field now also returns more specific\n+  errors when decoding fails. (#16807)\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=addresses` configuration option has been removed.  RPCs\n+  `gettxout`, `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`, `decodescript`,\n+  `gettransaction verbose=true` and REST endpoints `/rest/tx`, `/rest/getutxos`,\n+  `/rest/block` no longer return the `addresses` and `reqSigs` fields, which\n+  were previously deprecated in 22.0. (#22650)\n+- The `getblock` RPC command now supports verbosity level 3 containing transaction inputs'\n+  `prevout` information.  The existing `/rest/block/` REST endpoint is modified to contain\n+  this information too. Every `vin` field will contain an additional `prevout` subfield\n+  describing the spent output. `prevout` contains the following keys:\n+  - `generated` - true if the spent coins was a coinbase.\n+  - `height`\n+  - `value`\n+  - `scriptPubKey`\n+\n+- The top-level fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees`\n+  returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`,`getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`\n+  are deprecated and will be removed in the next major version (use\n+  `-deprecated=fees` if needed in this version). The same fee fields can be accessed\n+  through the `fees` object in the result. WARNING: deprecated\n+  fields `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are denominated in sats, whereas all\n+  fields in the `fees` object are denominated in BTC. (#22689)\n+\n+- Both `createmultisig` and `addmultisigaddress` now include a `warnings`\n+  field, which will show a warning if a non-legacy address type is requested\n+  when using uncompressed public keys. (#23113)\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- Information on soft fork status has been moved from `getblockchaininfo`\n+  to the new `getdeploymentinfo` RPC which allows querying soft fork status at any\n+  block, rather than just at the chain tip. Inclusion of soft fork\n+  status in `getblockchaininfo` can currently be restored using the\n+  configuration `-deprecatedrpc=softforks`, but this will be removed in\n+  a future release. Note that in either case, the `status` field\n+  now reflects the status of the current block rather than the next\n+  block. (#23508)\n+\n+Files\n+-----\n+\n+* On startup, the list of banned hosts and networks (via `setban` RPC) in\n+  `banlist.dat` is ignored and only `banlist.json` is considered. Bitcoin Core\n+  version 22.x is the only version that can read `banlist.dat` and also write\n+  it to `banlist.json`. If `banlist.json` already exists, version 22.x will not\n+  try to translate the `banlist.dat` into json. After an upgrade, `listbanned`\n+  can be used to double check the parsed entries. (#22570)\n+\n+Updated settings\n+----------------\n+\n+- In previous releases, the meaning of the command line option\n+  `-persistmempool` (without a value provided) incorrectly disabled mempool\n+  persistence.  `-persistmempool` is now treated like other boolean options to\n+  mean `-persistmempool=1`. Passing `-persistmempool=0`, `-persistmempool=1`\n+  and `-nopersistmempool` is unaffected. (#23061)\n+\n+- `-maxuploadtarget` now allows human readable byte units [k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T].\n+  E.g. `-maxuploadtarget=500g`. No whitespace, +- or fractions allowed.\n+  Default is `M` if no suffix provided. (#23249)\n+\n+- If `-proxy=` is given together with `-noonion` then the provided proxy will\n+  not be set as a proxy for reaching the Tor network. So it will not be\n+  possible to open manual connections to the Tor network for example with the\n+  `addnode` RPC. To mimic the old behavior use `-proxy=` together with\n+  `-onlynet=` listing all relevant networks except `onion`. (#22834)\n+\n+Tools and Utilities\n+-------------------\n+\n+- Update `-getinfo` to return data in a user-friendly format that also reduces vertical space. (#21832)\n+\n+- CLI `-addrinfo` now returns a single field for the number of `onion` addresses\n+  known to the node instead of separate `torv2` and `torv3` fields, as support\n+  for Tor V2 addresses was removed from Bitcoin Core in 22.0. (#22544)\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- Descriptor wallets are now the default wallet type. Newly created wallets\n+  will use descriptors unless `descriptors=false` is set during `createwallet`, or\n+  the `Descriptor wallet` checkbox is unchecked in the GUI.\n+\n+  Note that wallet RPC commands like `importmulti` and `dumpprivkey` cannot be\n+  used with descriptor wallets, so if your client code relies on these commands\n+  without specifying `descriptors=false` during wallet creation, you will need\n+  to update your code.\n+\n+- Newly created descriptor wallets will contain an automatically generated `tr()`\n+  descriptor which allows for creating single key Taproot receiving addresses.\n+\n+- `upgradewallet` will now automatically flush the keypool if upgrading\n+  from a non-HD wallet to an HD wallet, to immediately start using the\n+  newly-generated HD keys. (#23093)\n+\n+- a new RPC `newkeypool` has been added, which will flush (entirely\n+  clear and refill) the keypool. (#23093)\n+\n+- `listunspent` now includes `ancestorcount`, `ancestorsize`, and\n+  `ancestorfees` for each transaction output that is still in the mempool.\n+  (#12677)\n+\n+- `lockunspent` now optionally takes a third parameter, `persistent`, which\n+  causes the lock to be written persistently to the wallet database. This\n+  allows UTXOs to remain locked even after node restarts or crashes. (#23065)\n+\n+- `receivedby` RPCs now include coinbase transactions. Previously, the\n+  following wallet RPCs excluded coinbase transactions: `getreceivedbyaddress`,\n+  `getreceivedbylabel`, `listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`. This\n+  release changes this behaviour and returns results accounting for received\n+  coins from coinbase outputs. The previous behaviour can be restored using the\n+  configuration `-deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase`, but may be removed in a\n+  future release. (#14707)\n+\n+- A new option in the same `receivedby` RPCs, `include_immature_coinbase`\n+  (default=`false`), determines whether to account for immature coinbase\n+  transactions. Immature coinbase transactions are coinbase transactions that\n+  have 100 or fewer confirmations, and are not spendable. (#14707)\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- UTXOs which are locked via the GUI are now stored persistently in the\n+  wallet database, so are not lost on node shutdown or crash. (#23065)\n+\n+- The Bech32 checkbox has been replaced with a dropdown for all address types, including the new Bech32m (BIP-350) standard for Taproot enabled wallets.\n+\n+Low-level changes\n+=================\n+\n+RPC\n+---\n+\n+- `getblockchaininfo` now returns a new `time` field, that provides the chain tip time. (#22407)\n+\n+Tests\n+-----\n+\n+- For the `regtest` network the activation heights of several softforks were\n+  set to block height 1. They can be changed by the runtime setting\n+  `-testactivationheight=name@height`.
