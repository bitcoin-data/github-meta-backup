    "body": "As compact block completion works currently, nodes reveal precisely the subset of transactions from published blocks that they already have in their mempool when they make a `GETBLOCKTXN` request for the transactions that they are missing during compact block relay. The greatest danger here is that nodes will never request their own transactions. Given a \"sufficient number\" of `GETBLOCKTXN`'s from a single peer, it will become possible to identify their wallet addresses with some degree of confidence. \r\n\r\nAssuming that all transactions except for a node's own, have a nonzero probability of not being in the node's mempool when a block is discovered, an attacker with an infinite set of `GETBLOCKTXN`'s from a single peer that reuses a finite number of pubkeys will have 100% confidence about what addresses belong to that peer.\r\n\r\nI am not a statistician, but I am actively trying to see if I can work out how large, and whether the \"sufficient number\" that gives a reasonable degree of confidence about a peer-pubkey correlation is a realistic scenario or not.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents mempool fingerprinting by randomly adding  ~ 1 in 200 (0.5%) transactions from our mempool to our `GETBLOCKTXN`. Nodes that have less complete mempools (worse connections) will have fewer excess txn's to relay. (Nodes with 50% of block missing from mempool will tend to have about 5 excess transactions requested if there are 2000 txn's in a block) 0.5% is a number I mostly pulled out of thin air but  a maximum impact of 0.5% seems like a reasonable price to pay if the fingerprinting attack described is realistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "It's an interesting observation that our responses to compact block announcements reveal something about our mempool, but I'm not sure it's worth the cost of addressing that:\r\n* Blocks are rare, and very expensive to produce, meaning that per block only a few of our peers even get the chance to query us about it (and it's unaffordable to produce more close-to-tip blocks to trigger that).\r\n* Increasing the size of compact block responses may actually add to propagation latency, especially when it results in a response that now need more TCP packets (the bandwidth isn't the concern here).\r\n* Just empirically, compact block relay works very well (on my well-connected node without wallets, 91% of blocks are reconstructed without asking for any transactions; 3.6% need 1 transaction; 3.2% need 2 transactions; 0.5% need 3 transactions; 1.1% need several). So even when our peers get a chance to learn something, there generally is very little to learn.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to do something about this information leak nonetheless, I believe the right approach would be using the `m_recently_announced_invs` filter which we maintain for all our peers, and just add all transactions to the compact block response that we haven't told our peer about yet (and if there are too many, perhaps just immediately fall back to standard block relay).",

      "body": "> I agree with @sipa, with a stronger emphasis that I would probably NACK this change because the cost of this fix is too high, and the privacy gain is too low.\r\n\r\nYeah, Approach NACK. I may be convinced that doing *something* to avoid mempool fingerprinting through GETBLOCKTXN is worth it, but if we want that, there are better ways than this.\r\n\r\n> Note that it's very easy for an adversary to change that by simply broadcasting simultaneous double-spends with the same fee. Indeed, n-way double spends broadcast to n different nodes is easy to do. So I don't think the observation that it works well right now is relevant to the adversarial case.\r\n\r\nThat's fair; the other arguments are stronger.\r\n\r\n> Wouldn't it be better to not add wallet transactions to the mempool if we don't want peers to query our mempool for wallet transactions?\r\n\r\nI don't think that's a good idea. The point is that we shouldn't treat wallet transactions any differently from transactions received from other peers. If we don't add wallet transactions to the mempool but still relay them (because otherwise nobody will ever know about them), we're adding a giant fingerprint to identify our transactions (relayed but not in mempool...).\r\n\r\nI think the focus of this PR on wallet transactions in general is distracting. The issue, if any, is mempool fingerprinting. That might be used by attackers to learn about our wallet transactions, but also about many other things. But the solution isn't specific to wallet things; it should just be to prevent attackers from learning anything about our mempool transactions that haven't been announced to them.",

Given this issue here (and past ones), it just seems hard to think about and any guarantees are at best brittle in an evolving P2P network. So, long term, assuming the private \"first mile\" privacy-preserving fan out stuff is available, users and wallets caring about it will probably use that. Attempts to optimize the normal relay to be equally privacy-preserving will always have a taste of a false promise and it might be more honest to just tell people to not rely on that.",

But on the other hand, we go through pretty substantial efforts to hide *lots* of things on a best-effort basis, especially involving transaction relay. And they're not all reducible to protecting wallet privacy (there is eclipse attack protection, fingerprinting for connection graph information, ...).",
