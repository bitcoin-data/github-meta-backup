      "body": "Sorry, meant to say, that it could re-check the invalid again upon start up, perhaps by giving a command line option or perhaps automatically whenever the invalid again is longer by 6 blocks or more.\n\nSent from my Nokia phone\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Pieter Wuille\nSent:  17/05/2012 11:10:55\nSubject:  Re: [bitcoin] Hopefully final fix for the stuck blockchain issue (#1315)\n\nA bit more elaborate: if you were running an 0.6 RC, you would have code that used the old BIP16 switchover date. The date passed, but you did not update your software. Suddenly someone sends an invalid BIP transaction (so, one that is valid according to the traditional rules, but not according to the BIP16 rules). On the main network BIP16 validation is not active, so the transaction gets accepted. However, your old RC enforces BIP16 validation, so it considers this transaction invalid. This only happens after downloading the block that contains it, and adding it to the tree in the database. A few hundred blocks are added on top of this one, all in your database, but this chain does not become the best chain (as it is considers invalid).\n\nFinally, you upgrade your software, and you now have the correct BIP16 switchover date. The correct chain is already downloaded in your block database, but it is not marked as the active best chain. At startup, your node sends a getblocks from its current best tip (which is one block before the one that contained the invalid BIP16 transactions) to the top of the chain. The peer answers by sending 500 invs back, and remembers to request 500 more when the last of those is downloaded. However, we already have the first 500, so not one is requested, and nothing happens. We must somehow make the peer send us the rest of the invs, as that is our only means for reconnecting that chain to the current best block. Earlier versions of this patch forced a getdata of that 500th block, this one sends a getblocks immediately.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1315#issuecomment-5761362\n",
