    "body": "To characterize a transaction as standard or non-standard, Bitcoin Core tries to estimate the number of signature checks a particular script can potentially request. A maximum of 15 signature checks is allowed. The function GetSigopCount() \r\n counts the maximum number of signature checks performed by a script.\r\nFor each CHECKSIG or CHECKSIGVERIFY found in a script, one is added to the signature check counter. For multisigs, the maximum number of checks depends on the number of signatories. When CHECKMULTISIG is executed, this number is at the top of the stack. However, to avoid executing the script to obtain the top of the stack value, Bitcoin Core performs an estimation based on static analysis of the script, which returns only an upper bound. This is what GetSigOpCount(true) does. However, the static analysis is very rudimentary, and it overestimates the signature checks for certain common scripts.\r\n\r\n**How GetSigOpCount() works**\r\n\r\nGetSigOpCount() assumes that the number of signers is pushed into the stack immediately before the CHECKMULTISIG opcode. If the previous opcode is not a push opcode, then this function assumes the worst case for each CHECKMULTISIG found, which is 20 signatures (defined by MAX_PUBKEYS_PER_MULTISIG). The problem is that this constant is greater than the maximum number of checks allowed per P2SH redeem script, which means that any P2SH script that uses CHECKMULTISIG must specify the number of signers with a PUSH opcode right before.   \r\n\r\n**The bug in the RSK sidechain**\r\n\r\nTo add a time-locked emergency multisig to RSK powpeg, the RSK community, with the help of RSK core developers, migrated the multisig script that holds the funds of the peg from a traditional P2SH multisig to the following transaction redeem script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOP_NOTIF \r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_M\r\n\tOP_PUSHBYTES_33 pubkey1\r\n\t...\r\n\tOP_PUSHBYTES_33 pubkeyN\r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_N \r\nOP_ELSE \r\n\tOP_PUSHBYTES_3 <time-lock-value>\r\n\tOP_CSV \r\n\tOP_DROP \r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_3 \r\n\tOP_PUSHBYTES_33 emergencyPubkey1\r\n\tâ€¦\r\n\tOP_PUSHBYTES_33 emergencyPubkey4\r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_4 \r\nOP_ENDIF \r\nOP_CHECKMULTISIG\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe see that there are two script paths and, to reduce the script size, a single CHECKMULTISIG is used for the two paths, separating the signer count from the CHECKMULTISIG opcode. This script worked on testnet, because it lacks the standard checks performed in Mainnet. \r\nThe Liquid sidechain uses a very similar script, but using segwit addresses. \r\n\r\nWe can see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d492dc1cdaabdc52b0766bf4cba4bd73178325d0/src/script/script.cpp#L153) that GetSigOpCount() will find that END_IF is not a push opcode and will assume the number of signature checks is MAX_PUBKEYS_PER_MULTISIG.\r\n\r\n**Motivation for Changing Bitcoin's standard rules**\r\n\r\nSince having two execution paths for two different multisigs, one of them usually time-locked, is a very common use case, Bitcoin users can benefit from relaxing the standard rule and making two-paths multisigs standard.\r\nThe alternate way of having two-paths multisigs is by adding the CHECKMULTISIG at the end of every path. However, this reduces the maximum number of functionaries of the first (non time-locked) multisig, since the sum of both must be below 15.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit is that this change separates the new GetStandardSigOpCount() function used for standard rules from the old GetSigOpCount() method that is used in consensus code (both with fAccurate==true and fAccurate=false). This is very important because consensus rules should not be mixed with non-consensus rules in a dangerous way, as it is today.\r\n\r\nAn additional benefit for the RSK community is that if Bitcoin Core implements this improvement, the RSK community avoids preparing and activating a hard-fork to unblock the funds in the peg.\r\n\r\nI include additional unit tests to show that:\r\n\r\n* Only a single level of nesting is supported. \"IF ELSE ENDIF CHECKMULTISIG\" is supported but \"IF IF ENDIF ENDIF CHECKMULTISIG\" is not supported. \r\n* There must be only two paths (IF ELSE ELSE ELSE ENDIF CHECKMULTISIG\" not supported).\r\n* The change does not affect any other script standard rules, apart from the two-paths multisig.\r\n* The change does not modify consensus rules.\r\n",

      "body": "Interesting Script edge case!\r\n\r\nYou must have balanced the cost of proposing this standardness rule change, and making a PR touching consensus code, with switching to using Segwit scripts (either v0 or v1) which don't have this limitation (and have other advantages). Is there a particular reason why you can't migrate to Segwit?\r\n\r\n> Motivation for Changing Bitcoin's standard rules\r\n> Since having two execution paths for two different multisigs, one of them usually time-locked, is a very common use case, Bitcoin users can benefit from relaxing the standard rule and making two-paths multisigs standard.\r\nThe alternate way of having two-paths multisigs is by adding the CHECKMULTISIG at the end of every path. However, this reduces the maximum number of functionaries of the first (non time-locked) multisig, since the sum of both must be below 15.\r\n\r\nBitcoin users would probably just do that under P2WSH or Taproot nowadays. And that would be standard. But even under P2SH context it's far from being the only alternative. You could also just count public keys, for instance (untested):\r\n```\r\nIF\r\n  <pk_1> CHECKSIG SWAP\r\n  <pk_2> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  ...\r\n  <pk_n> CHECKSIG ADD\r\n  <m> EQUAL\r\nELSE\r\n  <timelock> CSV DROP\r\n  <pk_1'> CHECKSIG SWAP\r\n  <pk_2'> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  <pk_3'> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  <pk_4'> CHECKSIG ADD\r\n  <3> EQUAL\r\nENDIF\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a small number of pubkeys this is standard under P2SH, and the next limit you'd hit would probably be `MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE` that limits the size of the redeem Script.\r\n\r\nWriting Scripts by hand is a huge footgun, and we now have [tooling to do that safely](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). The implementation of Miniscript in Bitcoin Core does not support P2SH context. But [other implementations do](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript) if you really can't migrate to at least Segwit v0.",

      "body": "> You must have balanced the cost of proposing this standardness rule change, and making a PR touching consensus code, with switching to using Segwit scripts (either v0 or v1) which don't have this limitation (and have other advantages)\r\n\r\nThe cost for the RSK community to modify RSK to switch to segwit is very high, as it is a hard-fork. All the code that produces and interprets Bitcoin transactions is consensus code in RSK. \r\nOur current highest priority is to unblock the funds in the peg (currently one or more mining pools will temporarily help RSK to deliver the non-standard transactions into blocks, but this is far from ideal, as it affects RSK decentralization). \r\nWe cannot migrate to segwit as an emergency hard-fork. It would need months of development, months of testing, more months for activation on testnet, etc. We have already created a patch to migrate to the following redeem script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOP_NOTIF \r\n\t...\r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_N \r\n\tOP_CHECKMULTISIG\r\nOP_ELSE \r\n\tâ€¦\r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_4 \r\n        OP_CHECKMULTISIG\r\nOP_ENDIF \r\n\r\n```\r\nBut this is still a hard-fork, and the full upgrade can take several weeks, considering the public review stage and all further stages.\r\n\r\nThe RSK community mid-term plan is to migrate to segwit. \r\n\r\nRegarding touching the consensus code, I firmly believe that GetSigOpCount() should be split in two functions: one that is called only by consensus code and one that is only called by AreInputsStandard(). This is obvious to me, since the standard rules can change over time, but not the consensus rules, and there is a real risk that a tweak of the standard rules ends up hiding an unintended consensus change. I was surprised to discover that GetSigOpCount() is called by consensus code with fAccurate==true and fAccurate==false, so basically that function should be set in stone.\r\n\r\nTherefore, even if the you are in doubt if the addition of two-paths multisigs is a benefit, I hope you still see the benefit to split GetSigOpCount() into two initially mirrored functions with different names, and we can do this in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n",

To be clear i'm not opposing relaxing this standardness rule on its own, i'm just questioning whether it's worth it.\r\n\r\nYou mention the mid-term plan is for RSK to migrate to Segwit. But proposing a standardness rule change does not seem like a short-term plan to me: even in the best case scenario that this PR is getting enough interest, review (i haven't looked at the code yet but it's currently failing CI) and gets eventually merged before the next release branch-off, then that a release gets shipped with the new standardness rule and that at least part of the nodes and hashrate upgrade to this new rule. That's what, 1 year at least before your transactions get relayed? Is it reasonable to rely on direct communication with mining pools for that long? And won't the switch to Segwit happen before that?",

      "body": "Regarding the CI failure, I fixed it. But this brings an interesting topic to discuss (separate of this patch):\r\n\r\nInvalid scripts are detected obviously at some later moment and transactions containing invalid scripts are never accepted into the memory pool.\r\nHowever, in case GetStandardSigOpCount() detects and invalid script (i.e. staring with ENDIF)  it's difficult to decide what GetStandardSigOpCount() should return.  If it returns 0, you let a script containing too many checksigs be executed by the node. This is bad, but gives the node the opportunity to ban the peer that sent the invalid transaction. If it returns a high value, you avoid high computations, but at the same time you do not get the chance to penalize the peer that sent the bad transaction.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, on an invalid script detected:\r\n\r\noption 1) return 20 -> avoid heavy computations, do not penalize\r\noption 2) return 0 -> let  heavy computations be performed, penalize\r\noption 3) continue but  revert to how the old GetSigOpCount() worked\r\n\r\nMy code currently does 3, from the point the script is detected as invalid.",

The existence of the Rootstock sidechain is a proof that the two-path multisig script is useful.\r\n\r\nTemporarily some miners will apply this patch, and then the rootstock community will switch to an alternate script (that supports less signatories) so that miners can later revert the patch. \r\nBut the expectation in the rootstock community is that Rootstock can go back to the previous script in ~1 year if most Bitcoin nodes and miners consider this script standard. Switching to segwit IS an alternative, but the rootstock core devs are extremely caution on upgrading this core functionality of Rootstock, as the risks are high.\r\n \r\n ",

      "body": "> Therefore we can assume that MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS being low is a protection against quadratic-hashing attacks.\r\n\r\nI think `MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS` is just `floor(MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE/CPubKey::COMPRESSED_SIZE) = floor(520/33) = floor(15.75..)` -- so the only way you could have more sigops than that is if you're doing multiple signatures by the same key (via `OP_DUP`) or if you're letting the signer provide keys as part of the p2sh stack.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I don't see how you get more than 10 normal keys in the script you've presented in the first place: the `NOTIF .. ELSE <h> CSV DROP 3 <e1> <e2> <e3> <e4> 4 ENDIF CHECKMULTISIG` part of your script will consume 148 bytes, leaving only 372 bytes for `<m> <key1> .. <keyn> <n>` which for n=10 consumes 342 bytes, and for n=11 would already overflow at 376 bytes. I believe that would cause a `SCRIPT_ERR_PUSH_SIZE` on the first run through of `EvalScript`, prior to the `SCRIPT_VERIFY_P2SH` run.\r\n\r\nPlaying with miniscript suggests a solution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIF\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(K1)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG TOALT\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(K2)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG FROMALT ADD TOALT\r\n  ..\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(Kn)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG FROMALT ADD\r\n  <m>\r\nELSE\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(E1)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG TOALT\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(E2)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG FROMALT ADD TOALT\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(E3)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG FROMALT ADD TOALT\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(E4)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG FROMALT ADD\r\n  <d> CSV DROP\r\n  3\r\nENDIF\r\nEQUAL\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would let you have n=14 via a 508 byte script (n=15 gives a 536 byte script). (If your emergency keys are also valid for regular usage, you could increase that up to n=18).\r\n\r\nIn general, the pkh approach would allow up to 20 distinct keys in a p2sh script (eg, if you wanted a 20-of-20 multisig), absent the `MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS` restriction. That makes me lean towards thinking it could make sense to increase `MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS` to 20.\r\n\r\n> Therefore, changing MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS to match exactly MAX_PUBKEYS_PER_MULTISIG, even if trivial, slightly degrades Bitcoin's DoS security.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is meaningfully true? You get `O(N**2)` hashing due to `N` being the number of signatures across the entire transaction (and also proportional to the overall size of the transaction), not just for a single input; so, assuming you're constrained to spending p2sh inputs, a 100kB tx would go from perhaps 1455 signatures (144MB of hashed data) to 1480 signatures (146MB of hashed data). (If you're able to construct bare multisig inputs, then you can do 1560 sigs in a standard tx (155MB of hashed data), though the setup for your attack will then be visible).\r\n\r\nI'm assuming a p2sh script of `<n> <pubkey> {DUP}*n <n> CHECKMULTISIG` for `n` equals 15 or 20 and that the signatures set R=G/2, to generate those numbers; I haven't checked how legacy hashing works in detail to be sure that actually generates `n` hashes over the entire tx rather than having some things cached.  Presuming you can't reuse signatures, and each signature is at least [57 bytes](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-November/000344.html) then a 100kB tx can't contain more than 1754 signatures, providing an upper bound of 175MB of hashing, presuming the interpreter is clever enough to only do one hash per signature.\r\n\r\nIn the worst conceivable case, where you somehow achieve 15 sigops with a 107 byte script (34 bytes to push a pubkey, 58 bytes to push a tiny exploitable signature, and 15 opcodes to generate 15 sigops from that), that would result in a 100kB tx requiring 1GB of hashing, while having 20 opcodes generate 20 sigops would result in 1.3GB of hashing (ie a 29% increase, vs the 33% increase of 20 vs 15).\r\n\r\nIf you're a miner, you're not constrained to 100kB txs, but in that case you're also not constrained by MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS either.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion:\r\n * I think that the `IF .. n CHECKMULTISIG ELSE .. 4 CHECKMULTISIG ENDIF` [approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26348#issuecomment-1301000985) is strictly superior to the original proposal, as neither are able to support n>11.\r\n * For a short-term workaround, if I were a miner, I think the lower complexity of just increasing MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS from 15 to 20 is more appealing than running this patch.\r\n * I think RSK switching to segwit or taproot makes more sense than spending much development effort here\r\n * If RSK or others really want to do n>11 via p2sh and not p2wsh/p2tr, then increasing MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS from 15 to 20 in general seems plausible to me, but it's not at all clear it's worth the effort of either being sure that it doesn't make quadratic hashing more problematic, or improving the interpreter's caching to prevent that from being a problem.",

The commit_federation tx that updated to that address on the RSK chain seems to be https://explorer.rsk.co/tx/0x83708fd332cbe0f9614dd61d0c95c729aded0b7a94d793f22412493d6f867b43?__ctab=Logs but that just has the address hardcoded in the data as hex, and as far as I've tried, I can't make the newFederationBtcPublicKeys listed there and any of the script templates and emergency keys match up with the 3Dsne address; there's a tool at https://github.com/rsksmart/powpeg-details/ that seems like it should be able to provide the redeem script, but also doesn't seem to produce a match (it doesn't help that there seems to have been a [bug](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1826/commits/e8fb2c3fe9b8021af263b3a0f5738547545ecb05) where the CSV value was pushed with the wrong endinaness in some versions).\r\n\r\nThat stops me from being able to confirm that increasing MAX_P2SH_SIG_OPS actually unsticks these transactions.\r\n\r\nIf increasing MAX_P2SH_SIG_OPS does fix the problem, I think that is the immediate fix, and switching to `IF .. CHECKMULTSIG ELSE .. CHECKMULTISIG ENDIF` (see [RSKIP353](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP353.md)) is the short/medium term solution (hopefully prior to switching to segwit/taproot over the medium/long term).\r\n\r\nSome RSK addresses on bitcoin testnet are:\r\n\r\n * https://mempool.space/testnet/address/2N1rW3cBZNzs2ZxSfyNW7cMcNBktt6fzs88 (post RSKIP353) \r\n * https://mempool.space/testnet/address/2NF9ndVaez5owUShjSxNnY2E31QkRjLu63k (post RSKIP353)\r\n * https://mempool.space/testnet/address/2N1y7hSneV9HuWnpLTtGqdRnway1Ag3dQoj (suffering from the bug here)\r\n\r\nThose at least seem like they match the script template in the way I'd expect.",

That only touches policy and test code so is hopefully fairly easy to verify for correctness, and should be a trivial merge on top of either 24.0.1 or master.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it would make sense to merge in general though, as the risk of expanding the attack service for quadratic hashing does exist, and the benefits of being able to do weird multisig things in p2sh rather than switching to segwit or taproot seem very small.\r\n\r\nEven if it's not merged in core, I think it would be reasonable for miners to run that patch temporarily in order to unstick RSK peg-out transactions, without requiring constant manual intervention.\r\n\r\nIf a miner really wanted to make sure that they don't introduce additional quadratic hashing risk, then I think you could set things up as follows:\r\n\r\n * public node 1, with `MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS=20` and `-limitancestorsize=86`\r\n * public node 2, default settings, with `MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS` unchanged at 15 -- presumably advertised somehow to RSK folks can manually connect to it and send txs.\r\n * private node, producing block templates for mining, connected to public node 1 and 2, with `MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS=20` and the default `-limitancestorsize`\r\n\r\nSetting `limitancestorsize` would mean that even if the increase in MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS allows you to do an additional 33% of sighash operations per byte, you're reducing both the bytes that you're hashing and the number of sighash operations to 86%, and `86%*86%*133% < 100%`. Past RSK txs seem to be capped at either 50 inputs or 50kB, either of which should work fine with that limitation.",
