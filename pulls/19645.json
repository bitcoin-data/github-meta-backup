    "body": "Accepting a transaction to the mempool only succeeds if this transaction\r\nisn't already present. This check operating on txid, it prevents new\r\nsubmissions of the transaction with identical non-witness data but\r\nsmaller valid witnesses. Therefore, overall mempool feerate won't improve\r\neven if such higher-feerate mempool candidate is learnt through wtxid-relay.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes mempool and transaction broadcast already-present checks\r\nfrom transaction's txid to its wtxid.\r\n\r\nA new-wtxid submission may still fail due to replacement rules in\r\nfunction of local policy settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n@jnewbery RE: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18044#discussion_r460704950 I think we agree on the \"same txid, different txids\" nonsense, I didn't mean to track multiple witnesses for one txid rather to accept and rebroadcast \"the best mempool candidate known for a given txid\". A script may have alternatives solvable branches and witnesses to spend them might be different in weight thus creating wtxid with divergent feerates. A best known candidate with regards to a txid is defined as a higher-feerate witness (a smaller one) transaction than our current in mempool one, with identical non-witness data.\r\n\r\nYou might submit a txidA:wtxid1 to your local node, and schedule it for initial-broadcast reattempt. Few minutes, latter you announce to your node a higher-feerate txidA:wtxid2, which effectively replace wtxid1. At `ReattemptInitialBroadcast`, only wtxid2 will be rebroadcast if needed, as best known candidate for txidA. According to me, that's where unbroadcast semantic is unclear, to which wtxid the user should expect seeing \"broadcast-reattempt\" property guarantee ?\r\n\r\nGiven our current relay policy default, I concede this is rather a marginal case, beyond illustrating another limit of our mempool replacement rules. In the future, it's likely to worsen as taproot make it far easier to create witnesses with divergent feerates (e.g a 1-of-1 tapscript compared to a 15-of-15 one). In case of concurrent broadcast, the mempool won't necessary learn the best-feerate candidate. That said, IMO, it's worthy to fix because \"txn-already-in-mempool\" isn't accurate anymore in a wtxid-relay context.",

Further, this opens up potential attacks where you can make malleable smaller and smaller witnesses and keep resubmitting to boost feerate or something. I also think it's sufficiently rare that we'd even have smaller valid witnesses to submit, but then if someone starts relying on this behavior we're stuck supporting it forever.\r\n\r\nwhere you might convince me that it's a problem is if Alice and Bob are doing a payjoin or something, and then Bob changes his witness to be an even bigger one and then broadcasts, locking Alice onto a lower fee rate for the transaction.\r\n\r\nBut again, on urgency, these replacement policies are really only relevant once more complex taproot scripts are widely deployed and a change like this can be added to a future release policy easily.",

      "body": "> I don't think this is urgent to fix and incentivizes using the mempool as working space for negotiating smaller witnesses, rather than attempting to produce a smaller signature on first broadcast.\r\n\r\nI think the notion of first broadcast doesn't hold when you have multiple-party involved with alternatives spending paths and so potential concurrent broadcasts. Parties can't produce smaller signatures because key distribution across script branches encodes a policy, it can be either Alice or Bob+Caroll+Dave, where Alice has a higher level of privileges. As a practical example you might have pre-signed vault transactions, like https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-April/017793.html\r\n\r\n> Further, this opens up potential attacks where you can make malleable smaller and smaller witnesses and keep resubmitting to boost feerate or something.\r\n\r\nYou're still liable to RBF rules compliance, especially rule 4 on incremental relay fee ?\r\n\r\n> where you might convince me that it's a problem is if Alice and Bob are doing a payjoin or something, and then Bob changes his witness to be an even bigger one and then broadcasts, locking Alice onto a lower fee rate for the transaction.\r\n\r\nAs a first step you should avoid to introduce witness malleability if parties are distrusted, and currently as I mentioned it won't likely propagate due to default mempool settings. But yes if we change it in the future, it would be a limited guardrail for this kind of scenario.\r\n\r\nThere is no urgency to fix, it's more making consistent our relay wtxid-policy with our mempool one.\r\n",

But that would require special RBF rules to handle it and I think it's better to strictly bound to our current RBF rules to make it easier to reason on. We already have the same issue with someone replacing a parent tx with a new txid and advertising again a chain of transaction paying the same outputs. Cheap RBF replacement should be addressed on its own, this PR doesn't pretend to make it better or worse ?\r\n\r\n> Is there any application out there that would expect to use this behavior? \r\n\r\nBeyond preventing abuse for potential coinjoin/payjoin/vaults and easing future usage for taproot branches, as of today there is the practical usage of selecting your best-feerate witness among a set of valid ones. I don't think a lot of users have yet this mental model but I expect this to change with wider adoption of Miniscript.\r\n\r\nUpdated with better comment/logs.

Initially called it \"wtxid-acceptance\" as this is literally what this PR does, evaluating an already-present utxo-spend candidate on wtxid rather than txid. In practice, I agree that txid is what matters, like evaluating descendants limits. Note, for implementation simplicity, it does evict descendants from mempool, we can implement in-place substitution as a follow-up if it feels needed.\r\n\r\nFor the taproot hint, I think that rational holds, as from the miner viewpoint you want to increase feerate per weight unit. I don't think that effective memory-space of these weight units is a burden for miner mempools.",

Or single-input, if by decomposing multiple known witnesses and analyzing witnessScript we're able to compress to a better feerate witness ? \r\n\r\nEither way, I think what your question is raising is a _separation of concerns_ across the bitcoin stack. I don't think that's the job of network mempools to optimize your spends based on a set of witness element you may have broadcasted. This sounds like a new DoS vector and you would need to pay for the CPU time, thus reducing worthiness of operation.\r\n\r\nI think that composing best-feerate witness in function of your solvable scripts paths is better done by a higher tool. Of course, this software may not implement correctly all weight accounting rules, especially post-Taproot, so this PR allows you to verify composed witnesses against your local mempool, assuming you set `incrementalrelayfee=0`.",

And a honest participant can't rely on RBF as it's easy for a malicious party to attach a high-absolute-fee, low-feerate chain of transactions to its change output \r\n\r\nOf course you can adopt carve-out mechanism and ensure you don't have more than one immediately spendable output by party but this come with far less protocol flexibility and you might loss few blocks between initial broadcast and trigger of your fee-bump.\r\n\r\nI agree that change advocated in this PR won't fix it without further modifications to our RBF policy but it's at least a minimal prerequisite. \r\n\r\nOr do you think we should first have a broader discussion on the mental model that higher protocol designers should adopt with regards to our mempool/relay policy ?",

Or single-input, if by decomposing multiple known witnesses and analyzing witnessScript we're able to compress to a better feerate witness ?\r\n> \r\n> Either way, I think what your question is raising is a _separation of concerns_ across the bitcoin stack. I don't think that's the job of network mempools to optimize your spends based on a set of witness element you may have broadcasted. This sounds like a new DoS vector and you would need to pay for the CPU time, thus reducing worthiness of operation.\r\n\r\nIt's not optimizing your spends, it's optimizing miner revenue, which is ~the whole point.\r\n\r\nIn terms of DoS the issue that also occurs is that someone can malicious anti-merge your better witness, e.g.,\r\n\r\nI see B which is better for every input then A, and then I cut B's witness with half A's witnesses, then broadcast. Now B is not minrelay increment better  than half B half A, so i get pinned.\r\n",

Currently, with a default incrementalrelayfee > 0, this PR isn't not going to mitigate the pinning issue network-wise as the absolute fee is committed as part of the txid and thus is strictly the _same_ between a divergent-wtxids/equivalent-txid transaction pair.\r\n\r\nIt needs more thoughts that the current PR which is more providing locally fee estimation between different witnesses to a user.",
