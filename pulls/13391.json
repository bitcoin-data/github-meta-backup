    "body": "Make tinyformat `noexcept`: Use tinyformat's default error handling (`assert(0 && reason);`) instead of throwing `tinyformat::format_error` on incorrect format strings.\r\n\r\nThe only place where `tinyformat::format_error` was handled was in `LogPrintf(...)` where it was handled to generate output which is equivalent to what `assert(0 && reason);` provides.\r\n\r\nIncorrect format strings are best handled explicitly locally in a \"fail fast\" manner. No need for propagation.\r\n\r\nSince tinyformat is used extensively via `strprintf(â€¦)` large parts of the code base are switched from an implicit \"might throw `tinyformat::format_error`\" to \"will not throw\" from a compiler/static analyzer perspective with this change.\r\n\r\nReducing the number of unnecessary exceptions thrown increases the signal-to-noise for humans when analyzing potential issues introduced by uncaught exceptions.\r\n\r\nThese were the conditions that threw `tinyformat::format_error` prior to this commit:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep TINYFORMAT_ERROR\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:// Error handling: Define TINYFORMAT_ERROR to customize the error handling for\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:#define TINYFORMAT_ERROR(reasonString) throw tinyformat::format_error(reasonString)\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:#ifndef TINYFORMAT_ERROR\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:#   define TINYFORMAT_ERROR(reason) assert(0 && reason)\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:        TINYFORMAT_ERROR(\"tinyformat: Cannot convert from argument type to \"\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:        TINYFORMAT_ERROR(\"tinyformat: Not enough conversion specifiers in format string\");\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:            TINYFORMAT_ERROR(\"tinyformat: Not enough arguments to read variable width\");\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:                TINYFORMAT_ERROR(\"tinyformat: Not enough arguments to read variable precision\");\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:            TINYFORMAT_ERROR(\"tinyformat: the %a and %A conversion specs \"\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:            TINYFORMAT_ERROR(\"tinyformat: %n conversion spec not supported\");\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:            TINYFORMAT_ERROR(\"tinyformat: Conversion spec incorrectly \"\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:            TINYFORMAT_ERROR(\"tinyformat: Not enough format arguments\");\r\nsrc/tinyformat.h:        TINYFORMAT_ERROR(\"tinyformat: Too many conversion specifiers in format string\");\r\n```",

I've now reverted the `tinyformat.h` change to tinyformat code from upstream (the `noexcept` addition).\r\n\r\nCould you describe the issue that resulted in a near DoS vulnerability? As I read it #9963 was more about developer ergonomics? :-)\r\n\r\nCould a middle ground be to make `strprintf(â€¦)` `noexcept` and keep `LogPrintf(...)` as is?\r\n\r\nNone of the callers of `strprintf(â€¦)` handle `tinyformat::format_error` from what I can see. Also, it is the `strprintf(â€¦)` calls that create all the noise when I'm analyzing uncaught exceptions :-)\r\n\r\n",

As I read it #9963 was more about developer ergonomics? :-)\r\n\r\nI think we intentionally didn't mention the issue there.\r\nIt's very simply: have an under-tested error path in the network code with an invalid LogPrintf() spec. Anything that triggers this will crash the process. A little loggable offense turns into a full DoS vector.\r\n\r\n> Could a middle ground be to make strprintf(â€¦) noexcept and keep LogPrintf(...) as is?\r\n\r\nI think that would be a better idea. If the output isn't just used for logging, it's a more serious error in any case.",
