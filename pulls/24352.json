I also don't think the mermaid graph looks too bad, and I think it's certainly preferably to maintaining some kind of in-repo image. I say we keep it.\r\n\r\nI think the constraints you outline later in the document (module X should never depend on module Y etc.) is very helpful information - can it be enforced somehow at the build system level? Obviously we'd know if there were ever violations because it'd be clear (I think) from Makefile changes, but wondering if there's some extra step we could take.",

It could run `nm src/libbitcoin_util.a` etc, look at all the symbols each library defines (`T`), and all the symbols each library uses (`U`), and make sure libraries only uses symbols from libraries they are allowed to depend on.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There are few or no restrictions on backwards compatibility or rules about external dependencies. Exceptions are `libbitcoin_consensus` and `libbitcoin_kernel` which have external interfaces documented at [../shared-libraries.md](../shared-libraries.md).\n+\n+- Generally speaking each library should correspond to a source directory and a namespace. Source code organization is a work in progress, so it is true that some namespaces are applied inconsistently, and if you look at [`libbitcoin_*_SOURCES`](../../src/Makefile.am) lists you can see that many libraries pull in files from outside their source directory. But generally when working with libraries, it is good to follow an establishing pattern like:\n+\n+  - `libbitcoin_node` code lives in `src/node/` in the `node::` namespace\n+  - `libbitcoin_wallet` code lives in `src/wallet/` in the `wallet::` namespace\n+  - `libbitcoin_ipc` code lives in `src/ipc/` in the `ipc::` namespace\n+  - `libbitcoin_util` code lives in `src/util/` in the `util::` namespace\n+  - `libbitcoin_consensus` code lives in `src/consensus/` in the `Consensus::` namespace\n+\n+## Dependencies\n+\n+- Libraries should generally be careful about what other libraries they depend on, and only reference symbols following the arrows shown in the dependency graph below:\n+\n+```mermaid\n+graph TD;",

For example, there is no arrow connecting *libbitcoin_wallet* and *libbitcoin_node* libraries, because these libraries are intended to be modular and not depend on each other's internal implementation details. But wallet code still is still able to call node code indirectly through the `interfaces::Chain` abstract class in [`interfaces/chain.h`](../../src/interfaces/chain.h) and node code calls wallet code through the `interfaces::ChainClient` and `interfaces::Chain::Notifications` abstract classes in the same file. In general, defining abstract classes in [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/) can be a convenient way of avoiding unwanted direct dependencies or circular dependencies between libraries.\n+\n+- *libbitcoin_consensus* should be a standalone dependency that any library can depend on, and it should not depend on any other libraries itself.\n+\n+- *libbitcoin_util* should also be a standalone dependency that any library can depend on, and it should not depend on other internal libraries.

There are few or no restrictions on backwards compatibility or rules about external dependencies. Exceptions are `libbitcoin_consensus` and `libbitcoin_kernel` which have external interfaces documented at [../shared-libraries.md](../shared-libraries.md).\n+\n+- Generally speaking each library should correspond to a source directory and a namespace. Source code organization is a work in progress, so it is true that some namespaces are applied inconsistently, and if you look at [`libbitcoin_*_SOURCES`](../../src/Makefile.am) lists you can see that many libraries pull in files from outside their source directory. But generally when working with libraries, it is good to follow an establishing pattern like:\n+\n+  - `libbitcoin_node` code lives in `src/node/` in the `node::` namespace\n+  - `libbitcoin_wallet` code lives in `src/wallet/` in the `wallet::` namespace\n+  - `libbitcoin_ipc` code lives in `src/ipc/` in the `ipc::` namespace\n+  - `libbitcoin_util` code lives in `src/util/` in the `util::` namespace\n+  - `libbitcoin_consensus` code lives in `src/consensus/` in the `Consensus::` namespace\n+\n+## Dependencies\n+\n+- Libraries should generally be careful about what other libraries they depend on, and only reference symbols following the arrows shown in the dependency graph below:\n+\n+```mermaid\n+graph TD;",
