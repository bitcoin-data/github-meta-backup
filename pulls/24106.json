Imagine a user withdrawing funds from an exchange, specifying an bech32m address for a point not on the curve. With this policy, the entire transaction will be rejected, including any other addresses the other outputs of the transactions were trying to pay.\n\nIf we really want to push for this, I think far more is necessary:\n* Discuss a change like this on the mailinglist and with industry.\n* Start by rejecting such outputs in our address parser.\n* Get other address parsers (including open source libraries, and potential closed-source ones) to do the same.\n* Finally, decide to introduce a policy to actually mark these nonstandard, perhaps with a delay so other software can start doing this consistently.\n\nAnything else, I'm afraid, will hurt bech32m adoption even more, as reports of stuck withdrawals may cause organizations to choose to not adopt it at all.",

      "body": "This type of protection is something we've discussed many times in the past in various forms, and we've generally avoided adding footgun protections like this, with the reasoning being that the set of things that a transaction creator might do to burn funds is simply too great for this approach to make sense.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, there's an additional cost to these protections, which is that users participating in batch payment protocols (perhaps a coinjoin, or maybe an exchange withdrawal) can cause operational problems for others if transactions which would have been relayed in the past would no longer be relayed -- eg if one user supplies an address to a batched-output transaction process, and we then make such an address policy-invalid, then that might cause headaches for everyone else, as the resulting transaction relays less well and/or fails to be mined.  To avoid it, the transaction creator/process would need to be made aware of the new restriction, too. \r\n\r\nI think the principle we've settled on historically is that we'd like to standardize the set of checks that transaction creators might run on a given address to precisely the things that are defined in the various BIPs that define what a valid P2PKH, P2SH, or bech32(m) address is, so that there is certainty on the network around what addresses people can be using, and leave it to the users creating addresses to be creating valid ones.",

The current implementation of XOnlyPubkey actually fully decompresses the public key, which isn't necessary. A more optimized implementation (using code already available in libsecp, but not exposed through its API) could probably speed it up by a factor 2x-3x still.\r\n\r\nThat said, I still think this is a bad idea to introduce as a policy. It may make sense in address decoding though (just as a warning), but there performance isn't that critical.",

My initial assumption would be that exchanges are professional enough to know what they are doing and are able to fix such a potential problem quite quickly if it comes up (rather than going a step backwards and removing bech32m support completely), but probably that is too optimistic.\r\n\r\nWhat I think _can_ be easily done though is to at least warn the user in RPCs like `verifyaddress` etc. if the address output contains an invalid x-only pubkey. This is the first address type that can be verifiably unspendable (previously it was just hashes encoded), so the concept is new, but we could introduce an `unspendable` field in the result or similar.",

If the x-only pubkey is not on the curve, then there is verifiably no chance this output can ever be spent. I.e. the `unspendable` result flag would only be set if we are sure about it, without any sophisticated heuristics involved. (This does of course not mean that all outputs where the `unspendable` flag is not set, _are_ spendable; there is no way to guarantee that).\r\n\r\n",

However, all other witness programs, including v1 programs of sizes different than the taproot output size are treated standard (`WITNESS_UNKNOWN`). They should also be relayed, see #15846.\r\n\r\nFor those, it is impossible to run any checks because the meaning of the program payloads isn't known yet. However, as transactions with those outputs are standard today and are relayed, you may end up populating your address book with (let's say v2) addresses. This is by design, so that users of an exchange can start using a new witness version before the exchange updates its backend nodes to understand the new witness version. Once the exchange updates the backend to understand the new rules, they might find that some addresses or past payouts are unspendable. With \"heuristic\" I meant that even an exchange that always runs the latest software can not protect against this, as a user today might go ahead and request a payout to a witness program that they assume to be unspendable in the future, based on a draft of the next soft fork. Or to quote your words: \"(This does of course not mean that all outputs where the unspendable flag is not set, are spendable; there is no way to guarantee that).\"\r\n\r\n",
