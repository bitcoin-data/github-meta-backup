      "body": "@laanwj Thanks for reporting. The annotations for `CoinSelection` and two other functions were incorrect. That is now fixed.\r\n\r\nThe intention is that literally all `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED`/`LOCKS_EXCLUDED`:s added in this PR should follow either directly or indirectly from `AssertLockHeld(…)`/`AssertLockNotHeld(…)`:s already existing in the repo.\r\n\r\nConsider the case where function `A(…)` contains `AssertLockHeld(cs_foo)` (without\r\nfirst locking `cs_foo` in `A`), and that `B(…)` calls `A(…)` (without first locking `cs_main`):\r\n* It _directly_ follows that: `A(…)` should have an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_foo)` annotation.\r\n* It _indirectly_ follows that: `B(…)` should have an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_foo)` annotation.\r\n\r\nI'll run through all annotations again to verify that they all follow directly or indirectly from `AssertLockHeld(…)`/`AssertLockNotHeld(…)`:s.\r\n\r\nThese are the annotations added – let me know if something sticks out/looks weird:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Edit: List moved to PR description.

Would it be possible to get a 0.17.0 milestone for this PR?\r\n\r\nOf the locking PR:s this should be the best candidate for early merge. It contains only locking annotations for which we are already asserting using `AssertLockHeld(…)`. Since this PR doesn't change runtime behaviour (compile-time checks only) it should be low risk.\r\n\r\nHaving this PR merged would make the other locking assertions PR:s much smaller and easier to review since this PR contains the bulk of the assertions which the other PR:s contain too.\r\n\r\nKeeping this PR rebased is getting a bit time consuming, so let me know if I can do anything to facilitate merging :-)",
