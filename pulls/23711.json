Many people seem to support the idea of documenting our _current_ RBF policy as it stands today.\r\n\r\nAs the ancestor/descendant limit carve-out exemptions are very related to RBF, it seemed appropriate to group them with this PR.\r\n\r\nRelated to #22806 - it seems that these policies are the most confusing for people, or at least the most documentation-requested.",

The higher level might be nice as to describing what we want the policy to accomplish and then the concrete policy can be described separately.\r\n\r\nI like this framing: that we should (1) communicate our overall design philosophy in a resource for developers and (2) provide concrete/precise documentation of the code we're releasing to other devs/users.\r\n\r\n> Given mempool policy is directly consumed by downstream projects for a number of safety-critical operations, I believe its documentation correctness matters. I don't think we have, at least not yet (?), a consistent review process for the wiki.\r\n\r\nI agree with this. The high-level ideas fit well in the dev wiki (which we can all collaborate freely on) and the concrete documentation of our policy interface should be reviewed + packaged with the code.",

A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions.\n+\n+A transaction (\"replacement transaction\") may replace its directly conflicting\n+transactions and their in-mempool descendants (together, \"original transactions\") if, in addition to\n+passing all other consensus and policy rules, each of the following conditions are met:\n+\n+1. The directly conflicting transactions must all signal replaceability explicitly. A transaction is\n+   signaling replaceability if any of its inputs have an nSequence number less than (0xffffffff - 1).\n+\n+   *Rationale*: See [BIP125\n+   explanation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#motivation).\n+\n+2. The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if that input was included in\n+   one of the original transactions. An unconfirmed input spends an output from a\n+   currently-unconfirmed transaction.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: When RBF was originally implemented, the mempool did not keep track of\n+   ancestor scores yet. This rule was suggested as a temporary restriction.\n+\n+3. The replacement transaction must pay an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original\n+   transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Only requiring the replacement transaction to have a higher feerate could allow an\n+   attacker to bypass node minimum relay feerate requirements and cause the network to repeatedly\n+   relay slightly smaller replacement transactions without adding any more fees.\n+\n+4. The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the replacement transaction and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) must pay for the replacement transaction's bandwidth at or\n+   above the rate set by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay\n+   feerate is 1 satoshi/vB and the replacement transaction is 500 virtual bytes total, then the\n+   replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Prevent a DoS attack where an attacker causes the network to repeatedly relay\n+   transactions each paying a tiny additional amount in fees, e.g. just 1 satoshi.\n+\n+5. The number of original transactions must not exceed 100. More precisely, the sum of all\n+   directly conflicting transactions' descendant counts (number of transactions inclusive of itself\n+   and its descendants) must not exceed 100.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Prevent a DoS attack where an attacker is able to easily occupy and flush out\n+   significant portions of the node's mempool using replacements.",

A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions.\n+\n+A transaction (\"replacement transaction\") may replace its directly conflicting\n+transactions and their in-mempool descendants (together, \"original transactions\") if, in addition to\n+passing all other consensus and policy rules, each of the following conditions are met:\n+\n+1. The directly conflicting transactions must all signal replaceability explicitly. A transaction is\n+   signaling replaceability if any of its inputs have an nSequence number less than (0xffffffff - 1).\n+\n+   *Rationale*: See [BIP125\n+   explanation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#motivation).\n+\n+2. The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if that input was included in\n+   one of the original transactions. An unconfirmed input spends an output from a\n+   currently-unconfirmed transaction.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: When RBF was originally implemented, the mempool did not keep track of\n+   ancestor scores yet. This rule was suggested as a temporary restriction.\n+\n+3. The replacement transaction must pay an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original\n+   transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Only requiring the replacement transaction to have a higher feerate could allow an\n+   attacker to bypass node minimum relay feerate requirements and cause the network to repeatedly\n+   relay slightly smaller replacement transactions without adding any more fees.\n+\n+4. The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the replacement transaction and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) must pay for the replacement transaction's bandwidth at or\n+   above the rate set by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay\n+   feerate is 1 satoshi/vB and the replacement transaction is 500 virtual bytes total, then the\n+   replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Prevent a DoS attack where an attacker causes the network to repeatedly relay\n+   transactions each paying a tiny additional amount in fees, e.g. just 1 satoshi.\n+\n+5. The number of original transactions must not exceed 100. More precisely, the sum of all\n+   directly conflicting transactions' descendant counts (number of transactions inclusive of itself\n+   and its descendants) must not exceed 100.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Prevent a DoS attack where an attacker is able to easily occupy and flush out\n+   significant portions of the node's mempool using replacements.",

A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions.\n+\n+A transaction (\"replacement transaction\") may replace its directly conflicting transactions and\n+their in-mempool descendants (together, \"original transactions\") if, in addition to passing all\n+other consensus and policy rules, each of the following conditions are met:\n+\n+1. The directly conflicting transactions must all signal replaceability explicitly. A transaction is\n+   signaling replaceability if any of its inputs have an nSequence number less than (0xffffffff - 1).\n+\n+   *Rationale*: See [BIP125\n+   explanation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#motivation).\n+\n+2. The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if that input was included in\n+   one of the directly conflicting transactions. An unconfirmed input spends an output from a\n+   currently-unconfirmed transaction.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: When RBF was originally implemented, the mempool did not keep track of\n+   ancestor scores yet. This rule was suggested as a temporary restriction.\n+\n+3. The replacement transaction must pay an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original\n+   transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Only requiring the replacement transaction to have a higher feerate could allow an\n+   attacker to bypass node minimum relay feerate requirements and cause the network to repeatedly\n+   relay slightly smaller replacement transactions without adding any more fees.\n+\n+4. The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the replacement transaction and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) must pay for the replacement transaction's bandwidth at or\n+   above the rate set by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay\n+   feerate is 1 satoshi/vB and the replacement transaction is 500 virtual bytes total, then the\n+   replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Try to attempt DoS attacks where an attacker causes the network to repeatedly relay\n+   transactions each paying a tiny additional amount in fees, e.g. just 1 satoshi.\n+\n+5. The number of original transactions must not exceed 100. More precisely, the sum of all\n+   directly conflicting transactions' descendant counts (number of transactions inclusive of itself\n+   and its descendants) must not exceed 100.",

A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions.\n+\n+A transaction (\"replacement transaction\") may replace its directly conflicting transactions and\n+their in-mempool descendants (together, \"original transactions\") if, in addition to passing all\n+other consensus and policy rules, each of the following conditions are met:\n+\n+1. The directly conflicting transactions must all signal replaceability explicitly. A transaction is\n+   signaling replaceability if any of its inputs have an nSequence number less than (0xffffffff - 1).\n+\n+   *Rationale*: See [BIP125\n+   explanation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#motivation).\n+\n+2. The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if that input was included in\n+   one of the directly conflicting transactions. An unconfirmed input spends an output from a\n+   currently-unconfirmed transaction.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: When RBF was originally implemented, the mempool did not keep track of\n+   ancestor scores yet. This rule was suggested as a temporary restriction.\n+\n+3. The replacement transaction must pay an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original\n+   transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Only requiring the replacement transaction to have a higher feerate could allow an\n+   attacker to bypass node minimum relay feerate requirements and cause the network to repeatedly\n+   relay slightly smaller replacement transactions without adding any more fees.\n+\n+4. The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the replacement transaction and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) must pay for the replacement transaction's bandwidth at or\n+   above the rate set by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay\n+   feerate is 1 satoshi/vB and the replacement transaction is 500 virtual bytes total, then the\n+   replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Try to attempt DoS attacks where an attacker causes the network to repeatedly relay\n+   transactions each paying a tiny additional amount in fees, e.g. just 1 satoshi.\n+\n+5. The number of original transactions must not exceed 100. More precisely, the sum of all\n+   directly conflicting transactions' descendant counts (number of transactions inclusive of itself\n+   and its descendants) must not exceed 100.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Try to prevent DoS attacks where an attacker is able to easily occupy and flush out\n+   significant portions of the node's mempool using replacements with multiple directly conflicting\n+   transactions, each with large descendant sets.\n+\n+This set of rules is similar but distinct from BIP125.",

The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the replacement transaction and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) pays for the replacement transaction's bandwidth at or\n+   above the rate set by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay\n+   feerate is 1 satoshi/vB and the replacement transaction is 500 virtual bytes total, then the\n+   replacement pays a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Try to attempt DoS attacks where an attacker causes the network to repeatedly relay",

A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions.\n+\n+A transaction (\"replacement transaction\") may replace its directly conflicting transactions and\n+their in-mempool descendants (together, \"original transactions\") if, in addition to passing all\n+other consensus and policy rules, each of the following conditions are met:\n+\n+1.

The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if that input was included in\n+   one of the directly conflicting transactions. An unconfirmed input spends an output from a\n+   currently-unconfirmed transaction.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: When RBF was originally implemented, the mempool did not keep track of\n+   ancestor scores yet. This rule was suggested as a temporary restriction.\n+\n+3. The replacement transaction must pay an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original\n+   transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Only requiring the replacement transaction to have a higher feerate could allow an\n+   attacker to bypass node minimum relay feerate requirements and cause the network to repeatedly\n+   relay slightly smaller replacement transactions without adding any more fees.\n+\n+4.
