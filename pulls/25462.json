    "body": "This change avoids unnecessary calls to `Rewind`, `WriteBlock`, and `SetBestBlockIndex` if the pindex is an ancestor of m_best_block_index. As the commit message describes, this can happen if the sync thread is almost done catching up, the tip is updated, the sync thread catches up to the new tip and sets m_synced to true, then the BlockConnected event for the new tip comes through. This leads to `WriteBlock` being called twice for the tip (though if more than 1 block is connected, WriteBlock would be called twice for each of them). For the blockfilterindex, this means that the filter file will contain a duplicate entry. The other indices seem to handle this fine. Because the blockfilterindex is not corrupted and the occurrence might be unlikely, I wasn't sure if this was a valuable patch or not (though IMO current behavior is not \"correct\"), so looking for Concept ACK or NACK. I was able to test that the filter file stores a dupe entry by adding some small sleeps.",

      "body": "I think this is probably better behavior but I'm a little unsure about this. Technically even though there is a race condition at the end of sync in current code and it can connect the same blocks twice in a row, it will `Rewind()` before it connects them the second time, so there is not an actual bug here, just inefficient data storage, because the index does not check to see if old block data has been written before writing new block data.\r\n\r\nThis fix prevents duplicate block data from being written in that case, which should be a good thing. But it does not prevent duplicate data from being written in the general case (which maybe blockfilterindex could do internally if it wanted to) if there are multiple reorgs.\r\n\r\nPossible reasons not to make this change:\r\n\r\n- Maybe behavior is worse with invalidateblock / reconsiderblock block usage? I didn't check details of this but it seems like if best block is height 100, blocks 91-100 are invalidated, then blocks 91-95 were reconsidered, previously the index would rewind and sync to latest valid block 95, but now with this PR it would stay synced at invalid block 100. Even if this happens it seems fine, but I would want to think a little more about whether there are other side effects from this change and be explicit about what they are in PR description or release notes.\r\n\r\n- As mentioned #24230 avoids this problem by just avoiding the race condition between sync thread and validationinterface notifications which causes it. So I do think #24230 is a better long term fix. But still this PR could be a short term improvement",

I also didn't consider the multiple re-org case which this PR doesn't fix.\r\n\r\nYes, I think the index would just stay at the previous tip in case of `invalidateblock`, and I think that the RPC `gettxoutsetinfo` would keep on working correctly. However, this probably wouldn't go so well with the current save/load logic assumptions: With the coinstatsindex, the running muhash would stay at the old (now invalidated) tip. If you now stop the node, a locator corresponding to that old tip is saved. On next startup, we'd read that locator together with the muhash, call `FindForkInGlobalIndex()` and set the index' best block to the last valid block (before the invalidated one). So the muhash and the best block would be out of sync, and we'd probably throw an InitError [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0dd34773334c7f4db7b05df30ee61b011795b46d/src/index/coinstatsindex.cpp#L373).",
