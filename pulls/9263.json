It will be removed for 0.15 and we should clearly be communicating that.\r\n\r\nPrior arguments about whether priority was still in use analyzed the data in different ways.  I believe @luke-jr looked just to see if some transactions were sorted by priority and included earlier in the block as a result, and found this to be happening with what he considered some frequency, I think he said 6% in 2014.  I, on the other hand, looked at what percentage of transactions were included in the block at all that would not have been on a strict feerate sort and found this to be less than 1%.  This analysis is now a year old and happened before we removed the default 50k priority space.  I can't imagine it's more than a negligible number of transactions now.\r\n\r\nMore to the point.  There is no reason for the reference code base that everyone uses to support complicated logic that we don't believe to be of general benefit just because some very small minority wants the functionality.  It should be implemented with patches or helper programs that apply prioritisetransaction and the burden on creating and maintaining such functionality should be on those who want it.",

(getrawmempool will tell you what you have so far)",

How are you proposing they figure it out, with no visibility into transactions other than their own in the first place? Why can they not just ignore priority like full nodes?\r\n\r\nIn any case, any argument along those lines is not very pertinent to the question of providing code for it. The reference codebase should absolutely not be treated as a vehicle to try to force specific agendas and policies on the network.",

At the very least, noting what will actually be lost, which is essentially the mining of legitimate non-spam fee-less transactions, in addition to the existing lines, is important.\r\n\r\nI do think some people fail to note that the concept of priority in general helps discourage spam transactions since the fast reuse of coins results in lower priorities.  Reducing spam transactions is certainly a positive thing, and using blockprioritysize to let transactions with priority in above potential spam transactions, regardless of fee, is important.  Obviously not the most ideal solution, but it is something that is certainly helpful.\r\n\r\nAs a pool operator I find it incredibly valuable to have control over which transactions are mined by the pool.  Miners (and thus by extension, pools) are the ones inherently charged with protecting the blockchain from spam.  It is unfortunate that many miners tend to ignore this particular issue.\r\n\r\nAside from just the release notes changes, I don't see any valid reasoning for removing blockprioritysize at all, especially considering it is in use and does serve a purpose.  Having more options for miners to control what they're including in the chain is a good thing.  It definitely looks like it's pretty unobtrusive code to keep as well.",

      "body": "Thanks for your comments, @wizkid057. I do disagree on a number of points, though:\r\n\r\n* Priority, as it exists now, is useless merely by virtue of there not being any wallets that optimize for it. That does not mean it can't possibly return, or that policies can't change over time, but I do believe that long term, multiple distinct actually used policies on the network will converge to. Anything else essentially requires users to solve a complex optimization problem with hard to estimate parameters. If btc-days-destroyed-per-size is to be incorprated in selection strategy (and I agree that it is possibly a useful metric can protect against spam), I believe it should be integrated into a single metric, rather than being a separately filled area.\r\n\r\n* I agree that miners are allowed to choose their own selection criteria, but I do not believe they are on their own responsible for fighting abuse. They are participants in an ecosystem, but their existence is a necessity rather than a given (the only alternative has a fixed group of people with censorship rights). By introducing them into the system, we are replacing some traditional security assumptions with economic properties. Thus, long term, we should make sure that their interests are economically aligned with the rest of the network. If abuse protection includes a btc-days-destroyed-based metric, then we should work towards having that integrated in the consensus rules.\r\n\r\n* I believe the cost of this code is way higher than you think. My impression throughout the mining refactorings, segwit, and ancestor-based mining implementation, the presence of the priority code was a constant burden that significantly increased testing and review.\r\n\r\nI believe we will remove priority mining, so there is no point is not saying that. NACK.\r\n",

      "body": "@sipa Priority is not meant to be optimised for in the first place, and its usefulness has never depended on such optimisation.\r\n\r\nSpam filtering *cannot* be effectively done in consensus rules, since spam and filtering thereof is inherently an arms race. Perhaps BDD could be added as a factor in the rules, but that is a complicated process, and there is no reason for miners to act against the network's health (and therefore against their own interests long-term) in the meantime.\r\n\r\nMy impression of the cost of priority is quite different (IMO most of those costs were from the political attempts to remove it at each step, not from any actual maintenance). In any case, the alleged costs you describe are historical, and there is no reason to expect them to apply to the current code, which is observably cleanly isolated and easily maintained.\r\n\r\nI have refactored this PR to explicitly mention the removal of free transactions as distinct from a separate deprecation of priority and advisement that it may be removed in the future, but without a specific target. My proposal is to leave the code in place as-is so long as it isn't a burden, and if it seems like it might be, we can consider its removal (or more likely, movement to Knots) at that time. I hope this can be accepted as a reasonable compromise.",

      "body": "While I think there is no question priority as a concept in Bitcoin Core's mining and other code is going away, this doesn't mean you can't do it yourself. If you want to use it as an anti-spam metric, we have an API which allows you to manually prioritize or de-prioritize transactions, which could be easily automated in relatively simple Python scripts to re-implement priority (or any other metric you prefer). If you find this too burdensome, I'd encourage you to add RPC commands which give you easier access to the data you need.\n\nOn January 14, 2017 9:46:41 PM PST, Luke Dashjr <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n>@sipa Priority is not meant to be optimised for in the first place, and\n>its usefulness has never depended on such optimisation.\n>\n>Spam filtering *cannot* be effectively done in consensus rules, since\n>spam and filtering thereof is inherently an arms race.

However it's still NACK from me.\r\n\r\nI actually think we should reword it more strongly the other way and make it clear that priority (coin age) calculations and the ability to sort by it for mining are definitely being removed completely for 0.15.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr I've heard you repeat the argument repeatedly over the last couple of years that the small burden of maintaining this falls on you and you don't understand why anyone else complains.   This is false. The vast majority of code that touches priority over the last couple of years has been written or maintained by me with @sdaftuar coming in next.  \r\n\r\nIt's ridiculous to repeat this same set of arguments about whether we should remove priority every release cycle and its a big waste of developer time.  I think we all agreed to let priority stick around a little longer than we thought necessary in order to appease you.  But the clock on that has ticked out now.  \r\n\r\nI plan on creating a PR removing all priority code in the code base as soon as 0.14 has split and I will advocate for its merging so we can all finally move on.  We would be doing a disservice to any users which actually use or know about priority (if there are any) if we don't clearly announce this to them.   So please don't make it less clear that priority is going away.  It is.\r\n\r\n",
