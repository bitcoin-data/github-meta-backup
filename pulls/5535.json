Really it's ungrounded for another reason, they're already very unreliable because of the limiter.\n\nTo some extent not relaying and not mempooling a very low priority transaction is doing the user a favour because it's easier to get a conflict mined.\n\nACK.

That \"rate limited free transaction\" means: your transaction had a too low fee to be considered as a non-zero-fee one, so it is considered as a free one, but we've exceeded our throttler protection for such transactions. \"insufficient fee for low priority\" seems entirely wrong; more fee would make the priority irrelevant, the priority is not the problem, and the reason for rejection is rate limiting...\n",

      "body": "That's what this change does. Previously there was a rate limiter and size constraints only. You could post a low priority transaction and it'd hang around until it reached a high enough priority.\n\nThe idea here is that it gets a little bit closer to a size limited mempool. But you can still fill up memory by attaching a fee. 1 BTC buys you about 100mb of mempool space. Adding another special case for free transactions doesn't solve the root concern, it just forces a (small?) financial commitment to exploiting it. Given that the size of the mempool can be easily measured these days (it's in the rpc) it'd be nicer if it worked differently -  if (mempool_size > flags[-mempoollimit] && priority < lowest_priority_tx) { drop }\n\nFree transactions are already pretty useless because of the rate limiter and arbitrary amount of block space allocated to them, but ideally we'd be trying to slowly unify them rather than adding more ways they are special.\n",

The fact that it reached a few nodes would not help you if those nodes weren't miners since it's not like they'd send it again when rate limiters permitted it; worse-- it would hurt you, because any that did take the transaction would block your own retransmissions of the transaction through them to the peers behind them. \n\nYou can, of course, still continue to retransmit and the network will take the transaction once it has sufficient priority. The priority calculation is also deterministic, so you can make a much better estimate of where you stand with respect to that then guesses about a very small rate limititer on far away nodes. But even if you don't know; with that you wouldn't as much end up with your propagation thwarted when your immediate peers take it and it stops there.\n",

      "body": "I ran a little study over the transactions my node received in the last 6 weeks of 2014.   There were 14,600 transactions that would have been rejected by this code,  on average about 1 transaction every 5 minutes.  But maybe of greater concern, 126 of these transactions (or about 3 a day) were for over 1000 BTC.   Transactions for that much value had to depend on inputs in the mempool to not immediately pass the priority test.   It makes me think though that we should broadcast this change a little louder.  Its not really called out in the release notes  and its important for other users of the network whose transactions might now get stuck as some of the nodes have upgraded and some haven't, which will also make it hard to rebroadcast with a fee. \n",

It also doesn't address the relay / rate limiter capacity getting chewed up by very low priority transactions which will likely not confirm soon.\n\nI'm not sure why you're saying \"unanalyized\", I ran the code for 5 days with recording the transactions it rejected, and didn't see anything concerning, before ACKing above.  This is also software written almost a month ago.\n",

      "body": "Alex's analysis provides data which quantifies the amount of breakage.\n\nI think the reason my proposed fix may _seem_ less deterministic than this change, is that this change doesn't really address the underlying issue. For instance, can it be bypassed by just creating lots of free transactions that are all of sufficient priority to be mined in the next block? I think yes, so it's hard to have confidence it really fixes the problem, or actually as there is no quantification of the problem it's impossible to say either way. It may also interact oddly with changes made elsewhere, e.g. introducing new rules like the \"inputs are free\" rule could change the economics of bypassing this check.\n\nSo I feel it's much easier to have confidence in an actual test against the resource limit in question. It's much more direct and less likely to be subtly impacted by changes elsewhere. There can always be hard-coded minimums in place to let people with copies of the mempool make predictions about where in it they will fall.\n",

Both fees and priorities are cost; and because the existing ineffective protections (which are actually inconsistent with the public documentation about the behavior; see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees) are non-deterministic and result in stuck transactions. Testing against mempool size does not achieve that end: At best it just changes the resource being contended with for a different one (slots in the finite space) and it's more non-deterministic.\n\n(technically this change also implies a maximum size, though its not big enough to replace the functionality of actual size limit; I'd prefer though to commence with that limiting only after we are storing the mempool on disk in order to avoid pressure to make the limit problematically low)\n\n> There can always be hard-coded minimums in place\n\nSure, thats what this is.\n",
