    "body": "The \"data\" field without outputs was marked as \"required\" in the help docs when using bitcoin-cli. This field when left off worked as an intended optional OP_RETURN. closes #27828.\r\n\r\nMotivation: It is hard to understand that \"data\" is actually optional for commands like `createpsbt` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt`.\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

How would someone properly indicate the \"data\" is optional if not specifying it as optional? The parent output is required and some of it's children elements are optional.

      "body": "> Do you mean to say that the user can combine data and address entries? \r\n\r\nThe outputs array, `outputs []`, must contain at minimum either an obj containing `{\"address\" \"..\"}` or an obj containing `{\"data\": \"..\"}`. You can also specify both, but you must have at least one.\r\n\r\nI'm reading over this block of help text again. \r\n```\r\n(json array, required) The outputs (key-value pairs), where none of the keys are duplicated.\r\n                                      That is, each address can only appear once and there can only be one 'data' object.\r\n                                      For compatibility reasons, a dictionary, which holds the key-value pairs directly, is also\r\n                                      accepted as second parameter.\r\n```\r\n\r\njust using separate objs\r\n```json \r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"bc1address1\":\"0.01\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"bc1address2\":\"0.02\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"data\":\"ff00ff00ff\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nor...\r\nAlso note:\r\n`a dictionary, which holds the key-value pairs directly, is also accepted as second parameter.`\r\nI believe this is saying you can also do something like:\r\n```json \r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"bc1address1\":\"0.01\",\r\n        \"bc1address2\":\"0.02\",\r\n        \"data\":\"ff00ff00ff\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nI think this style is for compatibility reasons per docs, so I'm guessing it's preferred/future proof to break everything out into individual objects. Please correct me if I'm wrong!\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\n`\"Either {\\\"data\\\"} or {\\\"address\\\"}, are required, but specifying both is optional.\\n\"`\r\nSomething like this be better?:\r\n`\"At least one object containing the key \\\"data\\\" or \\\"address\\\" is required.\\n\"`",
