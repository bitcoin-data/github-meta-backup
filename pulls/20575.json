      "body": "> Concept ACK.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n> This feels very deja-vu.\r\n> Is it somehow possible to prevent these from being introduced? \r\n\r\nHeh, the deja-vu is understandable :)  You [asked](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9344#issuecomment-266971851) the same question (\"How can we avoid these from being introduced again?\") in a gmaxwell PR with _exactly_ the same title four years ago: #9344 (\"Do not run functions with necessary side-effects in assert()\") :D\r\n\r\nLuckily assertion side-effects can trivially be guarded against using liniting. Let me know if we want such a linter: I'd be happy to write one if we have a consensus Concept ACK on that.\r\n\r\n> How did you find them?\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon these when reading static analyzer logs in search for more severe issues. Static analysers typically flag assertions with side effects. See #18920 for instructions on how to analyze Bitcoin Core using Clang Static Analysis, `clang-tidy` and `cppcheck`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ CPPCHECK_VERSION=2.3\r\n$ curl -s https://codeload.github.com/danmar/cppcheck/tar.gz/${CPPCHECK_VERSION} | tar -zxf - --directory /tmp/\r\n$ (cd /tmp/cppcheck-${CPPCHECK_VERSION}/ && make CFGDIR=/tmp/cppcheck-${CPPCHECK_VERSION}/cfg/ > /dev/null)\r\n$ /tmp/cppcheck-${CPPCHECK_VERSION}/cppcheck \\\r\n    --enable=all \\\r\n    --language=c++ \\\r\n    --std=c++17 \\\r\n    -D__cplusplus \\\r\n    -DCLIENT_VERSION_BUILD \\\r\n    -DCLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE \\\r\n    -DCLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR \\\r\n    -DCLIENT_VERSION_MINOR \\\r\n    -DCLIENT_VERSION_REVISION \\\r\n    -DCOPYRIGHT_YEAR \\\r\n    -DDEBUG \\\r\n    -DHAVE_WORKING_BOOST_SLEEP_FOR \\\r\n    -I src/ \\\r\n    -q \\\r\n    $(git ls-files -- \"*.cpp\" \"*.h\" \":(exclude)src/leveldb/\" \":(exclude)src/secp256k1/\" \":(exclude)src/univalue/\") 2>&1 | \\\r\n    grep -A2 assertWithSideEffect\r\n\r\nsrc/bench/chacha_poly_aead.cpp:34:21: warning: Assert statement calls a function which may have desired side effects: 'Crypt'.

Let me know if we want such a linter: I'd be happy to write one if we have a consensus Concept ACK on that.\r\n\r\nMaybe—@sipa's find shows that at least a trivial linter could be easily confused.\r\n\r\n> An alternative (and shorter patch) would be to use Assert, whose expression is always evaluated, even if for some unexplainable reason NDEBUG is set.\r\n\r\nThis seems like the best long-term strategy to me. Move to our own assert function that is always evaluated, then forbid (using a trivial linter) use of built-in assert.\r\n\r\nCode review ACK 5021810650afc3073c2af6953ff046ad4d27a1fc",
