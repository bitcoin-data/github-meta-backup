At feerates lower than long_term_feerate this\r\nmeans that a waste of 0 may be a suboptimal solution and this causes the\r\nsearch to exit prematurely.\r\nOnly when the feerate is equal to the long_term_feerate would achieving\r\na waste of 0 indicate that we have achieved an optimal solution,\r\nbecause it would mean that the excess is 0. It seems unlikely\r\nthat this would ever occur outside of test cases, and even then we\r\nshould prefer solutions with more inputs over solutions with fewer\r\naccording to previous decisions—but solutions with more inputs are found\r\nlater in the branch exploration.\r\n\r\nThe \"optimization\" described in #18257 and implemented in #18262 is\r\ntherefore a premature exit on a suboptimal solution and should be reverted.",

At feerates lower than long_term_feerate this\nmeans that a waste of 0 may be a suboptimal solution and this causes the\nsearch to exit prematurely.\nOnly when the feerate is equal to the long_term_feerate would achieving\na waste of 0 indicate that we have achieved an optimal solution,\nbecause it would mean that the excess is 0. It seems unlikely\nthat this would ever occur outside of test cases, and even then we\nshould prefer solutions with more inputs over solutions with fewer\naccording to previous decisions—but solutions with more inputs are found\nlater in the branch exploration.\n\nThe \"optimization\" described in #18257 and implemented in #18262 is\ntherefore a premature exit on a suboptimal solution and should be reverted.",

      "body": "@yancyribbens: The code had an early exit when an input set happened to achieve a `waste` score of 0. Waste is calculated by comparing the current cost of spending inputs with a hypothetical long-term cost (and adding the cost of change or excess in the case of changeless solutions). Specifically, the input-component of the waste score is calculated from `input_weight × (feerate - longterm_feerate)`. As you can see, if the current feerate is lower than the long-term feerate, the waste score of inputs will be negative. (I [blogged about the waste metric](https://murch.one/posts/waste-metric/), if you want to read more.) By picking the input set that results in the lowest waste score, we automatically prefer spending _more_ and _heavier_ inputs at low feerates, and _fewer_ and _lighter_ inputs at high feerates. \r\n\r\nE.g. at 1 s/vB, we would prefer a solution with two P2PKH (2×148 B × (1 s/vB - 10 s/vB) = -2664 s) inputs over a solution with three P2WPKH inputs (3×68 vB × (1 s/vB - 10 s/vB) = -1836 s), and a solution with three P2WPKH inputs over a solution with two P2WPKH inputs (2×68 vB × (1 s/vB - 10 s/vB) = -1224 s). \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, at high feerates say 60 s/vB, we'll prefer a solution with one P2PKH input (148 B × (60 s/vB - 10 s/vB) = 7400 s) over one with three P2WPKH inputs (148 B < 3×68 vB), but prefer two P2WPKH inputs over one P2PKH input (2×68 vB < 148 B), and obviously one P2WPKH over a solution with two P2WPKH inputs.\r\n\r\nOver the course of many transactions, this causes our wallet to opportunistically use more and heavier UTXOs at low feerates, which reduces our overall transaction fees, while preventing runaway UTXO pool bloat as we have seen from strategies that always try to minimize the input set (e.g. largest first selection).\r\n\r\nSo, we don't want to maximize the UTXOs used, but we just want to prefer spending them at lower feerates when it is opportune. By starting with the biggest UTXOs, we'll find one solution as quick as possible, but the algorithm hypothetically enumerates all possible input set (except that we stop after trying 100,000 combinations). While the reverse sort order would also enumerate all, I would expect that it performs much worse to find the first solution. It would be like trying to fill a bucket with sand and rocks where we currently put the rocks first, then pour the sand, and then instead pour the sand first and then try to fit the big rocks: the smaller pieces are much more likely to fit a remaining gap.",

      "body": "@Xekyo thanks, I read your blog post.  I understand the strategy where when fees are cheap, keep adding utxos to the selection and if fees are expensive go for a minimal utxo selection set.  The thing that I think is confusing is the terminology, specifically \"negative waste\".  Personally, I think \"weight\" is a better word that we should be aiming to minimize.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n`selection_weight = current_waste + input_weight × (feerate - longterm_feerate)`\r\n\r\nWe therefore try to minimize the selection weight, and waste is always the excess (positive) amount.",

It's much easier to understand than trying to read the reference implementation.  \r\n\r\nIn your post you describe `weight` as:\r\n> weight: total weight of the input set\r\n\r\nWhich I think is a bit confusing since you're defining weight in terms of itself.  Reading the history of [weight](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units) it looks like it can also be called `vbytes` which to me helps make sense of what weight is (a measure of data size after some possible transform).\r\n\r\nI understand not wanting to overload the term \"weight\", however in terms of graph theory, I think \"weight\" is typical terminology used to describe the value assigned to an edge.  In the case of DFS, using graph terminology feels fitting.\r\n\r\nI think `waste_score` is better, or maybe even just `score`.  Terminology that helps describe the combination of `?=waste + vbytes` or `?=waste + weight` (preference of following an edge) would be helpful.  In hindsight I think `edge_weight = waste + vbytes * (feerate - longterm_feerate)` would be preferable.  `opportunity_cost` and `input_set_preference` are good as well I think.\r\n\r\n",

There are four terms referring to different expressions of transaction size in Bitcoin:\r\n- size (raw byte length):  \r\n  The actual amount of bytes necessary to transfer or store a transaction. The relevant metric in the context of the pre-segwit blocksize limit. \r\n- weight\r\n  The weight of a transaction with 1 weightunit per byte of witness data and 4 weightunits per byte of non-witness data. Used in the context of the post-segwit blockweight limit.\r\n- virtual size\r\n  Derived from weight by dividing by 4, to make it more human-comparable to values people were used to before segwit.\r\n- stripped size\r\n  The remaining size of a transaction after pruning the witness data. Relevant for non-segwit only, who don't process witness data and continue to enforce the blocksize limit.\r\n\r\nThe formula works out when using weight and the feerate is given in `sat/kWU`. If the feerate were given in `sat/kvB` as Bitcoin Core usually uses, one should use the vsize.\r\n\r\n> I think `edge_weight = waste + vbytes * (feerate - longterm_feerate)` would be preferable.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me what you're proposing here, given that `vbytes * (feerate - longterm_feerate)` is already a component of waste.

      "body": "As a follow-up to clarify perhaps: `weight` in the context of the waste score is not at all redefined. It's exactly the same “weight” as in the context of the block weight limit and transaction weight. I just clarify for the formula that only the weight of the inputs is relevant in the context. You could of course use the complete weight of the resulting transaction, but the weight of the transaction header and recipient outputs would be the same for all solutions and thus just shift all compared values by a fixed offset respective to comparing the weight of the inputs.",
