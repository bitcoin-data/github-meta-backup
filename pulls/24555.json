This option merely tells Bitcoin Core that it is running in such an environment that connecting to a `fc00::/8` address will result in connecting to the CJDNS network, not the IPv6 private network. Given a peer like `[fc12::34]:8333` Bitcoin Core cannot choose between CJDNS vs IPv6-private. I am not sure how to make this more explicit in the text above.\r\n\r\nThe `-cjdnsreachable` option helps Bitcoin Core do better address management. Like, if one of its local addresses is `fc00::/8` and `-cjdnsreachable` is set, then it may choose to gossip that address to others. Also, making it possible to distinguish whether an incoming connection from `fc00::/8` comes from the CJDNS network or from a IPv6-private one.",

All participants use addresses from\n+the `fc00::/8` network (reserved IPv6 range). Installation and configuration is\n+done outside of Bitcoin Core, similarly to a VPN (either in the host/OS or on\n+the network router).\n+\n+Compared to IPv4/IPv6, CJDNS provides end-to-end encryption and protects nodes\n+from traffic analysis and filtering.\n+\n+Used with Tor and I2P, CJDNS is a complementary option that can enhance network\n+redundancy and robustness for both the Bitcoin network and individual nodes.\n+\n+Each network has different characteristics. For instance, Tor is widely used but\n+somewhat centralized. I2P connections have a source address and I2P is slow.\n+CJDNS is fast but does not hide the sender and the recipient from intermediate\n+routers.\n+\n+## Installing CJDNS and connecting to the network\n+\n+To install and set up CJDNS, follow the instructions at\n+https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns#cjdns.\n+\n+Don't skip steps\n+[\"2.

You may also [launch it as an unprivileged\n+user](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/non-root-user.md) with\n+some additional setup.\n+\n+The network connection can be checked with `./tools/peerStats`.\n+\n+## Run Bitcoin Core with CJDNS\n+\n+Once you are connected to the CJDNS network, the following Bitcoin Core\n+configuration option makes CJDNS peers automatically reachable:\n+\n+```\n+-cjdnsreachable\n+```\n+\n+With this option enabled, if your node connects to `fc00::/8` addresses, they\n+will lead to the CJDNS network.
