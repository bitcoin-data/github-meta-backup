    "body": "_Submitting as draft pull request: seeking Concept ACK:s._\r\n\r\nTautological run-time checks may be an indication of incorrect logic. Enabling compiler warnings for tautological checks can help identify such issues early in the development cycle.\r\n\r\nIf it is clear already at compile-time that a run-time check is tautological it is better to make it a compile-time check using `static_assert` (if possible and assuming the check should be kept).\r\n\r\nCompile-time checking is preferred over run-time checking as noted in the developer notes:\r\n\r\n> `static_assert` is preferred over `assert` where possible. Generally; compile-time checking is preferred over run-time checking.\r\n\r\nSuggested changes in this PR:\r\n* Commit 1. Make compiler warn about tautological comparisons (`-Wtautological-constant-in-range-compare` in Clang)\r\n* Commit 2. Get rid of current warnings by replacing the run-time tautological comparisons with equivalent compile-time assertions (`static_assert`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCompiler output given `-Wtautological-constant-in-range-compare` before this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\nutil/strencodings.cpp:304:11: warning: result of comparison 'long long' >= -9223372036854775808 is always true [-Wtautological-type-limit-compare]\r\n        n >= std::numeric_limits<int64_t>::min() &&\r\n        ~ ^  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nutil/strencodings.cpp:305:11: warning: result of comparison 'long long' <= 9223372036854775807 is always true [-Wtautological-type-limit-compare]\r\n        n <= std::numeric_limits<int64_t>::max();\r\n        ~ ^  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nutil/strencodings.cpp:338:11: warning: result of comparison 'unsigned long long' <= 18446744073709551615 is always true [-Wtautological-type-limit-compare]\r\n        n <= std::numeric_limits<uint64_t>::max();\r\n        ~ ^  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\ncore_write.cpp:100:15: warning: result of comparison of 0 <= unsigned enum expression is always true [-Wtautological-unsigned-enum-zero-compare]\r\n        if (0 <= opcode && opcode <= OP_PUSHDATA4) {\r\n            ~ ^  ~~~~~~\r\nscript/script.h:449:20: warning: result of comparison of unsigned enum expression < 0 is always false [-Wtautological-unsigned-enum-zero-compare]\r\n        if (opcode < 0 || opcode > 0xff)\r\n            ~~~~~~ ^ ~\r\nscript/script.h:449:34: warning: result of comparison 'opcodetype' > 255 is always false [-Wtautological-type-limit-compare]\r\n        if (opcode < 0 || opcode > 0xff)\r\n                          ~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~\r\nscript/interpreter.cpp:343:28: warning: result of comparison of 0 <= unsigned enum expression is always true [-Wtautological-unsigned-enum-zero-compare]\r\n            if (fExec && 0 <= opcode && opcode <= OP_PUSHDATA4) {\r\n                         ~ ^  ~~~~~~\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompiler output given `-Wtautological-constant-in-range-compare` after this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\n$\r\n```",

The \"`sizeof(unsigned long long) > sizeof(uint64_t)` fix\" you're referring to in the current code does not look correct if the intention is that these functions should give identical results across platforms.\r\n\r\nMore specifically my reading is that input test cases can be constructed such that the output of these functions will differ depending on `sizeof(unsigned long long)`.\r\n\r\nIs that your reading too? Please correct me if I'm missing something: if so I apologise in advance.\r\n\r\nAssuming that this view is shared (regarding the platform dependence of `Parse{U,}Int64`), what is the better option when the first user decides to compile Bitcoin Core on a platform where `sizeof(unsigned long long) > sizeof(uint64_t)`:\r\n* a.). To give a compile-time error, or\r\n* b.). To compile happily and give the user a \"unique\" `Parse{U,}Int64` experience? :)",

      "body": "*The idea* is that `ParseUint64` rejects values outside the range of `uint64_t` as parse error. So `strtoull` could return values outside the range of `uint64_t`, but this will be treated as a parse error. \r\n\r\n- On platforms where `uint64_t` == `unsigned long long` this works, because, values outside `uint64_t` will be rejected by `strtoull`. The comparison is tautological.\r\n- On platforms where `uint64_t` < `unsigned long long`, this works, because `strtoull` will return the larger value, but the `n <= std::numeric_limits<uint64_t>::max()` check detects it is out of range and returns a parse error.\r\n\r\nIf you think this doesn't currently work, feel free to fix it. I'm, however, unwilling to add an unnecessary static assertion here.\r\n",
