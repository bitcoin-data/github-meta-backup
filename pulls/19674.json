    "body": "This tiny PR substitutes Python loops in the form of `for x in range(N): ...` by `for _ in range(N): ...` where applicable. The idea is indicating to the reader that a block (or statement, in list comprehensions) is just repeated N times, and that the loop counter is not used in the body, hence using the throwaway variable. This is already done quite often in the current tests (see e.g. `$ git grep \"for _ in range(\"`). Another alternative would be using `itertools.repeat` (according to Python core developer Raymond Hettinger it's [even faster](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1144527183341375488)), but that doesn't seem to be widespread in use and I'm not sure about a readability increase.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback I see is that whenever one wants to debug loop iterations, one would need to introduce a loop variable again. Reviewing this is basically a no-brainer, since tests would fail immediately if a a substitution has taken place on a loop where the variable is used.\r\n\r\nInstances to replace were found by `$ git grep \"for.*in range(\"` and manually checked.",

I'm really hesitant to review this without us trying to prevent it in the future.\r\n\r\nYes, I was thinking the same. My hope is that with the pattern being more widespread in the code, awareness for this raises and hence it is on the long term easier catched both by PR creators and by reviewers. Not sure if that's enough -- adding it as rule to the linter seems to be too strong though, agree with laanwj here.\r\n\r\nFor anyone wanting to try out the linters: note that (at least on my system) `pylint` is for linting Python 2 code, hence we should ensure to use `pylint3` here, which interestingly enough also detects a bit more. (Some systems may have a symlink from `pylint` to `pylint3`, but better check via `pylint --version`.)",
