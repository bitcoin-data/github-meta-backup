I figure a similar change may be desirable for the OpenRC and CentOS init files, but I don't have a way to test them and I'm not even exactly sure how environment variables should be added there (via export statements?).",

Increasing `dbcache` or `maxmempool` wouldn't create new threads, only increase a set limit of RAM usage, so I don't think those alone would trigger the behavior I was seeing.",
