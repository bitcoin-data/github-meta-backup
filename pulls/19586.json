Try `pip3 install pyupgrade && pyupgrade $(git ls-files -- \"*.py\") && git diff` to see the suggested changes.\r\n\r\n(Personally I don't have any strong opinion about this: just suggesting the proper tooling.)",

Try `pip3 install pyupgrade && pyupgrade $(git ls-files -- \"*.py\") && git diff` to see the suggested changes.\r\n> \r\n> (Personally I don't have any strong opinion about this: just suggesting the proper tooling.)\r\n\r\nI lowkey fear using automated tools on a big repo.
