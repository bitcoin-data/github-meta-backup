    "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender ---- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender ---- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",

I was thinking its probably ok to broadcast to a few peers, not just one. And if they blackhole it, then the code will retry. We can retry more aggressively if it keeps being blackholed. I think it is ok to assume that there are some honest nodes in our addrman.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps it is worth combining this with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213 and instead of one-shot connections we broadcast only to existing selected connections on these privacy networks.\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects of this:\r\n1. Linking a bitcoin transaction to IP address/geolocation. Broadcasting to long-lived Tor/I2P connections solves this (modulo other issues like linking Tor nodes with IP addresses).\r\n2. Linking one bitcoin transaction with another bitcoin transaction that otherwise are unrelated. To solve/mitigate this we need to send each transaction over its individual connection and that connection to not be linkable to other connections.\r\n\r\n> Not sure if this should be the default or an optional mode\r\n\r\nRight, also assuming there will be bugs/unexpected things - maybe have an option to enable/disable this. Hardest would be to introduce it without an option to disable it. Softest approach would be: 1. introduce under an option with default off, 2. in next version flip the default to on (if it seems to be working well)\r\n\r\n> It might also be helpful to combine this with some heuristics that the tx percolated through the network:\r\nFor example, require that 2 of your regular full outbound connections (that you didn't send it to ) have inv'ed the tx back to you - otherwise try again after some time.\r\n\r\nI actually changed the behavior to do something like that in 512077bb8805eacb671eabcf9d62463a2a6e6a39 `net_processing: relay local transactions via the SENSITIVE_RELAY mechanism` in this PR: see where `RemoveUnbroadcastTx()` was called before / is called now. Maybe that deserves a separate commit. Before we would be ok as long as we pushed the tx to the peer. Now we wait until we receive an `INV` about that tx from somebody. There is some room for improvement - added in the TODO in the OP.",

My main concern is about how to ensure the transaction has not been censored. It seems easy for an attacker to identify someone opened a connection just to relay its own transaction.\r\n\r\n> Now we wait until we receive an INV about that tx from somebody\r\n\r\nJust to clarify: We would open the short-lived connection to relay our own transaction and close it right after and then, we wait until we receive an INV about that tx from somebody, if not, we would try to do it (open a new short-lived conn...) all over again?",

But we may as well send to a few peers at the same time, then wait. And, I am not sure, maybe if it does not work for a long time, then fall back to the existent mechanism?\r\n\r\nThe worst that can happen is if our addrman is filled with malicious Tor peers that blackhole such initial announcements. But even if 90% of them are blackholes, then after a dozen attempts we should eventually send to a honest node which will propagate it to the network. Attempts are cheap and don't reveal any of the identity of the sender.\r\n",

      "body": "`>>` This is ready for review and testing `<<`\r\n\r\n> ... if the transaction is sent along with the potentially uniquely identifying UA comment, or other fingerprints in the version message. Maybe it makes sense to define a static version message ...\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke, I went with a [completely static `VERSION` message](https://github.com/vasild/bitcoin/blob/b73810f80917dd882d6161f6892f10f8c46a8193/src/net_processing.cpp#L1439-L1446)\r\n\r\n> ... Perhaps it's worth mimicking `bitcoin-submittx`\r\n\r\n@sipa, [done](https://github.com/vasild/bitcoin/blob/b73810f80917dd882d6161f6892f10f8c46a8193/src/net_processing.cpp#L1444)\r\n\r\n> Or it could randomize it, from the list of different version strings.\r\n\r\n@kristapsk, could be, but I did not do that (yet). I think a constant suffices and is the simplest thing to do.\r\n\r\n> Not sure if this should be the default or an optional mode\r\n\r\n@mzumsande, I made it optional, guarded by a new option `-sensitiverelayowntx` which is \"off\" by default. If all goes well, we can consider flipping the default to \"on\" after one release.\r\n\r\n> It might also be helpful to combine this with some heuristics that the tx percolated through the network: For example, require that 2 of your regular full outbound connections (that you didn't send it to ) have inv'ed the tx back to you - otherwise try again after some time.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense and is a room for improvement, let me summarize:\r\n\r\n* In `master` we consider the transaction percolated through the network after we push it to a peer (no wait for `INV` from somebody else).\r\n* In this PR, currently, we want for `INV` from somebody, ask for the full transaction with `GETDATA` and after we receive it, then consider it done.\r\n\r\nI am trying to strike a balance between simplicity (too simple and maybe it will break) and robustness (requires more complexity). Now, at the cost of more complexity we can require more:\r\n* an `INV` from more than one peer.\r\n* an `INV` from IPv4, IPv6 or CJDNS peer.\r\n* an `INV` from an outbound peer.\r\n\r\nWe have to start behaving normally after we get the first `INV`, which means to relay to all peers and include the transaction in `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` replies. Thus to achieve any of the above, it would be necessary to split the list of \"unbroadcast\" transactions in two:\r\n1. (now) transactions that we have to send via short-lived sensitive relay connections and we hide from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` and ask for the full transaction once we get `INV`\r\n2. (new list) transactions that we have to send via short-lived sensitive relay connections, but we have already received them via at least one `INV`, so include them in `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL`\r\n\r\n> If a spy is connected to each node, we might send the tx to them first currently (master), but with the PR, if we are now the only node that never inv's the tx to them at all (provided that all other nodes do that eventually with the flooding mechanism) that would equally identify us as the source.\r\n\r\n@mzumsande, I believe that is fixed now - once we get an `INV`, we will flood it to everybody and start behaving normally.\r\n\r\n> Might be good to have some way of being able to configure where to connect to for sensitive relay, defaulting to tor/i2p, but so that you could perhaps enable specific ipv4/ipv6 addresses as well, particularly for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n@ajtowns, sensitive relay via IPv4 seems like a way to shoot yourself in the foot. I extended the testing framework a bit to have a proper functional test for this.\r\n\r\n> ... if a spy is able to reliably fingerprint a node between networks, this mechanism could potentially degrade privacy ...\r\n\r\n@amitiuttarwar, no because the spy will not be able to relate the sensitive relay connection to another connection with the transaction originator on the same network.\r\n\r\n> The connection should be established after another tor/i2p connection is dropped - this way the connection appears to be just another connection - nothing special about it.\r\n> It may also be useful to randomize the duration of the connection?\r\n> Additionally - padding the connection with dummy txs during its lifecycle may help obfuscate the real payload?\r\n\r\n@RandyMcMillan, I am not sure why another connection should be dropped. I think adding more transactions in the broadcast is going to bring little value because they will be transactions that have already propageted through the network. A spy would be able to identify which one is the unbroadcast transaction. The point here is that even that the spy knows this is initial broadcast, they can't identify the sender and the worst they can do is blackhole the transaction.\r\n\r\n> > One shot connections + immediate tx broadcast without inv,getdata exchange leaks that the tx is likely being broadcast for the first time (easy to censor the tx as the receiver).\r\n\r\n> I agree. My main concern is about how to ensure the transaction has not been censored. It seems easy for an attacker to identify someone opened a connection just to relay its own transaction.\r\n\r\n@brunoerg, Yes, that should be ok.\r\n\r\n> Ideally, if outbound has clearnet connections, we would resume normal operation IFF one of those connections INV's it. This reduces risk of sybil influencing the node.\r\n\r\n@instagibbs, Yes, see a few lines above, we would need two lists of unbroadcast transactions.\r\n",

      "body": "@instagibbs added some more info to the OP, but feel free to reach on `#bitcoin-core-dev` to clarify things. Once a local transaction is is received, 5 such connections will be made right away. If we still consider the transaction unbroadcast after 10-15 mins, then it will be retried (5 new connections). These 10-15 mins are how `master` does things now but I think if sensitive relay is used this can be made more aggressive and/or increase the number of peers we broadcast to. E.g. after 3 minutes broadcast to 10 peers.\r\n\r\n> General question about this: what will be the impact on tor/i2p nodes? (Like, resources-wise for those operators) are there even enough hidden services nodes with inbound slots to support this?\r\n\r\n@pinheadmz, good question. Traffic-wise - the selected recipients will receive the transaction via a short-lived connection, but even now they do receive the transaction in one way or another. The overhead is the extra handshake of the new connection. Some quick tests show, from the point of view of the tx sender: sent 180 bytes (excluding the transaction itself), received 239 bytes.\r\n\r\nInbound slots-wise: Some [back of the envelope calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation):\r\n* The historical maximum for the Bitcoin network of incoming transactions has been about 10 new transactions per second, typically that is 3-4 tx/sec. Lets say `3..10` tx/sec.\r\n* Each new tx causes 5 new connections to be opened, so for one second `15..50` new connections will be opened in total in that second (`3*5..10*5`).\r\n* Lets say one short-lived connection takes `2..10` seconds. That is a moving window of `2..10` seconds.\r\n* In the next `2..10` seconds they will not be closed and so for `2..10` seconds `30..500` new connections will be opened (`2*15..10*50`).\r\n* The constant load of those `30..500` extra connections will be spread evenly amongst ~10k listening Tor or I2P nodes. So each listening Tor or I2P node will have to handle `0.003..0.05` more incoming connections.\r\n\r\n>  In a world where all TXs are broadcast to the network through \"exit nodes\" are there any other possible drawbacks ?\r\n\r\nBy \"exit nodes\" you mean the new sensitive relay mechanism and not Tor-to-IPv4 exit nodes, right? If the Tor or I2P network stops working then the Bitcoin nodes that are connected to it and have the sensitive relay enabled will not be able to broadcast their transactions. Maybe we should eventually fall back to the old relay mechanism after some time has passed in unsuccessful sensitive relay attempts.\r\n\r\nBut notice - as the author of this, I have a blind spot for its drawbacks!",

Inside `PeerManagerImpl::ScheduleLocalTxForRelay()` `UseSensitiveRelay()` would return `false` and `m_connman.ScheduleSensitiveRelayConnections()` which increments the counter will never be called.\r\n\r\nNow, that is the logic of some code far away, in another file. I did not want to rely on it because if we enter here and both are unreachable, then it will end up in an infinite loop. An assert that at least one is reachable is the other option, but I am trying to code this \"defensively\", following @sdaftuar's comment from another PR that excessive asserts in the networking code are better avoided.",

      "body": "TLDR: @instagibbs, right! :)\r\n\r\nFirst, the problem with the user-agent string is that it can be customized which will totally reveal the identity of the sender. Next idea is to use the non-customized user-agent even if `-uacomment=` is configured. But then, why even reveal the version - whether it is 26.0 or 27.0? Right after a new release there will be few nodes that run the just-released version and thus the anonymity set will be small. So this string better be constant - either empty string or whatever other constant. `/pynode:0.0.1/` was suggested here - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418",
