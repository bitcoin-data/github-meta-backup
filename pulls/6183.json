    "body": "Previously due to an off-by-one error the wallet ignored nLockTime-by-height transactions that would be valid in the next block even though they are accepted into the mempool. The transactions wouldn't show up until confirmed, nor would they be included in the unconfirmed balance. Similar to the mempool behavior fix in 665bdd3b, the wallet code was calling IsFinalTx() directly without taking into account the fact that doing so tells you if the transaction could have been mined in the _current_ block, rather than the next block.\n\nInstead of changing the wallet code, this commit simply changes the semantics of IsFinalTx() when the block height isn't provided to use the height of the next block. The resulting semantics return true if the transaction in question could included in the next block, significantly less confusing and more useful than the previous semantics.\n",

This is a consensus function independent of program state.\n- A function `IsFinalTxNow` that calls `IsFinalTx` with the default arguments (`chainActive.Height() + 1` and `GetAdjustedTime()`), to be used by the wallet and such.\n",

For consistency, it would be better to have the consensus version start with Check. But since this may be considered bikesheding, let me explain what the options I see. Let's imagine this in smaller commits that have been squashed and consider stopping at each point.\n\n1) Fix the bug without touching IsFinalTx, simply by appropriately  adapting the arguments in the pertinent calls (like the one in miner). We could simply stop here (or at any point).\n\n2) Separate a stateless (consensus-friendly) version of the function, like in #6063 .\n\n3) Every call to the old function that passes both arguments and passes them as non-null values, can be safely replaced with a call to the new function, great. You can go further and only leave the old calls that were using the default null values (triggering the replacement with the global state).\n\n4) Now we can safely remove the optional parameters from the old function, since nobody is using them (the calls that use the parameters now call to the new statelss function).\n\n5) Maybe we wanted to make the fix at this point instead of doing it first, since now you can fix it inside the stateless function and presumably less calls will be affected.\n\n6) Assuming we had chosen IsFinalTx for the old global-state-dependent function and CheckFinalTx for the new stateless version (as in #6063 ), we can now switch the names to gratuitously increase the total diff, make the stateless version name less consistent with other consensus functions names and complicate the rebase of branches that were already separating those functions (like #6051 and branches based on it) or that were touching changing IsFinalTx (like https://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/commits/seqno-cltv-csv).\n\nLet's please stop before 6. Let's forget about naming and making me and possibly other people work more. I propose to use a cleaner git history as the main criterion. My approach is better because it will produce a smaller total diff (since some calls that were using the default values can remain untouched). \n",

Importantly, by changing everything else we get it all onto a new function with guaranteed semantics of \"just figure out if this transaction is final according to whatever rules exist\" - exactly what you'd expect from a Check*() function!

I have to say that passing a CBlockIndex\\* from the beginning instead of using the global tip would make the function more stateless and my concerns with it being named CheckFinalTx would be lower, specially if it's going to be fully statelss later by not calling GetAdjustedTime().\nWhat about passing a CBlockIndex from the beginning? This will not increase the total diff either.\nMaybe also moving to from GetAdjustedTime to GetMedianTime in this PR. Tat would make CheckFinalTx stateless from the beginning: that would make me happy as well.\n\nSo, to reiterate and in summary: a function named CheckFinalTx should be as stateless as possible from the beginning: using the global activeTip inside it, even temporarily, seems horrendous to me.\nI now realize that there's more options than I was considering to make that happen.\n",

Even not forcing them to call GetAdjustedTime would be acceptable, but there's really no good reason to use chainActive inside a new function no matter how it is named. \n\n> Equally, we can't get rid of it after a soft-fork and replace it with some CheckFinalTx() or whatnot that takes block indexes, as the old behavior is still needed to verify old blocks.\n\nAs said I would be happy with both:\n\n1) Maintaining it as CheckFinalTx (new name because nw it's stateless) and maybe unify it with the new TestFinalTx in the future.\n\n2) If the new function is going to be stateless and named CheckFinalTx, we can maintain it as IsFinalTx or IsFinalTxOld or something.\n\nSo even assuming we want to have 2 separate functions for now, there's at least 2 options for getting a stateless (consensus-friendly) one named CheckFinalTx in this PR (so I would be happy to close #6063 and rebase #6051 on top of this).\n",
