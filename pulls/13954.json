Or so I understood it at least :-)\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9962#issuecomment-285332911:\r\n\r\n> In principle it is good to fix comment typos, but my preference too would be to either catch them at the source (review the PR and find them) so that they never get merged in the first place or bunch them up into something like a \"fix typos\" pull every few weeks.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9962#issuecomment-285334709:\r\n\r\n> […] This allows live cooperation on fixing typos without involving the maintainers at every step.\r\n\r\nAlso @fanquake requested an automated solution in #10419:\r\n\r\n> Im curious. What tool are you using to find these? I assume it's being run in some automated way on the repository when new changes are merged? Why not merge the open pull requests instead, catch the typos/incorrect includes etc etc and then advise changes in the PRs while they are still open?",
