      "body": "I don't like this change. It ignores the way struct and classes are used differently, and the reason `m_` and `g_` prefixes were introduced, which was to make it possible to distinguish local variable references from member variable and global variable references. For example with:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvar = 3;\r\nm_var = 3;\r\ng_var = 3;\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe prefixes help you see without looking things up that `var` is a local variable, `m_var` is a member variable and `g_var` is a global variable, and helps you read and navigate code more quickly.\r\n\r\nThe `m_` prefix doesn't serve a purpose for structs because because implicit `this` isn't used for struct accesses:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ns.var = 3;\r\np->var = 4;\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly with `s.var` or `p->var`, `var` is a struct member. Replacing it with `m_var` just adds noise.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to add code conventions when it solves problems, but it's not clear what problem would be solved by adding this convention.\r\n\r\n(Somewhat related: I wouldn't mind having conventions that help make the differences between classes and structs clear. I'd be happy with a convention that encouraged class member variables not to be public, so you'd be unlikely to see `c->m_var = 3`, and a convention that would encourage structs not to have methods and only have public members, so the structs would be used properly. I think we basically do follow these conventions so there may be little need to write them down.)",

Semantically it is clear, but is it really helpful to call a class with default public membership still a struct if you add member functions?\r\n\r\nIf there is no member functions (e.g. [CNodeStats](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a2a250c7d07bcb80cefca9dd4a7ce57f41291334/src/net.h#L614)), I tend to agree with hebasto and ryanofsky that the `m_` is pointless and doesn't add value in readability. If there is at least one member function (e.g. [CNodeState](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a2a250c7d07bcb80cefca9dd4a7ce57f41291334/src/net_processing.cpp#L276)), you have the implicit this pointer and it can make sense.\r\n\r\n> I wouldn't mind having conventions that help make the differences between classes and structs clear. I'd be happy with a convention that encouraged class member variables not to be public, so you'd be unlikely to see c->m_var = 3, and a convention that would encourage structs not to have methods and only have public members, so the structs would be used properly.\r\n\r\n+1",

There is a big difference between public data structures and classes with private state. Thousands of pages have been written about the wonders and magic of classes.
