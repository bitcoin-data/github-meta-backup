    "body": "This commit introduces IPv6 support (selectable at compile time),\n\nGeneral changes (even when IPv6 support is not compiled in):\n- Valid, routable IPv6 addresses are stored and forwarded\n- Name lookups are done using the general getaddrinfo() call\n- The detection system for the local address is improved. (addresses are classified according to their 'reachability', and the most reachable local address encountered is used).\n- The rule that no two connections to addresses within the same /16 should be attempted, was generalized by defining address groups:\n  - IPv4 addresses are grouped in /16 blocks\n  - IPv6 addresses are grouped in /32 blocks\n  - Tunneled IPv6 addresses use the encapsulated IPv4 address (teredo, 6to4, SIIT, well-known prefix)\n- Hostnames can be given using the \"[host]:port\" format.\n- Support for the \"checkorder\" message was removed (obsolete, and not worth porting)\n\nBehaviour changes when IPv6 support is enabled:\n- DNS lookups also return IPv6 matches\n- The listening socket is bound to the IPv6 ANY address (::/128) instead of the IPv4 ANY address (0.0.0.0)\n- Connections to non-IPv4 addresses are attempted, using IPv6 sockets (connections to IPv4 addresses still use IPv4 sockets)\n- A local IPv6 address is used instead of an IPv4 one if no routable IPv4 address is available. In this case, it is not advertized through IRC (obsolete).\n\nFor internal changes, see the commit message.\n\nPossible future improvements:\n- Some pruning/ageing of addr.dat \n- Cmdline/config options to modify IPv6 behaviour (eg. IPv6-only connection slots, preference for IPv6 connections, ...)\n- Intelligent choice of nodes to download initial chain from (avoid Teredo tunnels eg.)\n",

In this case, it is not\n  advertized through IRC (obsolete).\n\nInternal changes:\n* CAddress's \"ip\" and \"port\" fields are made private. To inspect them,\n  use GetSockAddrIPv4(), GetSockAddrIPv6() and GetPort().\n* CAddress's \"vchReserved\" field was removed, in favor of a full\n  16-byte \"ip\" field. The serialized format is unchanged.\n* The IsLocal() and IsRoutable() calls have been extended to\n  support IPv6 address classes (including documentation IP's, private\n  networks, auto configuration, and unique local addresses)\n* IP addresses are never passed as ints anymore, but as CAddresses.\n* No IRC nickname format is defined for IPv6 - IPv6 addresses are\n  expected to be propagated using DNS seeding and the P2P network.\n\nInspired by Luke Dashjr's earlier IPv6 patch.",

admins.\nJul 24 01:58:26 <jrmithdobbs>   i see.\nJul 24 01:58:40 <prof7bit>  during these few years i aged approximately 120 years.\nJul 24 01:58:51 <jrmithdobbs>   denisx: ?\nJul 24 01:58:56 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: um, nice strawman\nJul 24 01:58:59 <prof7bit>  at least this is how it felt\nJul 24 01:59:09 <Diablo-D3> how does a MS product help secure an all linux cluster?\nJul 24 01:59:10 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: no that was sarcasm\nJul 24 01:59:15 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: yours was the strawman\nJul 24 01:59:21 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: linux auths of MS's AD just fine.\nJul 24 01:59:26 <jrmithdobbs>   using kerberos.\nJul 24 01:59:28 <Diablo-D3> so MS AD runs on linux now?\nJul 24 01:59:36 <jrmithdobbs>   that wasn't a requirement\nJul 24 01:59:50 <Diablo-D3> all linux cluster implies even the auth server runs linux\nJul 24 01:59:55 <jrmithdobbs>   auth should be seperate from the cluster\nJul 24 02:00:03 <jrmithdobbs>   separate\nJul 24 02:00:07 <prof7bit>  it all boils down to how the user can understand it, everything else is almost meaningless.\nJul 24 02:00:13 \\*   freakazoid (~seanl@c-67-164-106-36.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined #bitcoin-dev\nJul 24 02:00:16 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: hows this, no windows in the damned building.\nJul 24 02:00:36 <jrmithdobbs>   hosted AD\nJul 24 02:00:41 <jrmithdobbs>   you suck at this game\nJul 24 02:00:44 <Diablo-D3> in the entire company\nJul 24 02:00:51 <jrmithdobbs>   3rd party contractor providing AD\nJul 24 02:00:57 <jrmithdobbs>   you suck at this game\nJul 24 02:01:03 <Diablo-D3> then I'd use openid and co over kerb.\nJul 24 02:01:19 <jrmithdobbs>   which destroys sso\nJul 24 02:01:52 <Diablo-D3> not at all\nJul 24 02:01:53 <denisx>    jrmithdobbs: never mind, I thought some of them are in the wrong order...\nJul 24 02:01:56 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: basically your argument is _you_ don't understand kerberos and _you_ can't implement, so it's too hard ;p\nJul 24 02:02:05 <Diablo-D3> openid and friends are the ultimate sso\nJul 24 02:02:13 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: no, I probably could WRITE a kerb impl\nJul 24 02:02:38 <lolwat`>   lolwut openid and krb are totally different\nJul 24 02:02:46 <jrmithdobbs>   denisx: gpgmail hasn't been updated for mail.app 5.0 so some of the indenting accidentally got lost when i signed stuff\nJul 24 02:02:54 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: openid doesn't provide sso\nJul 24 02:03:08 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: how could you impl kerb if you don't understand what sso is?\nJul 24 02:03:14 \\*   theorb (~theorb@91.84.53.6) has joined #bitcoin-dev\nJul 24 02:03:17 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: openid plus other things DO provide sso\nJul 24 02:03:24 <jrmithdobbs>   what other things?\nJul 24 02:03:49 <Diablo-D3> oauth, for example, if you need tokens.\nJul 24 02:03:57 <jrmithdobbs>   afaik with openid you have to resend creds for every auth request != sso\nJul 24 02:04:04 <sacarlson> how do you get listtransactions to provide more than the last 10 transactions?  count=15 returns [] , does mine have a bug?\nJul 24 02:04:06 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: no\nJul 24 02:04:11 <Diablo-D3> openid is a sign in once tech\nJul 24 02:04:31 <Diablo-D3> as long as your session exists, the sign in sticks\nJul 24 02:04:40 <jrmithdobbs>   oh so no session timeout enforced by the auth layer? sounds like a horrible replacement for krb\nJul 24 02:04:46 \\*   theorbtwo has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)\nJul 24 02:04:55 <jrmithdobbs>   and settable per session by the user\nJul 24 02:04:58 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: its used for websites often\nJul 24 02:05:05 \\*   theorb is now known as theorbtwo\nJul 24 02:05:12 <jrmithdobbs>   i know what oath/openid are, and they're awful imho\nJul 24 02:05:13 <Diablo-D3> now, yes, I do agree that web sign ons in general are screwy\nJul 24 02:05:24 <sacarlson> jrmithdobbs: you can add tokens in openid sessions that add timeout\nJul 24 02:05:35 <Diablo-D3> sacarlson: yeah, but the website has to kick you out first\nJul 24 02:05:52 <Diablo-D3> websites that use openid typically just plop a session cookie in your browser like normal\nJul 24 02:06:02 <Diablo-D3> the openid provider itself has no control there\nJul 24 02:06:11 <sipa>  devrandom: hmm, no incoming?\nJul 24 02:06:14 <sacarlson> Diablo-D3: everytime you update the page a new token is provided I think\nJul 24 02:06:19 <sipa>  devrandom: is that on xp or w7?\nJul 24 02:06:21 <jrmithdobbs>   sacarlson: not on most sites\nJul 24 02:06:21 <Diablo-D3> sacarlson: nope\nJul 24 02:06:32 <Diablo-D3> there are sites that do that, but it is NOT part of openid\nJul 24 02:06:33 <jrmithdobbs>   sacarlson: that could be done in theory but then you'd have to reauth on every page iirc\nJul 24 02:06:41 <sacarlson> jrmithdobbs: I\"ll have to double check mine then\nJul 24 02:06:45 <jrmithdobbs>   or cache creds\nJul 24 02:06:48 <jrmithdobbs>   which is worse\nJul 24 02:07:00 <Diablo-D3> websites typically just have a use once session cookie\nJul 24 02:07:05 <jrmithdobbs>   openid wishes it were kerberos basically, but it's not\nJul 24 02:07:14 <jrmithdobbs>   err oauth+openid\nJul 24 02:07:15 <Diablo-D3> when it expires, you have to log in again, or get a new session cookie that the site gave you\nJul 24 02:07:37 <cjdelisle> yea if it constantly changed the tabs -> fail\nJul 24 02:08:01 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: well, it depends how you define \"kerb usage\"\nJul 24 02:08:12 <Diablo-D3> most people using kerb simply arent using everything it can do\nJul 24 02:08:18 <Diablo-D3> and are using it purely for the sso backend\nJul 24 02:08:23 <jrmithdobbs>   true\nJul 24 02:08:42 <Diablo-D3> openid's only flaw imo is it requires an actual web browser (ie, its meant for web sites) to login\nJul 24 02:08:50 <jrmithdobbs>   but it can be used for everything from auth->sso->data channel encryption->identity verification of 3rd parties\nJul 24 02:08:52 <jrmithdobbs>   <3 kerberos\nJul 24 02:09:04 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: well, theres a small problem with that\nJul 24 02:09:15 <jrmithdobbs>   which is?\nJul 24 02:09:17 <Diablo-D3> data channel encryption IS handled in openid+oauth land\nJul 24 02:09:25 <jrmithdobbs>   out of band\nJul 24 02:09:32 <Diablo-D3> its a part of the stack, but not part of either of those specs\nJul 24 02:09:49 <Diablo-D3> identify verification can be done with oauth, btw\nJul 24 02:09:58 <Diablo-D3> actually, it can be done with SOME openid providers too\nJul 24 02:10:24 <jrmithdobbs>   ya that's the other problem with openid/oath is every provider is slightly different in spec-breaking ways ;p\nJul 24 02:10:26 <Diablo-D3> theres at least one that, for example, offer support for shit like finger print readers and crypto dongles\nJul 24 02:10:32 <Diablo-D3> not spec breaking\nJul 24 02:10:37 <Diablo-D3> they just offer more choices\nJul 24 02:10:55 <Diablo-D3> the website using openid doesnt NEED to know whats going on\nJul 24 02:11:04 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: google has actually, several times, changed user's ticket id or whatever that is their unique identifier\nJul 24 02:11:09 <jrmithdobbs>   not joking\nJul 24 02:11:25 <jrmithdobbs>   so if you only used google as a provider for some website you'd lose your account because your identifier changed\nJul 24 02:11:28 <jrmithdobbs>   lol\nJul 24 02:11:34 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: wtf\nJul 24 02:11:51 <BlueMatt>  damn, sudo via fingerprint swipe is sexy as hell\nJul 24 02:12:03 <sacarlson> Diablo-D3: you were correct my site doesn't change the token unless the session is broken it would appear\nJul 24 02:12:06 <Diablo-D3> bluematt: pam has fucking shit for everything\nJul 24 02:12:12 <BlueMatt>  no shit\nJul 24 02:12:15 <jrmithdobbs>   i really wish i was joking, because openid/oauth are better than _nothing_ (but not as good as kerberos)\nJul 24 02:12:27 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: wtf, that site is somewhat possibly broken\nJul 24 02:12:34 <Diablo-D3> I mean, wtf google and all\nJul 24 02:12:43 <Diablo-D3> but Im not using that id\nJul 24 02:12:46 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: no google is broken, other providers have done it too\nJul 24 02:12:57 \\*   underscor has quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)\nJul 24 02:13:09 <phantomcircuit>    tcatm, am i seriously going to have to use mod_rewrite just to name files trades.json\nJul 24 02:13:15 <Diablo-D3> what Im saying is, Im not using that for the internal id on my site\nJul 24 02:13:18 <BlueMatt>  now if only dmcrypt would decrypt via fingerprint scan...\nJul 24 02:13:25 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: was just an example\nJul 24 02:13:28 <phantomcircuit>    BlueMatt, you can do that\nJul 24 02:13:33 <phantomcircuit>    it's just silly insecure\nJul 24 02:13:40 <BlueMatt>  yea, I would think so\nJul 24 02:13:41 <Diablo-D3> bluematt: dmcrypt doesnt use pam for auth\nJul 24 02:13:50 <Diablo-D3> it'd be interesting as hell if it did, though\nJul 24 02:13:56 <phantomcircuit>    BlueMatt, sudo via fingerprint swipe is also insecure as hell\nJul 24 02:14:06 <BlueMatt>  Diablo-D3: I know, I was just wishing if it could use some kind of fingerprint scan hash for key\nJul 24 02:14:07 <jrmithdobbs>   i'm working on using OTP-ish stuff for dm_crypt key storage ;p\nJul 24 02:14:24 <phantomcircuit>    the fingerprint is stored as a hash of some data structure, but it only results in like 12 bits of entropy\nJul 24 02:14:27 <jrmithdobbs>   (technically it's challenge-response, but in a semi-onetime way)\nJul 24 02:14:28 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: still, the problem is this\nJul 24 02:14:31 <BlueMatt>  phantomcircuit: well yea, someone can grab a scan of your print from a glass or something...\nJul 24 02:14:35 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: I do _not_ want to deploy my own auth scheme\nJul 24 02:14:38 <BlueMatt>  phantomcircuit: thats it?\nJul 24 02:14:46 <phantomcircuit>    BlueMatt, no you can bruteforce it trivially\nJul 24 02:14:49 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: its easy to code, its easy to secure from the electronic side\nJul 24 02:14:52 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: internally?\nJul 24 02:14:54 <BlueMatt>  phantomcircuit: 2**12 sounds way too small\nJul 24 02:14:58 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: yeah\nJul 24 02:15:04 <jrmithdobbs>   why wouldn't you deploy your own auth scheme?\nJul 24 02:15:05 <phantomcircuit>    BlueMatt, lol it is\nJul 24 02:15:07 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: but its not actual authentication\nJul 24 02:15:11 <BlueMatt>  phantomcircuit: maybe that was some old model?\nJul 24 02:15:40 <prof7bit>  fingers can be hacked easily.\nJul 24 02:15:48 <jrmithdobbs>   BlueMatt: i don't trust biometric scanners, almost all of them have ended up having HORRIBLEY simple spoofing methods\nJul 24 02:15:51 <BlueMatt>  yea, they can get a print from something you touch...\nJul 24 02:15:55 <jrmithdobbs>   BlueMatt: at least, not as a lone factor\nJul 24 02:15:56 <phantomcircuit>    BlueMatt, my T61's builtin fingerprint swipe would result in a 64 bit \"hash\" of which the first 42 bits where trivially predicted\nJul 24 02:16:11 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: I can have them put an email in, and then even send a click me auth url to the email, it still doesnt tell me who the people really are\nJul 24 02:16:14 \\*   senseles (senseless@112.202.74.41) has joined #bitcoin-dev\nJul 24 02:16:18 <phantomcircuit>    not to mention that my fingerprints where all over the thing anyways lol\nJul 24 02:16:22 <BlueMatt>  phantomcircuit: damn...again though, maybe that was an old\n",
