I had this issue and spent much time on it.  I add clarifying notes to the documentation and a recommendation to use PyEnv, as **test/functional/README.md** recommends it.  \r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time on resolving my error `NoModuleFoundError No module named 'ds_store'` due to this, and adding these clarifying notes about it will help future developers avoid this situation.\r\n",
