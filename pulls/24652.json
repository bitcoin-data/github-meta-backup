It effectively uses the # tags to properly segregate subsections into logical units.\r\n2. Updates the example package versions to the latest one.\r\n3. Removes redundant information from wherever possible.\r\n4. Properly structure the documentation into a logical flow, from preparations to building specific wallet support.\r\n\r\nI want to suggest some minor changes that might help improve this documentation.\r\n\r\n1.

I had in mind to do this as well for a while.\r\n\r\n> I think we should not be giving version numbers in examples as this might incur a maintenance burden on the documentation as time passes.\r\n\r\nI agree in general. However not sure which version you're referring to exactly;\r\n\r\n- mentioning the OpenBSD version is pretty important; maybe not so much going forward, but there had to be significant changes for each release. So mentioning it gives some assurance that it's up to date, and the maintenance burden is there anyway.\r\n- automake/autoconf rarely have releases. It's some extra burden to track them, but on the other hand it's a lot easier to be able to copy/paste instead of having to check. Also, mentioning versions that work could be useful, there have been breaking changes to them for the BSDs in the past.",

It made the code snippet relatively brief, making it clear to understand.\r\n2.

Install Required Dependencies\n+Run the following as root to install the base dependencies for building.\n \n ```bash\n-pkg_add git gmake libevent libtool boost\n-pkg_add qt5 # (optional for enabling the GUI)\n-pkg_add autoconf # (select highest version, e.g. 2.69)\n+pkg_add bash git gmake libevent libtool boost\n+pkg_add autoconf # (select highest version, e.g. 2.71)\n pkg_add automake # (select highest version, e.g. 1.16)\n-pkg_add python # (select highest version, e.g. 3.8)\n-pkg_add bash\n+pkg_add python # (select highest version, e.g. 3.9)\n+```\n+\n+See [dependencies.md](dependencies.md) for a complete overview.\n \n+### 2. Clone Bitcoin Repo\n+Clone the Bitcoin Core repository to a directory. All build scripts and commands will run from this directory.\n+``` bash\n git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git\n ```\n \n-See [dependencies.md](dependencies.md) for a complete overview.\n+### 3. Install Optional Dependencies\n+\n+#### Wallet Dependencies\n+\n+It is not necessary to build wallet functionality to run either `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt`.\n+\n+###### Descriptor Wallet Support\n \n-**Important**: From OpenBSD 6.2 onwards a C++11-supporting clang compiler is\n-part of the base image, and while building it is necessary to make sure that\n-this compiler is used and not ancient g++ 4.2.1. This is done by appending\n-`CC=cc CXX=c++` to configuration commands. Mixing different compilers within\n-the same executable will result in errors.\n+`sqlite3` is required to support [descriptor wallets](descriptors.md).\n \n-### Building BerkeleyDB\n+``` bash\n+pkg_add install sqlite3\n+```\n \n-BerkeleyDB is only necessary for the wallet functionality. To skip this, pass\n-`--disable-wallet` to `./configure` and skip to the next section.\n+###### Legacy Wallet Support\n+BerkeleyDB is only required to support legacy wallets.\n \n It is recommended to use Berkeley DB 4.8. You cannot use the BerkeleyDB library\n-from ports, for the same reason as boost above (g++/libstd++ incompatibility).\n-If you have to build it yourself, you can use [the installation script included\n-in contrib/](/contrib/install_db4.sh) like so:\n+from ports.
