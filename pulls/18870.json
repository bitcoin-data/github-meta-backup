    "body": "As noted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18844#issuecomment-623004113, BDB versions 4.7 through 5.3 inclusive use the same database file format, so the wallet.dat files are compatible between these versions. The thing that is not compatible is the database transaction logs, but those are cleaned up on a clean wallet close. As such, allow people to build with those versions of BDB without needing to pass `--with-incompatible-bdb`. The docs have been updated to reflect this change. They now no longer mention that BDB 4.8 is required. The caveat about the transaction logs is mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis does not change the version of BDB used in the depends system, so we will still ship with BDB 4.8.\r\n\r\nThe search order for BDB was also changed to prefer system BDB and newer versions of BDB in general.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nOne issue I noticed while testing this was that it configure would pick up my system BDB instead of the depends BDB. It's possible that this could effect gitian builds, which would be a bug. Someone more familiar with our build system should check that.",

That's not in your whitelist, but it did work previously.\r\n\r\nWhen both `berkeley-db@4` and  `berkeley-db` are present, it prefers the older version. That is the behavior on master as well. In any case, it's fine, because nobody installs `berkeley-db@4` just for the fun of it.\r\n\r\nBut when only `berkeley-db` is present I can no longer build (unless I use `depends`). Previously `./configure` would fail and tell you to run with `--with-incompatible-bdb`. That would compile with some warnings, and version 18 indeed isn' backwards compatible (`Wallet file verification failed: wallet.dat corrupt, salvage failed (-4)`). But it works.\r\n\r\nWe still need to keep `--with-incompatible-bdb` around for these newer versions. If some lawyer doesn't like it, well...",

It's possible that this could effect gitian builds, which would be a bug. Someone more familiar with our build system should check that.\r\n\r\nTook this up in #18915\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18870#issuecomment-625833935\r\n\r\n> We still need to keep `--with-incompatible-bdb` around for these newer versions.

It seems like there's a real aversion to having to type `--with-incompatible-bdb`, and if your bdb system version is 5.3 instead of 4.8, then you no longer have to type `--with-incompatible-bdb`, and so hurray for this PR.\r\n\r\nBut if next year your system drops 5.3 and goes to 6, then aren't you back in the same boat again? If the real goal of this PR is to get rid of the `--with-incompatible-bdb` option and dreaded \"Found Berkeley DB other than 4.8, required for portable wallets\" error, then it seems like there are other ways to do this. Like replace the `--with-incompatible-bdb` configure option with a `with_incompatible_bdb` bitcoin.conf setting. Or in >4.8 bdb builds of bitcoin, don't create empty wallets by default, and ask for a GUI confirmation or confirmational RPC arguments when creating a wallet or loading one for the first time.",

      "body": "Am I perhaps the only person who never uses `--with-incompatible-bdb`? My limited data set of experiences with this, is that people stumble across the compatibility thing on first install, and then either go with passing that flag or they use the 4.8 install script in /contrib, which I finds works well and is quick, reliable and convenient.\r\n\r\nI went with v4.8 on first install to be on the safe side... After that I added bash aliases shortcuts for the various flags and builds, and have been using them since. Perhaps that isn't an optimal way to build? For now I don't think I'd find using other versions of BDB to be more convenient. With or without the flag, it changes little for me anyway once it's abstracted away to aliases. So I see this PR as mainly of use for first-time installers and am likely a minority in that view.",

      "body": "> AGPL isn't like most open source licenses (which only restrict distribution). AGPL restricts end users too. Running Bitcoin Core compiled with bdb 6 would automatically be infringing on the bdb 6 license. To legally run this combination, you would need to modify Core to advertise and share its own code to peers.\r\n\r\nThat is insane. But we already enable this with `--with-incompatible-bdb`.\r\n\r\n> Am I perhaps the only person who never uses `--with-incompatible-bdb`? \r\n\r\nI used to use that option a lot on macOS, because the `berkeley-db@4` package wasn't always reliable (#15819, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14327#issuecomment-425389533), and I have no need to open wallets in an older version.\r\n\r\nI'm also a bit paranoid about ancient versions of libraries that are maintained for the sole purpose of Bitcoin Core users. Maybe others have the same licensing concerns, but why wouldn't they use BDB 5?\r\n\r\nI never tried the the 4.8 install script in `/contrib`. macOS updates are famous for breaking stuff, so the more install options and supported versions, the better.\r\n\r\nThe default version used by Homebrew is 18 from Oracle, see this comment: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/berkeley-db.rb#L4\r\n\r\nSo I suppose there's good reasons to encourage users to stick to the old versions, but we shouldn't force them.",

      "body": "Concept ACK. \r\n\r\nI'm really liking this idea as there's a lot of *nix distros with repository versions in this range that aren't exactly 4.8. If someone tries to make wallet backups with the same version but switches distros or distro versions, this will make it a bit easier on them as far as not needing to build a specific BDB. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think we need to be extra careful because it's possible that while the format is the same between versions, there could be other minor caveats in the BDB code that screw this compatibility up some how. The format is the same, but is the data handled exactly the same by BDB? I'm more curious about this.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should only succeed if they have one of the major versions that are common in repos, rather than any version. (or maybe it's already this way, but it's not clear to me)",

Is there a clear error aborting the wallet load and saying there's a version discrepancy? Or is the wallet allowed to load with incomplete data? If it's the first, then this PR seems good. If it's the second, then allowing a case of data loss to avoid the need to type `--with-incompatible-bdb` doesn't seem like a too appealing tradeoff.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to think about (I don't this is a big concern if error handling above is adequate) is that \"these log files are only relevant in unclean wallet closes\" happens to be true right now. But it wasn't always true in previous releases, and it may not be true again in the future if we want to do something to improve large wallet performance without sacrificing data integrity.\r\n\r\nBut my main question is just whether there's an error or data loss a when 4.8 wallet software tries to open a wallet with 5.3 logs",

Would change to \"If not cleanly closed, then builds with the newer versions of BerkeleyDB will recover using all available log data, but builds with older versions of BerkeleyDB will open the wallet potentially not using all of the recovery data.\"\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18870#discussion_r421604853\r\n\r\n> > Or is the wallet allowed to load with incomplete data?\r\n> \r\n> The wallet is allowed to load. The logs are moved to a backup directory and an error is logged to both the debug.log and db.log. Unless the user is actively monitoring one of those files, they wouldn't know that there is an error and potential data loss.\r\n\r\nOuch. With or without this PR, it seems like dangerous to just throw away logs from future versions like that. I think separately we should implement a fix to prevent this type of data loss, even it is something really cheesy like writing a `wallet.db.ver` file each time we load a wallet with the current Berkeley DB version number, and refusing to load any wallet when (1) `wallet.db.ver` is present and (2) leftover `database/log.??????????` files are present and (3) `wallet.db.ver` is greater than the current berkeley db version. Error message for refusing to load could be something like \"Wallet [name] not shut down cleanly, and was last loaded using a newer version of Berkeley DB. Wallet software built with Berkeley DB version [version] or later is required to recover this wallet.\"\r\n\r\nAll of this makes me less enthusiastic than other reviewers are about this PR. Simplifying the build a little vs creating a new scenario for data loss does not seem like an appealing tradeoff to me, especially when we may want to rely on logs more in the future to deal with wallet performance problems like #18886 / #18904. But it's not a crazy tradeoff and people do love simple build steps, so there's that.",

That idea seems simpler and better than my suggestion if it works and doesn't cause headaches for users needing to do manual recoveries. If it does cause headaches, something like the  `wallet.db.ver ` idea could always be added later to restore automatic recovery when there isn't a risk from version mismatch",
