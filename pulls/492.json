    "body": "This change skips ECDSA signature verification for transactions during the initial block-chain download, which makes downloading the block chain much faster.\n\n\"Initial block chain download\" is all blocks up to 120 blocks before the last blockchain lock-in point.\n\nReasoning for why this is safe:\n\nIf an attacker tries to feed a client bad transactions during the initial block-chain download (transactions with invalid signatures), then they change the merkle tree, and at the first blockchain lock-in the bad chain will be rejected.\n\nTransactions are still checked for orphan blocks that come in during initial block-chain-download (ConnectInputs will be called with fBlock=FALSE) and for mined blocks (ConnectInputs called with fMiner=TRUE).\n",

Perhaps I could use this to pollute your wallet.dat with megabytes of junk transactions?   I suppose I could still do this without this change though.\n\nPerhaps it should validate up to block 75k or so, there are so few transactions that this shouldn't change the speed much but by then the difficulty starts getting high enough to make mining insane blocks just for disruptive purposes less attractive.\n\nI like that the stopping points is 120 blocks before the last lock-in, this seems prudent.\n\nIt might be prudent to rig the RPC/UI to never show anything as confirmed until the client reaches the last checkpoint.  I can imagine an attack where I can somehow trigger a remote node to flush and rebuild its blockchain, and then sneak some crap transactions past it while its between checkpoints. Though I admit the attack there is a bit far out and this really would make bitcoin no more vulnerable to it.\n",

This change doesn't make that attack any easier to mount. By far the bottleneck to that attack would be generating bogus blocks with valid proof-of-work, and if you were doing that they'd have only a single coinbase transaction which doesn't have a signature to check in it anyway.\n\nRE: rigging the RPC/UI to show everything as unconfirmed until initial download is complete: good idea, but as you say this proposed change doesn't affect that.\n",

Of course, he can already do this by changing the source code, so there may not be a real reason for my dislike for it. However, maybe we can still have a configuration option \"Verify entire chain\", for paranoid people?\n\nOn the other hand, if we are going to trust the locked-in chain data in the client anyway, why not do it for each and every block? There is not even a need for storing the complete hash of each block. For example, one could argue that 72-bit security is enough for blocks (would require 10 years to break with the current network power). In that case, store for each block the lower 9-N bytes of the hash, where N is the number of zero bytes at the front implied by its difficulty. The entire current chain would require 617725 bytes, in that case.\n",

      "body": "1) There is a subtle difference: currently the maintainer can prevent certain chains from being accepted by clients, but the accepted chain does need to be valid. If you're going to skip verification of everything beneath a certain checkpoint, an \"evil maintainer\" could make \"his\" client accept a fake chain. Again, I realize there is little difference with the maintainer just changing the code, so this argument is probably meaningless.\n\n2) Verification in a separate tool: I like that idea, actually, as it also allows detection of corruption of the database afterwards.\n\n3) Sure, after downloading it has the entire chain. I guess it wasn't entirely clear, but I was talking about a 600 kB file that would be shipped with/inside the binary. That would suffice to lock each and every block, instead of just a few checkpoints.\n",

Having a GB+ requirement is fairly undesirable (esp for mobile). \n\nI don't remember who, but someone brought up an interesting idea at the conference (poss. Gavin?). It would be an opt-in system for running a wallet, with optional trusted centralized verification. I'm not sure what that entailed but I envisioned the following:\n\nI could run bitcoin with -server, which would download the blockchain like  the current system. I could then connect to that node to verify my transactions from another bitcoin client (where I wouldn't have to download the chain).\n\nDoes anyone know if someone is working on this, and/or if it's viable? So far, it's the cleverest solution to the download woes IMO.\n\nI'm also wondering if this is possible with dropbox?\n\nI have also read a little about the headers-only version, I can't find a reference to how it's used - so I'm assuming it isn't fully implemented yet.\n",
