It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (you can find the patches applied at test-time at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/files/patches/)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.\n",

When deciding whether to accept a transaction as a replacement, increase this number and then check whether its fee is enough for that size. That's certainly overkill, as it will correctly count network and processing overhead, but not blockchain or UTXO burdening (as those only happen after finalizing). In any case, it's easy to implement, seems safe to me, and would at least allow experimenting with this on testnet.\n",

      "body": "As one relay anti-DOS mechanism, the minimum increase in fee to replace an existing mempool transaction could be set to minrelayfee.\n\nThis would mean a languishing zero fee transaction could only be replaced if it's total fee was increased to at least 0.0001 (or 0.0001 per KB). The replacement transaction could only be again replaced if all _its_ previous ins/outs are unchanged and the total fee is increased by at least another 0.0001 more. The resending client must also ensure that besides this resend increase, the priority-required fee is also added or increased if the transaction gains a KB or drops out of free priority, and the relay node enforces this correctly.\n\nThis gives the ability to increase pending transaction fees, but makes continued replacement not get beyond relays without spending more each time (and using up unspents). This also would discourage adding new non-change payment outputs to an existing transaction instead of creating a new transaction.\n\nAlso at the relay level, replacements should be bounced if existing ins/outs are altered, so 0-conf transactions are still as trustable as before:\n![modtransaction](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1425520/386166/452ef3c8-a69f-11e2-9628-18f65e4cffd9.png)\n",

      "body": "Please, let's keep it on topic.\n\nAs long as it is about a proof-of-concept DoS protection mechanism as long as this in testnet-only, I see no problem discussing it here. Before enabling it on the main network we can have a broader discussion, but that shouldn't prevent experimenting with the technical infrastructure for transaction replacement first. \n\nThe easiest solution is certainly requiring that every replacement adds MIN_FEE. I think that's overkill, but it should work. It means you have to keep enough change around for all times you may need to replace, and forgetting this would in practice result in your non-final transaction not being replaceable. So what I suggest is requiring that every replaced version pays for its size and the size of all its previous versions together, using whatever the fee policy is at that time. You can pay the fee once in advance, or increase it along the way if needed. This is still trivial to implement, IMHO, and one only pays for replacements effectively broadcast on the network.\n\nEDIT: Even better, you can retain this \"summed seen size\" of transaction versions, and use it in priority calculations when constructing blocks. This gives you an automatic prioritization for block inclusion based on the load you've caused to the network.\n",

The cost/benefit tradeoff there feels right. But as Jeff says, it's something reasonable people can disagree on, neither position is obviously the best.\n",

At least tx-replacement example should be implemented, but ideally a few use-cases.\n\n@mikehearn you could have easily done that on a single machine with a modified bitcoind and determined if a fix is or is not possible, and what changes (if any) need to be done with tx replacement without wasting everyones' time.\n\nOf course, I too am guilty of advocating stuff without writing any code...\n",
