A real manpage is a piece of free-form prose, describing the utility in all detail; that's not something you put into a help() printf. Which is precisely what I want to change: have a proper manpage - the one and only place where the thing is documented. As expected.\r\n\r\nHow do you learn the details of ls(1)? Exactly.",

I like your prose, I think it would be welcome in a printf, and C++11 supports multiline (\"raw\") strings that can contain as much text as you want to write. I guess your preferred solution to the problem of manpages duplicating source documentation is to remove the documentation from the source code. I think that would be reasonable as long as there's some kind of tool that can take the manpage and generate -help strings or whatever documentation we might need for platforms like windows where manpages are not the \"one and only place\" for documentation to exist.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't know if you proposed a solution for deduping the options documentation between the `bitcoind.1` and `bitcoin-qt.1` manpages, because we don't want to have to maintain two copies of that either. Maybe you could add a new `bitcoind.conf` manpage that the other two manpages would reference.",
