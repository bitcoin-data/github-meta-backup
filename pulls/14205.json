It provides unique code analysis to detect bugs and focuses on detecting undefined behaviour and dangerous coding constructs. The goal is to detect only real errors in the code (i.e. have very few false positives).\r\n>\r\n>[...]\r\n>\r\n>CVEs that was found using Cppcheck:\r\n> - CVE-2017-1000249 : file : stack based buffer overflow<br>This was found by Thomas Jarosch using Cppcheck. The cause is a mistake in a condition.\r\n> - CVE-2013-6462 : 23 year old stack overflow in X.org that was found with Cppcheck.\r\n> CVE-2012-1147 : readfilemap.c in expat before 2.1.0 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (file descriptor consumption) via a large number of crafted XML files..\r\n> \r\n> These CVEs are shown when you google \"cppcheck CVE\". Feel free to compare the search results with other static analysis tools.\r\n> \r\n> Security experts recommend that static analysis is used. And using several tools is the best approach from a security perspective.\r\n\r\nOther tools like `clang-tidy` can cleary identify issues like `NULL` vs `nullptr` (which I do not consider just a stylistic issue due to type safety), but in a more straight forward way then a bunch of possibly fragile handcrafted scripts. They can be configured just like the existing `shellscript` checker to only check for certain conditions.",
