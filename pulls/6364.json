    "body": "# Summary\n\n@gavinandresen reported a Tor-based DoS against one of his nodes a few days ago. He found his node had run out of connection slots and his peers were almost all Tor exits, additionally, his node had stopped following the block chain (likely an inv/getdata exploit but not known for sure).\n\nThere are other patches tackling the inv/getdata issue. This patch tackles the other problem, of a jammed node using all its resources to accept connections from a DoS attacker. It lays the foundation for a resource scheduling approach to handling DoS attacks, which runs in parallel to the existing blacklist-on-badness approach.\n# Approach\n\nA notion of IP groups is introduced. An IP group is a logically related set of subnets with a name and a score. The score of an ungrouped IP is zero. When a node reaches nMaxConnections, the IP of a newly accepted connection is checked against the groups and its priority thus calculated. If the priority is higher than an existing connection, that connection is dropped to make room for the new connection. If it is equal or lower then the existing behaviour of rejecting the new connection is used.\n\nNext, a list of Tor exits is compiled into the binary (a later patch could make the download dynamic, or overridable with a local file). Tor exits get a score of -10 by default, reflecting their tendency to be used for attacks. Thus if a peer is connected to by lots of Tor exits, those connections will be serviced, but clearnet clients will take priority and if need be, kick out one of the Tor connections to make room. \n\nThis behaviour is much preferable to the more obvious solution of requiring node operators to manually ban all Tor exits during the type of attack Gavin witnessed.\n# Future evolution\n\nThis patch creates a base that can be evolved in future. For example, the protocol could allow peers to effectively 'buy' priority by proving ownership of coin age. This would allow e.g. an SPV wallet connecting via Tor to take priority over a DoS attack from the clearnet, thus inverting things. However such a protocol is not in this patch.\n\nSmaller improvements might be:\n1. Allow loading of IP groups from a file, so people witnessing a jamming attack from other netblocks can easily de-prioritise them.\n2. Refresh the Tor exits list from https://check.torproject.org/ from time to time.\n3. Queue transactions and signature checks according to peer priority, to fix the \"ban every Tor exit by sending bad signatures\" attack.\n4. Boost the priority for peers that engage in useful behaviour, like relaying valid blocks and transactions (possibly only with an open port?).\n5. Slowly lower the priority for connections that seem to be idle. Thus new connections would kick out long term idle connections. This is more a solution to temporary organic load spikes than DoS attacks because of course this rule would be trivially gamed by an attacker who just disconnects and reconnects every so often.\n",

      "body": "@jonasschnelli asked the following questions on the original commit:\n\n> What if an attacker uses Tor Bridges?\n\nIt makes no difference, traffic that enters Tor via a bridge still leaves via a regular exit.\n\n> Is there no way of detecting a misbehaving node that tries to feed jam to my node?\n\nThe current notion of misbehaviour is insufficient and we have all known this for a long time. By analogy, is someone who sits at a restaurant table for 5 hours \"misbehaving\" just because they're taking up a table some other guest could use? No, not really. They're just loitering. If the restaurant gets full the owner may ask them to make space for another guest, but that would not imply misbehaviour on their part.\n\nThe notion of priority this patch introduces fixes this, by allowing peers to be distinguished based on how important they are to the node (or perhaps to Bitcoin as a whole), with a score that only matters when resources start to run low. If resources are sufficient to serve everyone then peer priority does not make any difference.\n\n> If a node calls getblock of the same block(s) repeatedly, or does other irrational things, this could also reduce it's score.\n\nYes, good suggestion. I think priority can eventually subsume the existing misbehaviour system almost entirely. The problem with misbehaviour being, it lets jerks or devs writing buggy code ban shared IPs like carrier NATs, universities, VPNs, Tor exits etc. This has been pointed out in an academic paper and is one of the problems that make Tor-by-default hard to enable for bitcoinj clients.\n\n> What if we would set limits for block relying for the whole full node operation, maybe also per subnet and or also per IP.\n\nI didn't understand this question,s orry.\n\n> I just try to find a way for auto banning nodes without a net QoS with a centralized fixed IP list because i think this would open the cat and mouse game.\n\nYes, a sufficiently motivated attacker will just find other sets of IPs to use. However this might involve not being so anonymous or having to more actively break the law by e.g. renting a botnet. Tor is convenient and easy and using it is legal, even if DoS attacks generally aren't. \n\nSo it's a start, and it addresses an actual observed DoS that someone clearly has the ability to mount right now, even if more work is required to handle every case. Giant oaks tiny acorns, etc.\n",

      "body": "You know, I gotta wonder if going to all this engineering effort trying to blacklist Tor really is worthwhile, given we're still just talking about 125 or something connection slots - getting that many non-Tor IP addresses really isn't all that hard. Just look at how F2Pool was subject to a DoS attack recently that actually knocked a few % off their hashing power - script kiddies routinely play around with botnets with way more than 125 IP addresses. (though this attack would be a good way to discredit Tor! lots of potential suspects there)\n\nEqually I can't see us extending these blacklists much beyond a few hundred nodes without making them highly centralized way; to be effective they need to be updated in real-time like the anti-spam blacklists, and that implies a lack of oversight, which for a technology that needs information to flow freely to be secure probably isn't a good tradeoff to make. It's easy to see how a bad blacklist update that isn't caught could cause serious issues for the network if it's widely deployed. Equally effectively saying to people \"you're nodes will be unreliable if you run them over Tor\" has big problems given the need for business and miners to run anonymized nodes to resist targeted attacks.  (given the lack of reports from others, I have to wonder if Gavin was experiencing a targeted attack?)\n\nHowever! That's not so say we can't have the best of both worlds! Because information propagation security is additive, if we have nodes on the network using both blacklists to resist attack, and more decentralized schemes to resist attack, the security benefit is additive. Some attacks will affect the decentralized schemes more, other attacks will affect the centralized blacklist approach more. So long as an attack can't stall both simultaneously the network will continue to function and maintain consensus. Equally we really could use a second implementation of the P2P logic for the sake of diversity against bugs and exploits, even if it starts off based on Bitcoin Core and gradually moves away from that codebase with design changes.\n\nIn short, I'd strongly encourage you to adopt these changes in Bitcoin XT. It'd be a big benefit to the community, and would allow the two approaches to go in directions that best optimize against attack, separately and thus together, without having to deal with divisive politics getting in the way.\n",

      "body": "The system already has a IP address group (called netgroups).   This hardcoded blacklist of tor nodes is problematic in a couple respects-- it's not sensitive to the host actually being able to exit to the user in particular or even Bitcoin at all-- so it effectively punishes people for running tor exits, even ones that can't reach Bitcoin-- and of course the list will rot.\n\nThe generation procedure gives the operator of a website free reign to add arbitrary hosts to the list as well.\n\nThe claim of tor being convenient isn't quite correct; it takes some fair technical sophistication to figure out how to spread your traffic across multiple exits (as tor doesn't do that by default)-- and in my experience mitigating attacks on Wikimedia attackers used tor as a secondary recourse over other proxies. On IRC the Bitcoin channels have been attacked by thousands of hosts at once with no tor use at all. Also keep in mind that _outbound_ connections which we're normally counting on for partition resistance; so if you're seeing partitioning something very concerning is going wrong that this change will not fix.\n\nSo I suspect the benefit is pretty minimal for the cost of carrying around an always-inaccurate-constantly-bitrotting blacklist.... doubly so I find it weird to do this to specifically target our recommended privacy service while turning a blind eye to the many other known network surveillance and sybil attack systems out there which don't use tor.  (E.g. prior issues requesting blocking some of these services have been closed with no action, even though they'd be easily blockable).\n",

      "body": "If someone does want to take PT's advice and do this in some implementation; at the very minimum it should download the tor directory and verify its signatures from the tor directory authorities; and filter hosts to actually test if they can exit to the port/host in question.  A nice way to handle fetching the directory securely would be gain the feature only when you're running tor alongside the node, and just let tor fetch it for you (the directory it writes is just plain ascii and easily parsed, IIRC); this would avoid having a static phone-home. Similarly, something less aggressive than instantly kicking all \"low priority\" peers when it fills up should really be used-- else the priority part of this is mostly pretext.\n\nI still think doing that is inadvisable relative to an actual sensible general solution, but at least it wouldn't have quite as severe a level of additional damage.\n",

      "body": "I deeply dislike the blacklist idea.\n- This creates hardcoded discrimination on IP addresses, singled out based on anecdotal attacks. What is next, a proposal to make all Chinese IPs second class, because many DoSes originate there? Determined attackers can hire a botnet to get thousands of IPs wherever they want. This only hurts legitimate users - Tor isn't even very suitable for DoS because the capacity is inherently bottlenecked by the exit nodes.\n- This makes it less reliable to run a node behind Tor, which is essential for privacy. We have put much work into making the software usable behind Tor, and this would undo some of that.\n- Fighting DoS in a distributed network should not rely on hardcoded or centralized blacklists. It'd be ripe for abuse to have a central group decide on that. There is need for something more neutral, in the decentralized spirit of P2P.\n\nI'm not opposed to have an _option_ to regard certain networks configured by the node operator as higher-abuse-risk e.g. as an extension of the ban system (note that as of #6310, bans hare persistent). A \"halfban\", so to say. If that is useful - I suppose in most cases what one wants is simply a full ban. But in no case a list will be hardcoded.\n\nLooking forward to @pstratem's proposal.\n",

As I said in the patch description, in fact. It would require more code because Core does not have any way to download files over HTTPS. But there isn't much point in me or anyone else implementing such a thing until the base concept of peer priority is accepted, and a default rule that uses it is pretty much required for such infrastructure to be useful. Given that Tor has been observed taking part in an actual jamming attack, such a rule is as good a place to start as any.\n",

      "message": "Introduce the beginnings of anti-DoS resource scheduling.\n\nPeers now have a priority that attempts to estimate their importance. Currently it is just based on IP address. The default score is zero. In future it may take into account things like how many blocks were relayed, etc. When a node reaches its max connection slots, it will attempt to find a peer with a lower priority than the one trying to connect and disconnect it, to stay below the max connection limit.\n\nPeer priorities are based on matching the connecting IP against a set of IP groups. For now, the only IP group is one that gives Tor exits a score of -10. This is to address DoS attacks that are being reported on the main network in which an attacker builds many connections via Tor to use up all the connection slots and jam the node for clearnet users. It's a more robust approach than simply banning abused proxies altogether.\n\nFor simplicity, a generated list of exits is compiled into the binary. A future enhancement would be to load IP groups from an external file and/or load from HTTPS urls (would require a new dependency on cpp-netlib).\n\nOther anonymizing proxy networks that are attractive to DoS attackers may also be added as alternative IP groups, as a quick fix. Eventually peer priority can be calculated in a more free floating and dynamic manner and the hardcoded IP approach may become unneeded.",

      "body": "Don't the netgroups in bitcoin core have a group for 'onions' (Tor hidden service peers). When a genuine client (one not trying to DoS other nodes) uses bitcoind over Tor, bitcoind will connect to more onion full nodes as opposite to clearnet IP nodes. This should prevent the attack, if not at least limit it. One of my full nodes (dual stack onion + clearnet) currently has 96 connections out of which 38 with onion peers.\n\nIf this is the current behavior, it would make sense to give Tor exit IP addresses a lower priority than other clearnet IP addresses - but I doubt this will stop a DoS attempt, as @petertodd says there are script kiddies out there with thousands of IP addresses, and getting 125 unique non Tor IP addresses is pretty trivial for anyone. It will require more code and additional effort for bitcoind to fetch regularly the dynamically updated Tor exist list and process it, etc. - maybe it's not worth it.\n",

      "body": "@mikehearn if the current behavior is not as I stated above, might be better to make bitcoind check if it can reach onion peers. Assuming it can reach onion peers if it has a proxy set is not reliable since Tor can be used transparently very easy.  The rule is simple, bitcoind should try to connect and if foo.onion is reachable, prefer onion peers vs. clearnet peers. \n\nThis will not affect the clearnet nodes or the dual stack (onion + clearnet reachable nodes). Bitcoind can be easily configured with onlynet=tor ; onion=127.0.0.1:9150  which means one can choose to run a node only behind Tor or Tor and clearnet also. \n\nI don't see why when used with Tor bitcoind would use normal circuits and connect to clearnet peers, when it can prefer rendezvous circuits and connect to onion nodes. This will also decrease the load on the Tor network exit capacity, since Tor exits are scarce, and in a rendezvous circuit to an onion peer Tor will use only non-exit relays. We should get more people running full nodes accessible via Tor hidden services, it's very easy to do so: externalip=foo.onion ; bind=127.0.0.1:8333 ; listen=1  + 2 lines in the torrc file.\n",

Normally when designing DoS defences you want to automate as much as possible. Most node operators won't know there's a DoS happening and find the script, etc.\n\n@gits7r Making bitcoind prefer to connect to hidden service nodes is a different change, it's not related to this one. I guess the concern is that it's then easier to sybil attack outbound connections as well as inbound (there is no real cost to creating lots of .onion addresses that are owned by the same person). However it should be discussed elsewhere.\n",

Every pull you touch turns into a cesspool, a big controversy that detracts from getting day-to-day work done. You are behaving in a way that is toxic to this project. Instead of considered step-by-step development and reasoned discussion, like **all** other people here, you throw something over the wall and start a forceful argument on how you're right and every alternative suggestion is a mistake that will lead to doom and gloom. This is draining our energy. Stop it.\n",

Just remember that relying entirely on 'misbehaviour' lets anyone switch off Tor for everyone, globally: that's the opposite of what you want.\n\nWith respect to my patches being \"cesspools\", I'm afraid I feel everything you just wrote applies to you guys as well. This patch _is_ a considered step by step approach: it's the first step, with many other steps described in pull request message. But if you reject the first step because you don't like the facts of a real attack that actually happened (Tor was abused), you'll never make it to the second step, or third, or fourth. You'll stick around waiting for some perfect \"non controversial\" solution forever.\n\nDon't let \"good is the enemy of the perfect\" stay your modus operandi. That may work in academia. It does not work for a software engineering project.\n",

      "body": "@gits7r \n\n> This will also decrease the load on the Tor network exit capacity, since Tor exits are scarce, and in a rendezvous circuit to an onion peer Tor will use only non-exit relays.\n\nActually I brought up that point at a Tor dev's workshop last year and apparently there has been so much new support that - at least at that point - the situation had reversed to relay capacity being the bottleneck, with plenty of exit capacity available. Still, Jacob Applebaum and others I talked to were highly supportive of making bitcoind support Tor by default with a onion peer strategy - they could definitely make good use of the extra cover traffic and it'd be a gain for Bitcoin as well in terms of censorship and attack resistance.\n\n@mikehearn re: that attack, it'd be helpful if @gavinandresen did a proper writeup on it with details, log files, etc. As @gmaxwell suggested this would make a good issue for the issue tracker as a first step so we can monitor and evaluate the (apparent) problem. At this point the evidence of attack hasn't been peer reviewed after all - could be an isolated incident, or even a misunderstanding.\n",

      "body": "@laanwj +1\n\nYou know, @mikehearn simplifying the issue to 'Don't let \"good is the enemy of the perfect\" stay your modus operandi.' is probably a big part of the problem - changes to Bitcoin aren't things that can be evaluated in a simple, linear, better or worse framework, but rather they have multi-dimensional effects with simultaneous good and bad outcomes. Often the outcomes are significantly time delayed and/or synergistic.\n\n@mikehearn seems to have a particular talent for making proposals that have some good outcomes, but a lot of (often unstated) negative outcomes for other goals. That's a sure-fire recipe for drama and is something that's easily avoided. I myself have made some of the most controversial pull-reqs, but at least things like #6352 start off with explicit compromises and cost/benefit analysis. They're also a relatively small % of my pull-reqs as a whole - the only thing @mikehearn seems to do with his is generate controversy.\n",

      "body": "Yes, you can. However, Tor is significantly easier to use/get access to than most botnets.\n\nPlease read the roadmap at the top. The next step is to handle multiple connections from single IPs better, and to allow user-configurable priority lists. Then a quick fix would be to drop your little botnet IPs into a file and give it lower priority than Tor. After that, Tor connections would evict the botnet.\n\nThen after that, there needs to be ways for a node to figure out priorities automatically, for instance by defining a utility function that doesn't rate all mobile connections as low utility. This is very hard, especially as the code would be open source, but is obviously the gold standard to aim for.\n\nThis is all a lot of work. Contributions of some additional logic to get us further along the path would be appreciated.\n",

      "body": "> Yes, you can. However, Tor is significantly easier to use/get access to than most botnets.\n\nGranted, but the pool of people who might want to grief/DoS Tor users of bitcoin who also can get access to 1-125 IP addresses is pretty large. It would only take one, as a list of Bitcoin node IPs is pretty easy to discover.\n\nOTOH it looks like the way Bitcoin Core works right now is not better, if it's super easy for people to use Tor to fill up all of the connection slots. @mikehearn seems right that, as-is, you don't have many options other than to outright ban all Tor exit nodes in this scenario.\n\nBoth of these seem like crappy options. In both, DoS is easy, and obstructing access to nodes via Tor exits is easy. :( \n\nIn principle, as long as a kludge does not make things worse and is not a foot-in-the-door tactic to undermine privacy in the long term, I see no issue with it. After the redlisting stuff, I can understand why people are concerned about a slippery slope of some kind.\n\nI would like to see some solid proposals about how this DoS attack can be dealt with in a meaningful way. \n\n>  For example, the protocol could allow peers to effectively 'buy' priority by proving ownership of coin age.\n\nAuthenticating the right to connect based on the ownership of coins without compromising privacy seems tricky. Probably some zero-knowledge proof would be required? IMHO any solution that tries to trade privacy for DoS resistance presents an unappealing trade-off. I expect privacy to become increasingly important for Bitcoin users, not less.\n\n> Boost the priority for peers that engage in useful behaviour, like relaying valid blocks and transactions (possibly only with an open port?).\n\nThis sounds interesting. I like the idea of rewarding positive behavior, though so far it seems unclear how you would separate the good actors from the bad ones. \n\n> Because information propagation security is additive, if we have nodes on the network using both blacklists to resist attack, and more decentralized schemes to resist attack, the security benefit is additive. Some attacks will affect the decentralized schemes more, other attacks will affect the centralized blacklist approach more.\n> \n> In short, I'd strongly encourage you to adopt these changes in Bitcoin XT.\n\nAgree with @petertodd on this one. I actually wonder if it would be helpful for some clients to have non-deterministic behavior in this regard; I vaguely recall someone pitching \"chaos monkey\" behavior in another thread on this topic.\n",

      "body": "Another way to look at DoS is in terms of economics. I think the fundamental problem with DoS is asymmetry in costs. Right now, there aren't many connection slots to consume, and it's very cheap (Tor or not -- this seems nearly irrelevant to me) to consume them. Even if we were to increase the number of slots, I bet a DoS attacker can find some operation that will require a node to consume a bunch of resources in order to service the operation.\n\nMy preferred solution -- admittedly a huge engineering effort -- is to have a version of the Bitcoin client that does almost nothing for other nodes unless they pay for it. Processing payment signals would have to be done in such a way that the act of processing payment would not be a viable DoS route itself. Then, aspiring DoS attacks become expensive and probably infeasible in the long term; the more resources you try to consume from your victim, the more you are expected to pay.\n\nCoincidentally, I think this would be helpful in addressing some of the issues related to block size limits as well, but that's a whole other topic.\n",
