    "body": "Instead of using a 100ms sleep in the condition variable, this changes\r\n it to sleep for 100ms after the loop started, so if the loop takes a\r\n long time (e.g. due to waiting on the vnodes lock at the end) it will\r\n restart sooner.\r\n\r\nAlso avoids a potential 100ms delay before announcing a new block that\r\n arrived via submitblock, prevents delays in processing messages for\r\n early peers when they arrive part way through the message handler loop,\r\n and reruns the message handler when some peers don't finish sendmessages\r\n due to contention for cs_main.\r\n\r\nThe final commit  changes the message handling to only hold cs_vRecvMsg long\r\nenough to move out the message. This speeds up IBD up to 200k from a single\r\npeer over GbE compared to master by about 200%, by eliminating cs_vRecvMsg\r\ncontention (that the prior commits happened to also make worse).  With this change\r\non both sides the speedup is ~3.2x.\r\n",

I've been discussing my plans with @TheBlueMatt for doing just that after #9289 is merged.\r\n\r\nSome other fun issues with this loop (I'm sure I'm leaving several out):\r\n- messageHandlerCondition wakes spuriously\r\n- The depth of vRecvGetData and messages to send aren't taken into consideration\r\n- cs_vRecvMsg is held for the duration of message processing, leading to insane lock contention\r\n\r\nI have no objections to slapping some band-aids on here, but I'm really really hoping to address all of those at once in my next PR which moves this handler into net_processing. As a bonus, it should simplify @TheBlueMatt's multi-threaded processing.",

This is less flexible for a clean separation of layers as it requires constant two-way communication between the net layer and the message processor. Done this way, the net must notify the processor that new messages are available, then the processor must grab the messages from the net.\r\n\r\nThe more typical approach (what I’ve seen, anyway) is a one-way model where the net throws its messages to the processor, which is forced to consume them. That greatly reduces the risk of the processor throttling the network. It also makes things much easier as processing becomes multi-threaded, because the processor maintains the message queue, as opposed to having each new thread contend with the net lock. So the net side doesn’t care what happens once it’s handed off a message, it only has to have a means of being corked if the processor is at capacity.\r\n\r\nThe last abstraction step (moving processing out of CConnman, as seen [in a quick/dirty attempt here](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/1a6b10aea129ac363727c2d68fae809c2861e4da)) relies on this one-way model.\r\n\r\nAll that to say: I prefer the approach in #9441, which yields the same speedups :)",

There is communication only one way here: from the ThreadSocketHandler to ThreadMessageHandler  for receive, and the reverse for sending.\r\n\r\nThe processing cannot itself throttle the network (except in terms of the input rate exceeding the processing rate):  Assuming we haven't hit the GetReceiveFloodSize  the only time message processing can stall reception is holding the per-peer lock during a simple move.  The network does let it know new things are available-- allowing it to sleep when there is nothing to do.  \r\n\r\nIf messages were to be handled concurrently, it would be no finer grained than per-peer+per-direction in any case to preserve ordering; which is the granularity of the locks in this configuration. Though message handling takes cs_main for effectively everything, so at the moment there wouldn't really be any gain in making it concurrent.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you're referring to the WakeMessageHandler calls in ProcessMessages?  Those are communication from ThreadMessageHandler to itself-- just reusing the mechanism so that the handler doesn't sleep when there is more work to be done. It could more cleanly be done with a return argument, but the signaling mechanism already exists.\r\n\r\n> which yields the same speedups \r\n\r\nSure takes a lot more code to do it.

      "body": "> I don't follow your two-way comments. There is communication only one way here: from the ThreadSocketHandler to ThreadMessageHandler for receive, and the reverse for sending.\r\n\r\nThreadSocketHandler notifies ThreadMessageHandler that it has a new message. \r\nThreadMessageHandler then reaches into the socket handler's buffer to get and remove it. Logically the queue belongs in the processor so that it can delegate intelligently. After all, the net is done with a message as soon as it's come in.\r\n\r\n> Sure takes a lot more code to do it. The purpose of its architecture is unclear to me, I don't see what we're gaining for the extra complexity.\r\n\r\nEh? It's essentially 2 changes. The first changes to use a return value rather than signaling (as you suggested above): https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9441/commits/1d232f47ab9ad978aa3324e390f8baca1bea72e3\r\n And the second looks much like yours: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9441/commits/65e916c499658e656a6e23455f22666fb0068edc\r\n\r\nMaybe you're referring to the boost commits that it's built on? That's only because they touch so much of the same code that I didn't want to have to keep up with rebasing.",
