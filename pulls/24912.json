    "body": "There was a comment with the `CBlockIndex::nChainTx` data member:\r\n\"Change to 64-bit type before 2024 (assuming worst case of 60 byte transactions).\"\r\n\r\nAs of when this PR was created, there were only around 750,000,000 transactions in the main best chain. That's only in the ballpark of 20% of the range of a 32-bit unsigned int. So, you might think that this is early. But, since I was looking up the references and already doing most of the work, I figured that I'd propose it now. In the least this commit resolves and removes a comment that might otherwise scare more people into doing the same research that I did, thus saving people time.\r\n\r\nI went through all the references to this member and made updates to make the data types line up better where there were differences.\r\n\r\nI also removed a small amount of dead code from SnapshotMetadata, see (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21681#issue-858110318).",
