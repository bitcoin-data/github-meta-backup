    "body": "**Summary:** make very useful `test_framework` Python bindings reusable from outside.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRecently I've been interested in approaches to implement alternate P2P transports, with some prior efforts being\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9979\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16834\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18988\r\n\r\nFacilitating a diversity of both transports and semantics in the peer-to-peer layer seems like a worthwhile effort. At the same time, I've grown wary of undertaking projects that would expand the scope of what Core does.\r\n\r\nThese two ideas have led me to think that one interesting avenue for doing alternative P2P networking is by running a relay program locally alongside bitcoind that can adapt whatever networking logic and protocol the user desires into bitcoin P2P. In conjunction with `-noconnect`/`-addnode` and such a relay, you could have a Bitcoin node that exclusively speaks an alternate network externally without any changes to Core.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is all a roundabout preamble for this fairly modest change, which makes the (very useful and well-maintained) Python utilities we have for interacting with bitcoind `pip` installable and so usable as a library by other programs. A lot of effort has been put into things like P2P message (de)serialization and RPC communication and it would be nice to have these inherently well-maintained utilities reusable from the outside.\r\n\r\nThis is a small proof-of-concept patch that can be more polished if necessary, but as written it makes the `test_framework` infrastructure more generally useful.\r\n\r\nI intend on using this library to build some workable examples of adapting DNS and radio to Bitcoin's P2P communications.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEven beyond alternate P2P designs, these tools would be very handy to be able to reuse; e.g. [`bitcoinperf` rewrites a lot of node management logic](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/bitcoinperf/blob/master/runner/bitcoind.py#L36-L40). It would be preferable to install Python dependencies from this repo, which is already trusted and maintained, than to have to copy/paste vendor code or [go to third parties](https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc).

Offering it as an external API means having to deal with versioning, backwards compatibility, external feature requests, and so on.\r\n\r\nAren't there other Python bitcoin frameworks that could do what you want?\r\n\r\n> It would be preferable to install Python dependencies from this repo, which is already trusted and maintained, than to have to copy/paste vendor code or go to third parties.\r\n\r\nI really dislike this reasoning. Yes, maybe you trust this repo, but we've always resisted the centralizing force of having everything come from a single project and maintained under a single banner. I think this is one of bitcoin's stroing points compared to other coin ecosystems.",

The test framework python code is not meant to be utilities for interacting with `bitcoind`. It's sole purpose is to _be_ the functional test framework. While there is likely some overlapping use-case, I think the test framework code should be written and optimized to efficiently run the test framework only. If people did start using this as a more general-purpose library, I'd be worried that decisions to make it more generally useful might degrade its performance/usefulness in the test framework.\r\n\r\nSecondly, from personal experience, I did repurpose this code for a personal project I was doing and found myself fighting the code a lot and hacking it to make it more generally useful. I ended up using https://ofek.dev/bit/ , which I found to be much easier to use.",

      "body": "Not sure what the goal here is, but the ones mentioned in the OP seem completely different scopes. I think writing an alternative/exclusive transport layer with the test code should not be done. The test structs are *not* guaranteed to be compatible with the p2p layer. They are only guaranteed to be compatible with the Bitcoin Core serialization at one specific commit. I think this should also be our goal, but there seems to be disagreement (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21357#discussion_r600727982)\r\n\r\nAlso, as mentioned previously private keys in the tests are treated like a 123456 password. Not something that should be used outside of tests.\r\n\r\nIf the goal is to make it easier to write external Bitcoin Core tests, then that seems ok. Do you need `pip` for that or can you use the existing TestShell for it? https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/test/functional#prototyping-tests",

I think this should also be our goal, but there seems to be disagreement (#21357 (comment))\r\n\r\nThis seems counter-intuitive, since I would have thought that one of the central purposes of the functional test framework is to serve as external verification that there are not unexpected changes to P2P semantics/serialization. Allowing that the P2P client in the functional tests is overtly coupled to a single Bitcoin Core commit (and not the more general P2P protocol) seems like an unfortunate concession.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you're right that the current `test_framework` code is too muddled with test-specific stuff to be generally useful. Admittedly I haven't repurposed much aside from `test_framework.{p2p,messages}`, neither of which seems to have much test-specific content. Maybe it would be worth outlining those places where there are \"123456 passwords\" and isolating them to a specific module, provided such a thing is not overly cumbersome to do.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway, I guess I'll close this and either do Yet Another Third Party Python Module for my own purposes or think more about an alternate approach - e.g. somehow uniting `src/protocol.*` and components like `net::CSerializedNetMsg` into a shared library that can be used outside of Bitcoin Core and wrapped in $whatever_lang.

      "body": "> Aren't there other Python bitcoin frameworks that could do what you want?\r\n\r\nI've considered proposing a PR like this before too; for testing/research the test_framework API is really handy -- it has a whole bunch of code to allow you to decode bitcoind messages/data structures, to participate in the p2p network, and to get access to the rpc/cli interface. It's definitely not good for use with real secrets/money, though. By comparison, I've found other libraries tend to just not have code for the things I've been interested in, or they've been too out of date to really be useful (eg python-secp256k1 has been unmaintained and out of date, and I see there's a few \"taproot support?\" feature requests recently opened on other python modules). I've found the test_framework code useful for (a) mining signet blocks (contrib/signet/miner) (b) [testing anyprevout/eltoo](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-August/019342.html) (c) [testing taproot based lightning designs](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-October/003278.html).\r\n\r\nBut the \"don't want to encourage using this for production work\" and \"don't want to make it hard to change things in ways that improve bitcoind\" are compelling counter arguments.\r\n\r\nI think at a minimum it should be called \"bitcoin-test-lib\" or something rather than \"bitcoincore\" to emphasise that it's not for production use. Maybe it would make sense to heavily version it, so that you say \"import bitcoin_test_lib.v22 as btctest\" and it's obvious your code will break when you update to v23. If it were done in a separate repo that just copies code from core once a release, you could support both v21, v22, and v23 simultaneously, which might mitigate backwards incompatibilities.",

      "body": "> Allowing that the P2P client in the functional tests is overtly coupled to a single Bitcoin Core commit (and not the more general P2P protocol) seems like an unfortunate concession.\r\n\r\nWhy? If you want to check that older versions of Bitcoin Core can read p2p data from the latest version of Bitcoin Core, you can write a test using previous releases. If that is too much, I think a unit test is better suited to check deserialization compatibility than a functional test. And even if a functional test was the right place, if you wanted to rely on that elsewhere, you'd have to write the serialize logic here first anyway before exposing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I think at a minimum it should be called \"bitcoin-test-lib\" or something rather than \"bitcoincore\" to emphasise that it's not for production use.\r\n\r\nAgree that this is an acceptable alternative. Though, it would still be good to explain the advantages/disadvantages of the different approaches for non-python packaging people. The sys.path.append hack (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23468#issuecomment-963957727) should work for any previous and all future releases already without any patches.",

      "body": "> By comparison, I've found other libraries tend to just not have code for the things I've been interested in, or they've been too out of date to really be useful (eg python-secp256k1 has been unmaintained and out of date, and I see there's a few \"taproot support?\" feature requests recently opened on other python module\r\n\r\nOutside of the specific context of changing the test framework into something it is not, I think this is a good point. I do wish the existing Python libraries for interfacing with bitcoin (e.g. python-bitcoinlib, bit) were more actively maintained. There seems to be a big demand for them (even though @petertodd believes nowadays that Python is a bad choice for that and people should rust instead :smile: ).",
