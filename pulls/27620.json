    "body": "This PR adds missing test coverage for the `-blockmintxfee` option, which can be used by miners to specify the lowest fee-rate for transactions to be included in blocks. The setting was introduced in PR #9380 (commit daec955fd68bd0da036a5b446b54ffb01108adcd), with the rationale to decouple different minimum fees from `-minrelaytxfee`. According to the PR description it _\"should be set by miners to reflect their marginal cost of transmitting extra bytes.\"_.\r\n\r\nOn each iteration, the test creates and submits two txs using MiniWallet: one with the the minimum fee-rate as specified for `-blockmintxfee` and a second one with a fee-rate a little below that (-0.01 sats/vbyte). Then it checks that  only the first one is picked for the block template and accordingly also only exists in the block that is mined after. This is repeatedly done for a fixed (but obviously somewhat arbitrary) list of different `-blockmintxfee` settings on a single node, including the default and zero (i.e. no minimum fee a.k.a. \"include even zero-fee txs\") settings.\r\n",

So, it seems that `-minrelaytxfee=0` is just to make `send_self_transfer` - which calls `sendrawtransaction` - not fail (even if we might not have any connection).",

      "body": "Thanks for reviewing! Addressed the nit.\r\n\r\n> Just a thought that came to my mind while reviewing it:\r\n> \r\n> * Seems like these test coverage uses just 1 node, if we'd stop node1 right before line 81, it wouldn't make the test to fail. So, it seems that `-minrelaytxfee=0` is just to make `send_self_transfer` - which calls `sendrawtransaction` - not fail (even if we might not have any connection).\r\n\r\nYes indeed, this sub-test works with a single node (it follows the design of previously introduced tests `mempool_dust.py` and `mempool_sigoplimit.py`, see #26631, #27171), i.e. with a `self.stop_node(1)` call at the beginning it would still succeed -- just verified that. Decided to not stop node1 though, as I think it makes sense to keep all nodes alive for potential future sub-tests. Note that the `-minrelaytxfee=0` setting is needed in any case, in order to get low/zero-fee-rate txs into the mempool.",
