    "body": "Rationale: Part of the bitcoin zmq interface documentation regarding topics can be improved to avoid ambiguity, this can save time for other people using this interface.\r\n\r\nThe main point is that `rawTx` or `hashTx` topics notifies about all transactions, both when they are added to mempool or _when a block has been disconnected_ ( as opposed to _when a block arrives_ as in current documentation). \r\n\r\nAlso, when a block is disconnected only the transactions that were not in the mempool already are notified. \r\n\r\nFinally, I've added a clarification about the expected sequence of topics when a chain reorganization occur:\r\n\r\n> The secuence of topics when a chain reorganisation occur is the following: first arrives all block disconnections, then transactions not already in our mempool from the disconnected blocks are notified, and finally, the new blocks overriding the disconnected ones.\r\n\r\n",
