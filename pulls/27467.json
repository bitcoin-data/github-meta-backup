If a PR has sufficient review and no substantive technical objections, it should be merged regardless of these comments.\r\n\r\nBut I think these comments are really valuable for helping people decide what to spend time on, and I personally want to encourage more not less \"I don't think this PR is useful\" comments. Sometimes a PR is more useful than it initially appears, and more discussion could help clarify that. Other times, maybe the PR is not really very useful, and having the feedback could help the contributor decide not to put more work into the PR, and avoid having them wonder for months if the PR isn't getting review because it isn't interesting, or is too hard to understand, or just wasn't noticed.\r\n",

      "body": "Per the first line of the diff and the first line of the PR description, a well-named data structure is preferable to one with an out-of-date name that needs a comment to explain what it now does after its role changed.  Our p2p code is sufficiently critical for this to be important, and for that reason we often see review comments requesting clearer naming in p2p changes.\r\n\r\nI think the canned response in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27467#issuecomment-1521500955, and its use, is problematic.  Many commits are merged that change naming for style reasons only, or even do nothing but change indentation, clean up code, change or drop a word, etc. Here, we have a data structure that changed its role, which seems as good a reason as can be to update the naming in order to make sense and not be a footgun for developers or source of confusion. Coming down on renaming when the semantics changed out from under a data structure, but being fine with PRs containing several renaming commits for style reasons only, is a little baroque.  ACKing and merging changes that would fall under that canned response, while punching down on as-valid-or-more other ones inevitably looks arbitrary, hypocritical or favoritist.  A rule or canned response, like the developer notes, ought to be applied consistently or not at all. This particular one is too wide in interpretation and subjective in practice, so when it’s not misapplied, it is at best arbitrary and unhelpful, and at worst is disruptive or negative social signaling that shouldn't be done. For these reasons, my suggestion would be to bin that canned response and not use it at all.\r\n\r\nLet's please encourage review, including post-merge review and occasional fixups that may come from that.  If there's one thing that is perennially desired on this project, it's more eyes on the code and helpful, positive, complementary reviewers to move things forward. As long as a reviewer is well-intentioned and trying to help Bitcoin, let's encourage them with kindness, indulgence and wisdom. Thanks!\r\n",

If anything, it was much more misleading before #27343 when there was no comment, because the name `setConnected` doesn't imply \"netgroups of outbound peers from all networks\" any more than it implies \"netgroups of ipv4/ipv6 outbound peers\" - after all we are \"connected\" to inbound peers too.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not against renaming.",
