      "body": "Hi @MarcoFalke,\r\n\r\nI didn’t got your point on the refereed packaging as this pull request isn’t a concurrent for the current ‘continuous integration’ *gitian* in place, but it’s also one more solution to **heavily** increase the user base by putting an official Bitcoin-core image on docker hub.\r\n\r\nit also isn’t a random dockerfile as I hardly managed to produce a static binary without **any** dependencies (you can check with ldd) and my following plans are to run this right after kernel boot.\r\n\r\nBy your comments I seen some misunderstood about how docker images work because after we find a good dockerfile we don’t have to actively maintain it, as the build process will stay the same for a long time. We don’t have to keep changing it’s contents every time we deploy a new version but instead docker hub will detect the change in our GitHub, fetch the code, build and deploy direct into the biggest marketplace to cloud deployers.\r\n\r\nIt’s a totally different approach to download some random guy dockerfile, who could put some random code inside the container, so you have to check his source file, line by line. And them you have to build yourself and it takes a lot of time, and the worst, most images you referred in your packaging will end up with more than 600mb (1.2Gb during building phase) just to deploy what is supposed to be a very simple deployment.\r\n\r\nas you can see by my files it produces a very simple image using a very simple build structure and build the code using the own GitHub source code and tracking the versions without any human interaction.\r\n\r\nif I push some new code into GitHub it will reflect in maybe 40min into docker.hub official image.\r\n\r\nI hope you can understand that as BITCOIN grows, more deployers will want to use BITCOIN as a service and they didn’t spect to get into Bitcoin .com .org .net or something searching for instructions on how to build (Slackware 2001 feeling) but instead they want deploy automatically using their kubernetes infrastructure and Bitcoin-core is far behind this kind of technology.\r\n\r\nWell, I’m a long time BITCOIN enthusiastic and I’m very happy to be able to deploy BITCOIN inside my clouds without that kind of hassle using a minimal image from a trusted source. \r\n\r\nI can understand the need of everyone build their own code from source as I have been user of Slackware and gentoo for a long time, but this approach is more suitable to enthusiasts than for cloud formations.\r\n\r\nAlso I want keep the attention that the current pull request didn’t change **any** significant code, build process, or any previous work that were being done.\r\n\r\nHaving a official docker hub image for Bitcoin-core is an important step to reduce the distance between the users and the developers and can raise *significantly* the numbers of nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nif you have any more questions I’m glad to help.\r\n",

      "body": "> I've been building bitcoin since 2015 in the same way, cd depends;make....cd ..; ./configure; make; make install, so not much change. As the dependency packages change they will probably be added to depends folder to pass the tests and if it's too much of a problem I can maintain it myself for the best of our community.\r\n\r\nDepends are also used by our release builds in Guix, so yes this is an improvement. Though the dockerfile attached to this pull request doesn't use depends, unless I am missing something?\r\n\r\n> In the same way someone can inject a key stealing inside any CI environment and get advantage of that.\r\n\r\nWe don't use a CI environment in any of our release process, so this shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\n> If you aren't happy by my work here ...\r\n\r\nI appreciate the work, and I don't reject it in any way. I am trying to explain why a docker image didn't exist in the past and why using the official release binaries might be preferable and potentially could be moving this effort forward.\r\n\r\nThere is also a good point by @sipa that maybe the release process itself can(?) be used to create the docker image.\r\n\r\nI am not a docker expert myself, so I can't comment on the implementation of this, but I think the current dockerfile in this pull is not going to be accepted as is. It should be easy to at least use the depends system, which also shouldn't come with any downside.\r\n\r\n> Note that this isn't about trust in maintainers; it's about verifiability.\r\n\r\nOur current \"build from source\" instructions are not verifiable either, so at least in theory it is thinkable that a dockerfile that mimics this documentation is added and left for the users at their own risk, just as the build docs are left for them at their own risk.\r\n\r\nHowever, given that the goal here seems to be to ship release builds, it should be easier and without downsides to ship the existing releases via docker.",

It removes a aource of variability and possible bugs. It would allow getting rid of all the **glibc compatibility hacks**.\r\n\r\nDONE.\r\n\r\n> Again, we are not using CI/CD as part of the release process and this also not going to change.\r\n\r\nI hope you guys change your mind about that as docker hub can maintain all the versions at same time and if you don't want to deploy the lastest version automatically you can do it by click, we can even run the tests and see the results on the build system of docker hub.\r\n\r\n> I presume it is impossible to create a docker image (binary file) and distribute that via our own website? The only way to distribute images is via docker hub?\r\n\r\nIt's not impossible but its counter-intuitive as the system is design to assit the developer and not give him more repetitive work.\r\nBTW you can build the image locally and use > docker push image:version\r\nOne can also > docker save busybox > busybox.tar but again not close to the best choice.\r\n\r\nTo keep the confidence and trust you guys talk, docker hub has versioned deployment, and one can write like bitcoin:trusted_version or any other branch and leave the last commit on master to bitcon:latest and write on the readme.md that :latest isn't trustable, and use at your own risk.",

      "body": "Just for reference, when I search for bitcoin on the [marketplace](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=bitcoin&type=image) today, the first result is something which stands for [bitcoin-sv](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitcoinsv/bitcoin-sv), 50k downloads.\r\n\r\nAfter some scrolling I found something relevant with 8.9M downloads, which sounds like real bitcoin, build from unknown provider, [kylemanna](https://hub.docker.com/r/kylemanna/bitcoind). Ruimarino also has 1M downloads, but I didn't want trust.\r\n\r\nA big project like bitcoin should have it's own repository, connected to the official github repository, build from scratch, following the tags and branches on github, with all images from all times available with one click.\r\n\r\nThe project can run its tests during the build process and show the result as bonus, because we can browse and understand better how the tests are made, and if something is wrong with the binary.\r\n\r\nThe search result has more than 10 pages, with many altcoins wrong named bitcoin, which lead to confusion and distrust and not a single build from this repository.\r\n\r\nFor me it's a major risk to keep the things in this way. \r\nWhen someone want deploy a cloud application after finish the amatour phase, goes direct to docker hub, and there's only two bad choices: \r\n1- trust one unknown \r\n2- find and build a good image\r\n\r\nAs you can see by yourself, more than 10M people had to download and run this images that can easily contain a key stealer and the providers can easily hide the current Dockerfile for the image present on the docker hub. They can even fake which source was used to deploy.\r\n\r\nSo, please, consider you're putting many users at risk when you choose to keep the things as it's.\r\n\r\nMy current image was designed using milestone/52, musl and removing totally the external dependencies. But other images can contain alpine, or ubuntu, using glibc etc. \r\nThis will give the user the power to choose, and will remove the need to trust. Mostly because after you put the build process there we can check the tests and see how the image was build and which errors/warnings.\r\n\r\nAll this without need to change the current deployment for hackers and contributers.\r\nFor me it's a win-win. \r\nHope you all understand, and I'll be here to answer/help and also on CT.\r\n",
