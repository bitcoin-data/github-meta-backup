Oversampling is eliminated by changing the\nPartitionCheck funtion to return the interval at which it must be run,\nand scheduling it at that interval.\n\nA much smaller bias in the other direction is also eliminated.  The\npoisson PDF was being used to check the likelihood of a specific\nobservation, a method which is incorrectly sensitive to the size of the\nsample inteval.  This is corrected by using the poisson CDF and doing a\nseparate statistical check for the high and low cases.\n\nThe effect of the third correction is small because, in practice, the\ntargeted PDF levels accounted for almost all of the probability mass\nin the neighborhood of the test.",

      "body": "The math is correct, i.e. the false positive rate is once every ~ 50 years assuming an average block time of 10 min. To be clear, this is the combined (two-sided) alert rate; the one-sided alerts (pHigh or pLow) have individual rates of every ~ 100 years.\n\nThis is in contrast to the original code, which from [simulation](https://gist.github.com/bitcoinfees/0f2203bdced119b98c30), gives an alert rate of ~ 3.5 years.\n\nAdditional statistics: assuming the block rate deviates from the proof-of-work target by 20% (due to changing hash rate), then pHigh / pLow will have rates of once per 3 / 8 years respectively, which seems reasonable.  If this is deemed too high, the test can be modified to allow for deviations up to a specified amount.\n\nThe other significant change here is that the test spans are made non-overlapping, and their frequency is reduced from once per 10 minutes to once per 130 minutes. This unfortunately reduces the potential statistical power (the ability to correctly detect an anomaly), and also adds latency to the alerts.\n\nThe main reason for this change is that is not trivial to determine the threshold for overlapping spans. It can be done by simulation, but that's not as a good as the closed-form solution that you would get for non-overlapping spans.\n",

With the computed threshold and assuming constant hashrate, the fail-high (>=33 blocks in 120 minutes) should trigger for this node every ~100 years.\n\nHowever, this is not the only node on the network; and different nodes start at different times, and so they sample on different schedules. So there are more opportunities for the alarm to be falsely triggered somewhere on the network.\n\nSo if the event we are trying to prevent is \"hashrate is constant and yet an alarm is triggered somewhere on the network\" then this is no better than the original method where each node sampled continuously (because the network as a whole sampled continuously). For the new parameters, I estimate it will trigger every ~18 years (I haven't run simulations yet).\n\nOn top of that we have the added confusion of some nodes reporting an alarm while others do not.\n\nIt would make more sense to me if each node tested for the alarm once when it starts, and then on a 4-hour schedule which is the same for all nodes.\n",

      "body": "So there are various issues, and it seems different people are arguing for\nfixing different ones.\n- The probabilities in the current code are wrong, they're using PDF\n  instead of CDF. This PR fixes it.\n- The current code samples overlapping periods, causing the false positive\n  rate to be too high. This PR fixes it.\n- We're not taking into account that the difficulty does not necessarily\n  corresponds to the actual hashrate. For extreme cases, the whole point is\n  of course exactly just detecting that, but if there is normal steady\n  continuous growth of the hashrate, the difficulty is on average slightly\n  off, and the probabilities don't take that into account. We could account\n  for that by just multiplying or dividing by 1.1 towards the expected value,\n  but the PR here does not do that.\n- We're not taking into account that the block timestamps do not\n  necessarily correspond to the actual block generation timestamps. We could\n  fix that by remembering the actual local system time at which a block was\n  received, but that would only work for long running nodes.\n- Depending on whether you consider a single node to be showing an false\n  alert to be less bad, the fact that different nodes check at different\n  times may or may not be a problem. As suggested before, using coordinated\n  check times would fix that.\n",
