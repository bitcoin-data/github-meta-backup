This is largely equivalent to maually performing what the shell installer\n+script does.\n+\n+## Option 3: TODO fanquake docker\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian/Ubuntu\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) (\"bullseye\") and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix) (Hirsute Hippo).\n+\n+To install:\n+```sh\n+sudo apt install guix\n+```\n+\n+For up-to-date information on Debian and Ubuntu's release history:\n+- [Debian release history](https://www.debian.org/releases/)\n+- [Ubuntu release history](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)\n+\n+### Arch Linux\n+\n+Guix is available in the AUR as\n+[`guix`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guix/), please follow the\n+installation instructions in the Arch Linux Wiki ([live\n+link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Guix#AUR_Package_Installation),\n+[2021/03/30\n+permalink](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Guix&oldid=637559#AUR_Package_Installation))\n+to install Guix.\n+\n+At the time of writing (2021/03/30), the `check` phase will fail if the path to\n+guix's build directory is longer than 36 characters due to an anachronistic\n+character limit on the shebang line. Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1. Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](), install it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+*A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with this simple routine:\n+\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+\n+autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` requires that a\n+debian-derived distribution has `zlib1g-dev` installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](), install it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+*A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with this simple routine:\n+\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+\n+autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` requires that a\n+debian-derived distribution has `zlib1g-dev` installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

More information on standard Automake directory variables\n+can be found\n+[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Standard-Directory-Variables.html).\n+\n+However, the Guix init scripts and service configurations for Upstart, systemd,\n+SysV, and OpenRC are installed to launch\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon`,\n+which does not yet exist, and will only exist after `root` performs their first\n+`guix pull`.\n+\n+We need to create a `-original` version of these init scripts that's pointed to\n+binaries in `${bindir}` (normally, `/usr/local/bin`).\n+\n+Example for `systemd`, run as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+# Create guix-daemon-original.service by modifying guix-daemon.service\n+bindir=\"$(dirname $(command -v guix-daemon))\"\n+sed -E -e \"s|/\\S*/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon|${bindir}/guix-daemon|\" /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service > /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+\n+# Make systemd recognize the new service\n+systemctl daemon-reload\n+\n+# Make sure that the non-working guix-daemon.service is stopped and disabled\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon\n+\n+# Make sure that the working guix-daemon-original.service is started and enabled\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl start guix-daemon-original\n+```\n+\n+###### Create guix-daemon users / groups\n+\n+Please see the [relevant\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Build-Environment-Setup.html)\n+in the Guix Reference Manual for more details.\n+\n+## Optional setup\n+\n+At this point, you are set up to [use Guix to build bitcoin](). However, if you\n+want to polish your setup a bit and make it \"what Guix intended\", then read the\n+next few subsections.\n+\n+### Add an `/etc/profile.d` entry\n+\n+Although Guix knows how to update itself and its packages, it does so in a\n+non-invasive way (it does not modify `/usr/local/bin/guix`).\n+\n+Instead, it does the following:\n+\n+- After a `guix pull`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/current-guix`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.config/guix/current`\n+\n+- After a `guix install`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/guix-profile`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.guix-profile`\n+\n+Therefore, in order for these operations to effect your shell/desktop sessions\n+(and for the principle of least astonishment to hold), their corresponding\n+directories have to be added to well-known environment variables like `$PATH`,\n+`$INFOPATH`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, etc.\n+\n+In other words, if `$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin` does not exist in your\n+`$PATH`, a `guix pull` will have no effect on what `guix` you are using. Same\n+goes for `$HOME/.guix-profile/bin`, `guix install`, and installed packages.\n+\n+Helpfully, after a `guix pull` or `guix install`, a message will be printed like\n+so:\n+\n+```\n+hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:\n+\n+     GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+     . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p \"$HOME/.guix-profile\"'.\n+```\n+\n+However, this is somewhat tedious to do for both `guix pull` and `guix install`\n+for each user on the system that wants to properly use `guix`. I recommend that\n+you instead add an entry to `/etc/profile.d` instead. This is done by default\n+when installing the Debian package later than 1.2.0-4 and when using the shell\n+script installer.\n+\n+Create `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` with the following content:\n+```sh\n+# _GUIX_PROFILE: `guix pull` profile\n+_GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.config/guix/current\"\n+if [ -L $_GUIX_PROFILE ]; then\n+  export PATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"\n+  # Export INFOPATH so that the updated info pages can be found\n+  # and read by both /usr/bin/info and/or $GUIX_PROFILE/bin/info\n+  # When INFOPATH is unset, add a trailing colon so that Emacs\n+  # searches 'Info-default-directory-list'.\n+  export INFOPATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\n+fi\n+\n+# GUIX_PROFILE: User's default profile\n+GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+[ -L $GUIX_PROFILE ] || return\n+GUIX_LOCPATH=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale\"\n+export GUIX_PROFILE GUIX_LOCPATH\n+\n+[ -f \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\" ] && . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+# set XDG_DATA_DIRS to include Guix installations\n+export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}\"\n+```\n+\n+Please note that this will not take effect until the next shell or desktop\n+session (log out and log back in).\n+\n+### `guix pull` as root\n+\n+Before you do this, you need to read [choose your security model]() and adjust\n+`guix` and `guix-daemon` flags according to your choice, as invoking `guix pull`\n+may pull substitutes from substitute servers (which you may not want).\n+\n+As mentioned in a previous section, Guix expects\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` to be populated with\n+`root`'s Guix profile, `guix pull`-ed and built by some former version of Guix.\n+However, this is not the case when we build from source. Therefore, we need to\n+perform a `guix pull` as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+sudo --login guix pull --branch=version-<latest-release-version>\n+# or\n+sudo --login guix pull --commit=<particular-commit>\n+```\n+\n+`guix pull` is quite a long process (espcially if you're using\n+`--no-substitute`). If you encounter build problems, please refer to the\n+[troubleshooting section]().\n+\n+Note that running a bare `guix pull` with no commit or branch specified will\n+pull the latest commit on Guix's master branch, which is likely fine, but not\n+recommended.\n+\n+If you installed Guix from source, you may get an error like the following:\n+```sh\n+error: while creating symlink '/root/.config/guix/current' No such file or directory\n+```\n+To resolve this, simply:\n+```\n+sudo mkdir -p /root/.config/guix\n+```\n+Then try the `guix pull` command again.\n+\n+After the `guix pull` finishes successfully,\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` should be populated.\n+\n+### Restarting the daemon\n+\n+If you built Guix from source and followed the instructions for [fixing argv\\[0\\]](), you can\n+now do the following:\n+\n+```sh\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon-original\n+\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon\n+systemctl start guix-daemon\n+```\n+\n+Otherwise, simply do:\n \n-### Installing Guix\n+```sh\n+systemctl restart guix-daemon\n+```\n+\n+### Checking everything\n+\n+If you followed all the steps above to make your Guix setup \"prim and proper,\"\n+you can check that you did everything properly by running through this\n+checklist.\n+\n+1. `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` should exist and be sourced at each shell login\n \n-If you're just testing this out, you can use the\n-[Dockerfile][fanquake/guix-docker] for convenience.

In particular, the official shell installer\n+script asks you if you want the key installed, and the debian distribution\n+package authorized the key during installation.\n+\n+You can check the current list of authorized keys at `/etc/guix/acl`.\n+\n+At the time of writing, a `/etc/guix/acl` with just the Guix build farm key\n+authorized looks something like:\n+```lisp\n+(acl\n+ (entry\n+  (public-key\n+   (ecc\n+    (curve Ed25519)\n+    (q #8D156F295D24B0D9A86FA5741A840FF2D24F60F7B6C4134814AD55625971B394#)\n+    )\n+   )\n+  (tag\n+   (guix import)\n+   )\n+  )\n+ )\n+```\n \n-After installation, you may want to consider [adding substitute\n-servers](#speeding-up-builds-with-substitute-servers) from which to download\n-pre-built packages to speed up your build if that fits your security model (say,\n-if you're just testing that this works). Substitute servers are set up by\n-default if you're using the [Dockerfile][fanquake/guix-docker].\n+If you've determined that the official Guix build farm key hasn't been\n+authorized, and you would like to authorize it, run the following as root:\n+\n+```\n+guix archive --authorize < /var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub\n+```\n+\n+If\n+`/var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub`\n+doesn't exist, try:\n+\n+```sh\n+guix archive --authorize < <PREFIX>/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub\n+```\n+\n+Where <PREFIX> is likely:\n+- `/usr` if you installed from a distribution package\n+- `/usr/local` if you installed Guix from source and didn't supply any\n+  prefix-modifying flags to Guix's `./configure`\n+\n+For dongcarl's substitute server at https://guix.carldong.io, run as root:\n+\n+```sh\n+wget -qO- 'https://guix.carldong.io/signing-key.pub' | guix archive --authorize\n+```\n+\n+### Step 2: Specify the substitute servers\n+\n+Once its key is authorized, the official Guix build farm at\n+https://ci.guix.gnu.org is automatically used unless the `--no-substitutes` flag\n+is supplied.

Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](), install it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+*A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with this simple routine:\n+\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+\n+autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` requires that a\n+debian-derived distribution has `zlib1g-dev` installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

However, if you\n+want to polish your setup a bit and make it \"what Guix intended\", then read the\n+next few subsections.\n+\n+### Add an `/etc/profile.d` entry\n+\n+Although Guix knows how to update itself and its packages, it does so in a\n+non-invasive way (it does not modify `/usr/local/bin/guix`).\n+\n+Instead, it does the following:\n+\n+- After a `guix pull`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/current-guix`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.config/guix/current`\n+\n+- After a `guix install`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/guix-profile`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.guix-profile`\n+\n+Therefore, in order for these operations to effect your shell/desktop sessions\n+(and for the principle of least astonishment to hold), their corresponding\n+directories have to be added to well-known environment variables like `$PATH`,\n+`$INFOPATH`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, etc.\n+\n+In other words, if `$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin` does not exist in your\n+`$PATH`, a `guix pull` will have no effect on what `guix` you are using. Same\n+goes for `$HOME/.guix-profile/bin`, `guix install`, and installed packages.\n+\n+Helpfully, after a `guix pull` or `guix install`, a message will be printed like\n+so:\n+\n+```\n+hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:\n+\n+     GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+     . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p \"$HOME/.guix-profile\"'.\n+```\n+\n+However, this is somewhat tedious to do for both `guix pull` and `guix install`\n+for each user on the system that wants to properly use `guix`. I recommend that\n+you instead add an entry to `/etc/profile.d` instead. This is done by default\n+when installing the Debian package later than 1.2.0-4 and when using the shell\n+script installer.\n+\n+Create `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` with the following content:\n+```sh\n+# _GUIX_PROFILE: `guix pull` profile\n+_GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.config/guix/current\"\n+if [ -L $_GUIX_PROFILE ]; then\n+  export PATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"\n+  # Export INFOPATH so that the updated info pages can be found\n+  # and read by both /usr/bin/info and/or $GUIX_PROFILE/bin/info\n+  # When INFOPATH is unset, add a trailing colon so that Emacs\n+  # searches 'Info-default-directory-list'.\n+  export INFOPATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\n+fi\n+\n+# GUIX_PROFILE: User's default profile\n+GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+[ -L $GUIX_PROFILE ] || return\n+GUIX_LOCPATH=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale\"\n+export GUIX_PROFILE GUIX_LOCPATH\n+\n+[ -f \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\" ] && . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+# set XDG_DATA_DIRS to include Guix installations\n+export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}\"\n+```\n+\n+Please note that this will not take effect until the next shell or desktop\n+session (log out and log back in).\n+\n+### `guix pull` as root\n+\n+Before you do this, you need to read [choose your security model]() and adjust\n+`guix` and `guix-daemon` flags according to your choice, as invoking `guix pull`\n+may pull substitutes from substitute servers (which you may not want).\n+\n+As mentioned in a previous section, Guix expects\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` to be populated with\n+`root`'s Guix profile, `guix pull`-ed and built by some former version of Guix.\n+However, this is not the case when we build from source. Therefore, we need to\n+perform a `guix pull` as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+sudo --login guix pull --branch=version-<latest-release-version>\n+# or\n+sudo --login guix pull --commit=<particular-commit>\n+```\n+\n+`guix pull` is quite a long process (espcially if you're using",

Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1.

Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](), install it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+*A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with this simple routine:\n+\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+\n+autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` requires that a\n+debian-derived distribution has `zlib1g-dev` installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations. See\n+the last paragraph of this\n+[section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) for more\n+details.\n+\n+Build Guix (this will take a while):\n+```\n+make -j$(nproc)\n+```\n+\n+Install Guix:\n+\n+```\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+##### Setting Up the Daemon\n+\n+###### Fixing `argv[0]`\n+\n+At this point, guix will be installed to `${bindir}`, which is likely\n+`/usr/local/bin` if you did not override directory variables at\n+`./configure`-time. More information on standard Automake directory variables\n+can be found\n+[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Standard-Directory-Variables.html).\n+\n+However, the Guix init scripts and service configurations for Upstart, systemd,\n+SysV, and OpenRC are installed to launch\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon`,\n+which does not yet exist, and will only exist after `root` performs their first\n+`guix pull`.\n+\n+We need to create a `-original` version of these init scripts that's pointed to\n+binaries in `${bindir}` (normally, `/usr/local/bin`).\n+\n+Example for `systemd`, run as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+# Create guix-daemon-original.service by modifying guix-daemon.service\n+bindir=\"$(dirname $(command -v guix-daemon))\"\n+sed -E -e \"s|/\\S*/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon|${bindir}/guix-daemon|\" /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service > /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+\n+# Make systemd recognize the new service\n+systemctl daemon-reload\n+\n+# Make sure that the non-working guix-daemon.service is stopped and disabled\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon\n+\n+# Make sure that the working guix-daemon-original.service is started and enabled\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl start guix-daemon-original\n+```\n+\n+###### Create guix-daemon users / groups\n+\n+Please see the [relevant\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Build-Environment-Setup.html)\n+in the Guix Reference Manual for more details.\n+\n+## Optional setup\n+\n+At this point, you are set up to [use Guix to build bitcoin](). However, if you\n+want to polish your setup a bit and make it \"what Guix intended\", then read the\n+next few subsections.\n+\n+### Add an `/etc/profile.d` entry\n+\n+Although Guix knows how to update itself and its packages, it does so in a\n+non-invasive way (it does not modify `/usr/local/bin/guix`).\n+\n+Instead, it does the following:\n+\n+- After a `guix pull`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/current-guix`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.config/guix/current`\n+\n+- After a `guix install`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/guix-profile`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.guix-profile`\n+\n+Therefore, in order for these operations to effect your shell/desktop sessions\n+(and for the principle of least astonishment to hold), their corresponding\n+directories have to be added to well-known environment variables like `$PATH`,\n+`$INFOPATH`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, etc.\n+\n+In other words, if `$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin` does not exist in your\n+`$PATH`, a `guix pull` will have no effect on what `guix` you are using. Same\n+goes for `$HOME/.guix-profile/bin`, `guix install`, and installed packages.\n+\n+Helpfully, after a `guix pull` or `guix install`, a message will be printed like\n+so:\n+\n+```\n+hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:\n+\n+     GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+     . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p \"$HOME/.guix-profile\"'.\n+```\n+\n+However, this is somewhat tedious to do for both `guix pull` and `guix install`\n+for each user on the system that wants to properly use `guix`. I recommend that\n+you instead add an entry to `/etc/profile.d` instead. This is done by default\n+when installing the Debian package later than 1.2.0-4 and when using the shell\n+script installer.\n+\n+Create `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` with the following content:\n+```sh\n+# _GUIX_PROFILE: `guix pull` profile\n+_GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.config/guix/current\"\n+if [ -L $_GUIX_PROFILE ]; then\n+  export PATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"\n+  # Export INFOPATH so that the updated info pages can be found\n+  # and read by both /usr/bin/info and/or $GUIX_PROFILE/bin/info\n+  # When INFOPATH is unset, add a trailing colon so that Emacs\n+  # searches 'Info-default-directory-list'.\n+  export INFOPATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\n+fi\n+\n+# GUIX_PROFILE: User's default profile\n+GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+[ -L $GUIX_PROFILE ] || return\n+GUIX_LOCPATH=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale\"\n+export GUIX_PROFILE GUIX_LOCPATH\n+\n+[ -f \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\" ] && . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+# set XDG_DATA_DIRS to include Guix installations\n+export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}\"\n+```\n+\n+Please note that this will not take effect until the next shell or desktop\n+session (log out and log back in).\n+\n+### `guix pull` as root\n+\n+Before you do this, you need to read [choose your security model]() and adjust\n+`guix` and `guix-daemon` flags according to your choice, as invoking `guix pull`\n+may pull substitutes from substitute servers (which you may not want).\n+\n+As mentioned in a previous section, Guix expects\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` to be populated with\n+`root`'s Guix profile, `guix pull`-ed and built by some former version of Guix.\n+However, this is not the case when we build from source. Therefore, we need to\n+perform a `guix pull` as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+sudo --login guix pull --branch=version-<latest-release-version>\n+# or\n+sudo --login guix pull --commit=<particular-commit>\n+```\n+\n+`guix pull` is quite a long process (espcially if you're using\n+`--no-substitute`). If you encounter build problems, please refer to the\n+[troubleshooting section]().\n+\n+Note that running a bare `guix pull` with no commit or branch specified will\n+pull the latest commit on Guix's master branch, which is likely fine, but not\n+recommended.\n+\n+If you installed Guix from source, you may get an error like the following:\n+```sh\n+error: while creating symlink '/root/.config/guix/current' No such file or directory\n+```\n+To resolve this, simply:\n+```\n+sudo mkdir -p /root/.config/guix\n+```\n+Then try the `guix pull` command again.\n+\n+After the `guix pull` finishes successfully,\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` should be populated.\n+\n+### Restarting the daemon\n+\n+If you built Guix from source and followed the instructions for [fixing argv\\[0\\]](), you can\n+now do the following:\n+\n+```sh\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon-original\n+\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon\n+systemctl start guix-daemon\n+```\n+\n+Otherwise, simply do:\n \n-### Installing Guix\n+```sh\n+systemctl restart guix-daemon\n+```\n+\n+### Checking everything\n+\n+If you followed all the steps above to make your Guix setup \"prim and proper,\"\n+you can check that you did everything properly by running through this\n+checklist.\n+\n+1. `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` should exist and be sourced at each shell login\n \n-If you're just testing this out, you can use the\n-[Dockerfile][fanquake/guix-docker] for convenience. It automatically speeds up\n-your builds by [using substitutes](#speeding-up-builds-with-substitute-servers).\n-If you don't want this behaviour, refer to the [next\n-section](#choosing-your-security-model).\n+2. `guix describe` should not print `guix describe: error: failed to determine\n+   origin`, but rather something like:\n \n-Otherwise, follow the [Guix installation guide][guix/bin-install].\n+   ```\n+   Generation 38   Feb 22 2021 16:39:31    (current)\n+     guix f350df4\n+       repository URL: https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+       branch: version-1.2.0\n+       commit: f350df405fbcd5b9e27e6b6aa500da7f101f41e7\n+   ```\n \n-> Note: For those who like to keep their filesystems clean, Guix is designed to\n-> be very standalone and _will not_ conflict with your system's package\n-> manager/existing setup.

However, it doesn't sacrifice user choice in pursuit of\n-this: users can decide whether or not to bootstrap and to use substitutes\n-(pre-built packages).\n+this: users can decide whether or not to use substitutes (pre-built packages).\n+\n+## Option 1: Building with substitutes\n+\n+### Step 1: Authorize the signing keys\n+\n+Depending on the installation procedure you followed, you may have already\n+authorized the Guix build farm key. In particular, the official shell installer\n+script asks you if you want the key installed, and the debian distribution\n+package authorized the key during installation.\n+\n+You can check the current list of authorized keys at `/etc/guix/acl`.\n+\n+At the time of writing, a `/etc/guix/acl` with just the Guix build farm key\n+authorized looks something like:\n+```lisp\n+(acl\n+ (entry\n+  (public-key\n+   (ecc\n+    (curve Ed25519)\n+    (q #8D156F295D24B0D9A86FA5741A840FF2D24F60F7B6C4134814AD55625971B394#)\n+    )\n+   )\n+  (tag\n+   (guix import)\n+   )\n+  )\n+ )\n+```\n \n-After installation, you may want to consider [adding substitute\n-servers](#speeding-up-builds-with-substitute-servers) from which to download\n-pre-built packages to speed up your build if that fits your security model (say,\n-if you're just testing that this works). Substitute servers are set up by\n-default if you're using the [Dockerfile][fanquake/guix-docker].\n+If you've determined that the official Guix build farm key hasn't been\n+authorized, and you would like to authorize it, run the following as root:\n+\n+```\n+guix archive --authorize < /var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub\n+```\n+\n+If\n+`/var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub`\n+doesn't exist, try:\n+\n+```sh\n+guix archive --authorize < <PREFIX>/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub\n+```\n+\n+Where <PREFIX> is likely:\n+- `/usr` if you installed from a distribution package\n+- `/usr/local` if you installed Guix from source and didn't supply any\n+  prefix-modifying flags to Guix's `./configure`\n+\n+For dongcarl's substitute server at https://guix.carldong.io, run as root:\n+\n+```sh\n+wget -qO- 'https://guix.carldong.io/signing-key.pub' | guix archive --authorize\n+```\n+\n+### Step 2: Specify the substitute servers\n+\n+Once its key is authorized, the official Guix build farm at\n+https://ci.guix.gnu.org is automatically used unless the `--no-substitutes` flag\n+is supplied. This behaviour is overridable. See examples below for the various\n+ways of adding dongcarl's substitute server after having [authorized his signing\n+key](#authorize-the-signing-keys).\n+\n+Change the default list of substitute servers by starting `guix-daemon` with the\n+`--substitute-urls` option:\n+```\n+guix <cmd> --substitute-urls=\"https://guix.carldong.io https://ci.guix.gnu.org\"\n+```\n+\n+Override the default list of substitute servers by passing the\n+`--substitute-urls` option for invocations of `guix` commands:\n+```\n+guix <cmd> --substitute-urls=\"https://guix.carldong.io https://ci.guix.gnu.org\"\n+```\n+\n+For scripts under `./contrib/guix`, set the `SUBSTITUTE_URLS` environment\n+variable:\n+```\n+export SUBSTITUTE_URLS='https://guix.carldong.io https://ci.guix.gnu.org'\n+```\n+\n+## Option 2: Disabling subsitutes on an ad-hoc basis",

If you have already completed the\n+installation and setup, please proceed to [perform a build](./README.md).\n+\n+Otherwise, you may choose from one of the following options to install Guix:\n+\n+1. Using the official **shell installer script** [⤓ skip to section][install-script]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Easiest (automatically performs *most* setup)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Only installs latest release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+   - Note: The script needs to be run as root, so it should be inspected before it's run\n+2. Using the official **binary tarball** [⤓ skip to section][install-bin-tarball]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Normal difficulty (full manual setup required)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+3. Using fanquake's **Docker image** [↗︎ external instructions][install-fanquake-docker]\n+   - Maintained by fanquake\n+   - Easy (automatically performs *some* setup)\n+   - Works on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+4. Using a **distribution-maintained package** [⤓ skip to section][install-distro-pkg]\n+   - Maintained by distribution's Guix package maintainer\n+   - Normal difficulty (manual setup required)\n+   - Works only on distributions with Guix packaged, at time of writing:\n+     - Debian Bullseye or later\n+     - Ubuntu Hirsute or later\n+     - Arch Linux (via AUR)\n+   - Installs a release decided on by package maintainer\n+   - Source or binary installation depending on the distribution\n+5. Building **from source** [⤓ skip to section][install-source]\n+   - Maintained by you\n+   - Hard, but rewarding\n+   - Can be made to work on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any commit (more granular)\n+   - Source installation, requires lower level of trust\n+\n+## Options 1 and 2: Using the official shell installer script or binary tarball\n+\n+The installation instructions for both using the offical shell installer script\n+and using binary tarballs can be found in the GNU Guix Manual's [Binary\n+Installation\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html).\n+\n+Note that running through the binary tarball installation steps is largely\n+equivalent to manually performing what the shell installer script does.\n+\n+Note that at the time of writing (July 5th, 2021), the shell installer script\n+automatically creates an `/etc/profile.d` entry which the binary tarball\n+installation instructions do not ask you to create. However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source. Solutions and workarounds are documented\n+[here](#gnutls-test-suite-fail-status-request-revoked).\n+\n+\n+To install:\n+```sh\n+sudo apt install guix\n+```\n+\n+For up-to-date information on Debian and Ubuntu's release history:\n+- [Debian release history](https://www.debian.org/releases/)\n+- [Ubuntu release history](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)\n+\n+### Arch Linux\n+\n+Guix is available in the AUR as\n+[`guix`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guix/), please follow the\n+installation instructions in the Arch Linux Wiki ([live\n+link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Guix#AUR_Package_Installation),\n+[2021/03/30\n+permalink](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Guix&oldid=637559#AUR_Package_Installation))\n+to install Guix.\n+\n+At the time of writing (2021/03/30), the `check` phase will fail if the path to\n+guix's build directory is longer than 36 characters due to an anachronistic\n+character limit on the shebang line. Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1. Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

If you have already completed the\n+installation and setup, please proceed to [perform a build](./README.md).\n+\n+Otherwise, you may choose from one of the following options to install Guix:\n+\n+1. Using the official **shell installer script** [⤓ skip to section][install-script]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Easiest (automatically performs *most* setup)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Only installs latest release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+   - Note: The script needs to be run as root, so it should be inspected before it's run\n+2. Using the official **binary tarball** [⤓ skip to section][install-bin-tarball]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Normal difficulty (full manual setup required)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+3. Using fanquake's **Docker image** [↗︎ external instructions][install-fanquake-docker]\n+   - Maintained by fanquake\n+   - Easy (automatically performs *some* setup)\n+   - Works on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+4. Using a **distribution-maintained package** [⤓ skip to section][install-distro-pkg]\n+   - Maintained by distribution's Guix package maintainer\n+   - Normal difficulty (manual setup required)\n+   - Works only on distributions with Guix packaged, at time of writing:\n+     - Debian Bullseye or later\n+     - Ubuntu Hirsute or later\n+     - Arch Linux (via AUR)\n+   - Installs a release decided on by package maintainer\n+   - Source or binary installation depending on the distribution\n+5. Building **from source** [⤓ skip to section][install-source]\n+   - Maintained by you\n+   - Hard, but rewarding\n+   - Can be made to work on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any commit (more granular)\n+   - Source installation, requires lower level of trust\n+\n+## Options 1 and 2: Using the official shell installer script or binary tarball\n+\n+The installation instructions for both using the offical shell installer script\n+and using binary tarballs can be found in the GNU Guix Manual's [Binary\n+Installation\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html).\n+\n+Note that running through the binary tarball installation steps is largely\n+equivalent to manually performing what the shell installer script does.\n+\n+Note that at the time of writing (July 5th, 2021), the shell installer script\n+automatically creates an `/etc/profile.d` entry which the binary tarball\n+installation instructions do not ask you to create. However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source.

This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

More information on standard Automake directory variables\n+can be found\n+[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Standard-Directory-Variables.html).\n+\n+However, the Guix init scripts and service configurations for Upstart, systemd,\n+SysV, and OpenRC are installed to launch\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon`,\n+which does not yet exist, and will only exist after `root` performs their first\n+`guix pull`.

If you have already completed the\n+installation and setup, please proceed to [perform a build](./README.md).\n+\n+Otherwise, you may choose from one of the following options to install Guix:\n+\n+1. Using the official **shell installer script** [⤓ skip to section][install-script]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Easiest (automatically performs *most* setup)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Only installs latest release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+   - Note: The script needs to be run as root, so it should be inspected before it's run\n+2. Using the official **binary tarball** [⤓ skip to section][install-bin-tarball]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Normal difficulty (full manual setup required)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+3. Using fanquake's **Docker image** [↗︎ external instructions][install-fanquake-docker]\n+   - Maintained by fanquake\n+   - Easy (automatically performs *some* setup)\n+   - Works on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+4. Using a **distribution-maintained package** [⤓ skip to section][install-distro-pkg]\n+   - Maintained by distribution's Guix package maintainer\n+   - Normal difficulty (manual setup required)\n+   - Works only on distributions with Guix packaged, at time of writing:\n+     - Debian Bullseye or later\n+     - Ubuntu Hirsute or later\n+     - Arch Linux (via AUR)\n+   - Installs a release decided on by package maintainer\n+   - Source or binary installation depending on the distribution\n+5. Building **from source** [⤓ skip to section][install-source]\n+   - Maintained by you\n+   - Hard, but rewarding\n+   - Can be made to work on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any commit (more granular)\n+   - Source installation, requires lower level of trust\n+\n+## Options 1 and 2: Using the official shell installer script or binary tarball\n+\n+The installation instructions for both using the offical shell installer script\n+and using binary tarballs can be found in the GNU Guix Manual's [Binary\n+Installation\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html).\n+\n+Note that running through the binary tarball installation steps is largely\n+equivalent to manually performing what the shell installer script does.\n+\n+Note that at the time of writing (July 5th, 2021), the shell installer script\n+automatically creates an `/etc/profile.d` entry which the binary tarball\n+installation instructions do not ask you to create. However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source.

Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1. Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations. See\n+the last paragraph of this\n+[section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) for more\n+details.\n+\n+Build Guix (this will take a while):\n+```\n+make -j$(nproc)\n+```\n+\n+Install Guix:\n+\n+```\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+### Post-\"build from source\" Setup\n+\n+#### Creating and starting a `guix-daemon-original` service with a fixed `argv[0]`\n+\n+At this point, guix will be installed to `${bindir}`, which is likely\n+`/usr/local/bin` if you did not override directory variables at\n+`./configure`-time. More information on standard Automake directory variables\n+can be found\n+[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Standard-Directory-Variables.html).\n+\n+However, the Guix init scripts and service configurations for Upstart, systemd,\n+SysV, and OpenRC are installed to launch\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon`,\n+which does not yet exist, and will only exist after `root` performs their first\n+`guix pull`. TODO: Link to `guix pull` as root section\n+\n+We need to create a `-original` version of these init scripts that's pointed to\n+the binaries we just built and `make install`'ed in `${bindir}` (normally,\n+`/usr/local/bin`).\n+\n+Example for `systemd`, run as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+# Create guix-daemon-original.service by modifying guix-daemon.service\n+bindir=\"$(dirname $(command -v guix-daemon))\"\n+sed -E -e \"s|/\\S*/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon|${bindir}/guix-daemon|\" /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service > /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+\n+# Make systemd recognize the new service\n+systemctl daemon-reload\n+\n+# Make sure that the non-working guix-daemon.service is stopped and disabled\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon\n+\n+# Make sure that the working guix-daemon-original.service is started and enabled\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl start guix-daemon-original\n+```\n+\n+#### Creating `guix-daemon` users / groups\n+\n+Please see the [relevant\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Build-Environment-Setup.html)\n+in the Guix Reference Manual for more details.\n+\n+## Optional setup\n+\n+At this point, you are set up to [use Guix to build bitcoin](./README.md#usage).\n+However, if you want to polish your setup a bit and make it \"what Guix\n+intended\", then read the next few subsections.\n+\n+### Add an `/etc/profile.d` entry\n+\n+This section definitely does not apply to you if you installed Guix using:\n+1. The shell installer script\n+2. fanquake's Docker image\n+3. Debian's `guix` package\n+\n+#### Background\n+\n+Although Guix knows how to update itself and its packages, it does so in a\n+non-invasive way (it does not modify `/usr/local/bin/guix`).\n+\n+Instead, it does the following:\n+\n+- After a `guix pull`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/current-guix`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.config/guix/current`\n+\n+- After a `guix install`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/guix-profile`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.guix-profile`\n+\n+Therefore, in order for these operations to affect your shell/desktop sessions\n+(and for the principle of least astonishment to hold), their corresponding\n+directories have to be added to well-known environment variables like `$PATH`,\n+`$INFOPATH`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, etc.\n+\n+In other words, if `$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin` does not exist in your\n+`$PATH`, a `guix pull` will have no effect on what `guix` you are using. Same\n+goes for `$HOME/.guix-profile/bin`, `guix install`, and installed packages.\n+\n+Helpfully, after a `guix pull` or `guix install`, a message will be printed like\n+so:\n+\n+```\n+hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:\n+\n+     GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+     . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p \"$HOME/.guix-profile\"'.\n+```\n+\n+However, this is somewhat tedious to do for both `guix pull` and `guix install`\n+for each user on the system that wants to properly use `guix`. I recommend that\n+you instead add an entry to `/etc/profile.d` instead. This is done by default\n+when installing the Debian package later than 1.2.0-4 and when using the shell\n+script installer.\n+\n+#### Instructions\n+\n+Create `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` with the following content:\n+```sh\n+# _GUIX_PROFILE: `guix pull` profile\n+_GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.config/guix/current\"\n+if [ -L $_GUIX_PROFILE ]; then\n+  export PATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"\n+  # Export INFOPATH so that the updated info pages can be found\n+  # and read by both /usr/bin/info and/or $GUIX_PROFILE/bin/info\n+  # When INFOPATH is unset, add a trailing colon so that Emacs\n+  # searches 'Info-default-directory-list'.\n+  export INFOPATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\n+fi\n+\n+# GUIX_PROFILE: User's default profile\n+GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+[ -L $GUIX_PROFILE ] || return\n+GUIX_LOCPATH=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale\"\n+export GUIX_PROFILE GUIX_LOCPATH\n+\n+[ -f \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\" ] && . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+# set XDG_DATA_DIRS to include Guix installations\n+export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}\"\n+```\n+\n+Please note that this will not take effect until the next shell or desktop\n+session (log out and log back in).\n+\n+### `guix pull` as root\n+\n+Before you do this, you need to read the section on [choosing your security\n+model][security-model] and adjust `guix` and `guix-daemon` flags according to\n+your choice, as invoking `guix pull` may pull substitutes from substitute\n+servers (which you may not want).\n+\n+As mentioned in a previous section, Guix expects\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` to be populated with\n+`root`'s Guix profile, `guix pull`-ed and built by some former version of Guix.\n+However, this is not the case when we build from source.

Using the official **shell installer script** [⤓ skip to section][install-script]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Easiest (automatically performs *most* setup)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Only installs latest release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+   - Note: The script needs to be run as root, so it should be inspected before it's run\n+2. Using the official **binary tarball** [⤓ skip to section][install-bin-tarball]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Normal difficulty (full manual setup required)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+3. Using fanquake's **Docker image** [↗︎ external instructions][install-fanquake-docker]\n+   - Maintained by fanquake\n+   - Easy (automatically performs *some* setup)\n+   - Works on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+4. Using a **distribution-maintained package** [⤓ skip to section][install-distro-pkg]\n+   - Maintained by distribution's Guix package maintainer\n+   - Normal difficulty (manual setup required)\n+   - Works only on distributions with Guix packaged, at time of writing:\n+     - Debian Bullseye or later\n+     - Ubuntu Hirsute or later\n+     - Arch Linux (via AUR)\n+   - Installs a release decided on by package maintainer\n+   - Source or binary installation depending on the distribution\n+5. Building **from source** [⤓ skip to section][install-source]\n+   - Maintained by you\n+   - Hard, but rewarding\n+   - Can be made to work on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any commit (more granular)\n+   - Source installation, requires lower level of trust\n+\n+## Options 1 and 2: Using the official shell installer script or binary tarball\n+\n+The installation instructions for both using the offical shell installer script\n+and using binary tarballs can be found in the GNU Guix Manual's [Binary\n+Installation\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html).\n+\n+Note that running through the binary tarball installation steps is largely\n+equivalent to manually performing what the shell installer script does.\n+\n+Note that at the time of writing (July 5th, 2021), the shell installer script\n+automatically creates an `/etc/profile.d` entry which the binary tarball\n+installation instructions do not ask you to create. However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source.

Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1. Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

Using a **distribution-maintained package** [⤓ skip to section][install-distro-pkg]\n+   - Maintained by distribution's Guix package maintainer\n+   - Normal difficulty (manual setup required)\n+   - Works only on distributions with Guix packaged, at time of writing:\n+     - Debian Bullseye or later\n+     - Ubuntu Hirsute or later\n+     - Arch Linux (via AUR)\n+   - Installs a release decided on by package maintainer\n+   - Source or binary installation depending on the distribution\n+5.

However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source.

Using the official **shell installer script** [⤓ skip to section][install-script]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Easiest (automatically performs *most* setup)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Only installs latest release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+   - Note: The script needs to be run as root, so it should be inspected before it's run\n+2. Using the official **binary tarball** [⤓ skip to section][install-bin-tarball]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Normal difficulty (full manual setup required)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+3. Using fanquake's **Docker image** [↗︎ external instructions][install-fanquake-docker]\n+   - Maintained by fanquake\n+   - Easy (automatically performs *some* setup)\n+   - Works on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+4. Using a **distribution-maintained package** [⤓ skip to section][install-distro-pkg]\n+   - Maintained by distribution's Guix package maintainer\n+   - Normal difficulty (manual setup required)\n+   - Works only on distributions with Guix packaged, at time of writing:\n+     - Debian Bullseye or later\n+     - Ubuntu Hirsute or later\n+     - Arch Linux (via AUR)\n+   - Installs a release decided on by package maintainer\n+   - Source or binary installation depending on the distribution\n+5. Building **from source** [⤓ skip to section][install-source]\n+   - Maintained by you\n+   - Hard, but rewarding\n+   - Can be made to work on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any commit (more granular)\n+   - Source installation, requires lower level of trust\n+\n+## Options 1 and 2: Using the official shell installer script or binary tarball\n+\n+The installation instructions for both using the offical shell installer script\n+and using binary tarballs can be found in the GNU Guix Manual's [Binary\n+Installation\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html).\n+\n+Note that running through the binary tarball installation steps is largely\n+equivalent to manually performing what the shell installer script does.\n+\n+Note that at the time of writing (July 5th, 2021), the shell installer script\n+automatically creates an `/etc/profile.d` entry which the binary tarball\n+installation instructions do not ask you to create. However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source. Solutions and workarounds are documented\n+[here](#gnutls-test-suite-fail-status-request-revoked).\n+\n+\n+To install:\n+```sh\n+sudo apt install guix\n+```\n+\n+For up-to-date information on Debian and Ubuntu's release history:\n+- [Debian release history](https://www.debian.org/releases/)\n+- [Ubuntu release history](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)\n+\n+### Arch Linux\n+\n+Guix is available in the AUR as\n+[`guix`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guix/), please follow the\n+installation instructions in the Arch Linux Wiki ([live\n+link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Guix#AUR_Package_Installation),\n+[2021/03/30\n+permalink](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Guix&oldid=637559#AUR_Package_Installation))\n+to install Guix.\n+\n+At the time of writing (2021/03/30), the `check` phase will fail if the path to\n+guix's build directory is longer than 36 characters due to an anachronistic\n+character limit on the shebang line. Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1. Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable.

Using the official **shell installer script** [⤓ skip to section][install-script]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Easiest (automatically performs *most* setup)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Only installs latest release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+   - Note: The script needs to be run as root, so it should be inspected before it's run\n+2.

Using fanquake's **Docker image** [↗︎ external instructions][install-fanquake-docker]\n+   - Maintained by fanquake\n+   - Easy (automatically performs *some* setup)\n+   - Works on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+4. Using a **distribution-maintained package** [⤓ skip to section][install-distro-pkg]\n+   - Maintained by distribution's Guix package maintainer\n+   - Normal difficulty (manual setup required)\n+   - Works only on distributions with Guix packaged, at time of writing:\n+     - Debian Bullseye or later\n+     - Ubuntu Hirsute or later\n+     - Arch Linux (via AUR)\n+   - Installs a release decided on by package maintainer\n+   - Source or binary installation depending on the distribution\n+5. Building **from source** [⤓ skip to section][install-source]\n+   - Maintained by you\n+   - Hard, but rewarding\n+   - Can be made to work on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any commit (more granular)\n+   - Source installation, requires lower level of trust\n+\n+## Options 1 and 2: Using the official shell installer script or binary tarball\n+\n+The installation instructions for both using the offical shell installer script\n+and using binary tarballs can be found in the GNU Guix Manual's [Binary\n+Installation\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html).\n+\n+Note that running through the binary tarball installation steps is largely\n+equivalent to manually performing what the shell installer script does.\n+\n+Note that at the time of writing (July 5th, 2021), the shell installer script\n+automatically creates an `/etc/profile.d` entry which the binary tarball\n+installation instructions do not ask you to create. However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration.

The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations. See\n+the last paragraph of this\n+[section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) for more\n+details.\n+\n+Build Guix (this will take a while):\n+```\n+make -j$(nproc)\n+```\n+\n+Install Guix:\n+\n+```\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+### Post-\"build from source\" Setup\n+\n+#### Creating and starting a `guix-daemon-original` service with a fixed `argv[0]`\n+\n+At this point, guix will be installed to `${bindir}`, which is likely\n+`/usr/local/bin` if you did not override directory variables at\n+`./configure`-time. More information on standard Automake directory variables\n+can be found\n+[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Standard-Directory-Variables.html).\n+\n+However, the Guix init scripts and service configurations for Upstart, systemd,\n+SysV, and OpenRC are installed to launch\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon`,\n+which does not yet exist, and will only exist after `root` performs their first\n+`guix pull`. TODO: Link to `guix pull` as root section\n+\n+We need to create a `-original` version of these init scripts that's pointed to\n+the binaries we just built and `make install`'ed in `${bindir}` (normally,\n+`/usr/local/bin`).\n+\n+Example for `systemd`, run as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+# Create guix-daemon-original.service by modifying guix-daemon.service\n+bindir=\"$(dirname $(command -v guix-daemon))\"\n+sed -E -e \"s|/\\S*/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon|${bindir}/guix-daemon|\" /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service > /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+\n+# Make systemd recognize the new service\n+systemctl daemon-reload\n+\n+# Make sure that the non-working guix-daemon.service is stopped and disabled\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon\n+\n+# Make sure that the working guix-daemon-original.service is started and enabled\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl start guix-daemon-original\n+```\n+\n+#### Creating `guix-daemon` users / groups\n+\n+Please see the [relevant\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Build-Environment-Setup.html)\n+in the Guix Reference Manual for more details.\n+\n+## Optional setup\n+\n+At this point, you are set up to [use Guix to build bitcoin](./README.md#usage).\n+However, if you want to polish your setup a bit and make it \"what Guix\n+intended\", then read the next few subsections.\n+\n+### Add an `/etc/profile.d` entry\n+\n+This section definitely does not apply to you if you installed Guix using:\n+1. The shell installer script\n+2. fanquake's Docker image\n+3. Debian's `guix` package\n+\n+#### Background\n+\n+Although Guix knows how to update itself and its packages, it does so in a\n+non-invasive way (it does not modify `/usr/local/bin/guix`).\n+\n+Instead, it does the following:\n+\n+- After a `guix pull`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/current-guix`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.config/guix/current`\n+\n+- After a `guix install`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/guix-profile`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.guix-profile`\n+\n+Therefore, in order for these operations to affect your shell/desktop sessions\n+(and for the principle of least astonishment to hold), their corresponding\n+directories have to be added to well-known environment variables like `$PATH`,\n+`$INFOPATH`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, etc.\n+\n+In other words, if `$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin` does not exist in your\n+`$PATH`, a `guix pull` will have no effect on what `guix` you are using. Same\n+goes for `$HOME/.guix-profile/bin`, `guix install`, and installed packages.\n+\n+Helpfully, after a `guix pull` or `guix install`, a message will be printed like\n+so:\n+\n+```\n+hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:\n+\n+     GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+     . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p \"$HOME/.guix-profile\"'.\n+```\n+\n+However, this is somewhat tedious to do for both `guix pull` and `guix install`\n+for each user on the system that wants to properly use `guix`. I recommend that\n+you instead add an entry to `/etc/profile.d` instead. This is done by default\n+when installing the Debian package later than 1.2.0-4 and when using the shell\n+script installer.\n+\n+#### Instructions\n+\n+Create `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` with the following content:\n+```sh\n+# _GUIX_PROFILE: `guix pull` profile\n+_GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.config/guix/current\"\n+if [ -L $_GUIX_PROFILE ]; then\n+  export PATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"\n+  # Export INFOPATH so that the updated info pages can be found\n+  # and read by both /usr/bin/info and/or $GUIX_PROFILE/bin/info\n+  # When INFOPATH is unset, add a trailing colon so that Emacs\n+  # searches 'Info-default-directory-list'.\n+  export INFOPATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\n+fi\n+\n+# GUIX_PROFILE: User's default profile\n+GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+[ -L $GUIX_PROFILE ] || return\n+GUIX_LOCPATH=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale\"\n+export GUIX_PROFILE GUIX_LOCPATH\n+\n+[ -f \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\" ] && . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+# set XDG_DATA_DIRS to include Guix installations\n+export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}\"\n+```\n+\n+Please note that this will not take effect until the next shell or desktop\n+session (log out and log back in).\n+\n+### `guix pull` as root\n+\n+Before you do this, you need to read the section on [choosing your security\n+model][security-model] and adjust `guix` and `guix-daemon` flags according to\n+your choice, as invoking `guix pull` may pull substitutes from substitute\n+servers (which you may not want).\n+\n+As mentioned in a previous section, Guix expects\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` to be populated with\n+`root`'s Guix profile, `guix pull`-ed and built by some former version of Guix.\n+However, this is not the case when we build from source. Therefore, we need to\n+perform a `guix pull` as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+sudo --login guix pull --branch=version-<latest-release-version>\n+# or\n+sudo --login guix pull --commit=<particular-commit>\n+```\n+\n+`guix pull` is quite a long process (especially if you're using",

However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source.

Please see [this section]() for\n+instructions on how to add a `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (\"Bullseye\")/Ubuntu 21.04 (\"Hirsute\")\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) (\"bullseye\") and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix) (Hirsute Hippo).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here]()), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building GnuTLS from source.\n+Solutions and workarounds are documented [here]().\n+\n+\n+To install:\n+```sh\n+sudo apt install guix\n+```\n+\n+For up-to-date information on Debian and Ubuntu's release history:\n+- [Debian release history](https://www.debian.org/releases/)\n+- [Ubuntu release history](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)\n+\n+### Arch Linux",

However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+Note that this section is based on the distro packaging situation at the time of\n+writing (July 2021). Guix is expected to be more widely packaged over time. For\n+an up-to-date view on Guix's package status/version across distros, please see:\n+https://repology.org/project/guix/versions\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source. Solutions and workarounds are documented\n+[here](#gnutls-test-suite-fail-status-request-revoked).\n+\n+\n+To install:\n+```sh\n+sudo apt install guix\n+```\n+\n+For up-to-date information on Debian and Ubuntu's release history:\n+- [Debian release history](https://www.debian.org/releases/)\n+- [Ubuntu release history](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)\n+\n+### Arch Linux\n+\n+Guix is available in the AUR as\n+[`guix`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guix/), please follow the\n+installation instructions in the Arch Linux Wiki ([live\n+link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Guix#AUR_Package_Installation),\n+[2021/03/30\n+permalink](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Guix&oldid=637559#AUR_Package_Installation))\n+to install Guix.\n+\n+At the time of writing (2021/03/30), the `check` phase will fail if the path to\n+guix's build directory is longer than 36 characters due to an anachronistic\n+character limit on the shebang line. Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1. Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6399679/125064185-a9a59880-e0b0-11eb-82c1-9b8e5dc9950d.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->",

The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6399679/125064185-a9a59880-e0b0-11eb-82c1-9b8e5dc9950d.png)",
