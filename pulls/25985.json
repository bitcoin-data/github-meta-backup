    "body": "This reverts ee7b84e63cbeadd5e680d69ff0548275581e9241 from #20527.\r\n\r\nThat change was made without any rationale, maybe other than, a brew\r\ninstalled version might be newer, and that's \"better\". However when\r\nbuilding from source on macOS, it just results in drastically worse\r\nperformance, and issues / confusion like #25724.\r\n\r\nThe difference in performance can be observed using the example from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25724#issuecomment-1213554922,\r\nbut minified i.e:\r\n```bash\r\ntime src/bitcoin-cli createwallet speedy true\r\ntime src/bitcoin-cli importdescriptors '[\r\n  {\"desc\":\"raw(00145846369f3d6ba366d6f5a903fb5cf4dca3763c0e)#k9wh6v62\",\"timestamp\":\"now\"},\r\n  {\"desc\":\"raw(001420800aabf13f3a4c4ce3ce4c66cecf1d17f21a6e)#6m0hlfh4\",\"timestamp\":\"now\"},\r\n  {\"desc\":\"raw(0014c6bf9715e06d73ebf9b3b02d5cc48d24d8bbabc1)#wyavh36r\",\"timestamp\":\"now\"},\r\n  {\"desc\":\"raw(00141ba7807b3f46af113beaea5c698428ce7138cd8a)#jctdsups\",\"timestamp\":\"now\"},\r\n  {\"desc\":\"raw(00140c1bd27f10fff01b36ddf3c1febaa1acff19b080)#9s6nc3pk\",\"timestamp\":\"now\"},\r\n  {\"desc\":\"raw(00141226e31987e4bc2e63c0ee12908f675e40464b20)#9pp7qm39\",\"timestamp\":\"now\"},\r\n  {\"desc\":\"raw(0014f73f149f7503960a5e849c6ee7a8a8c336f631cb)#qtkxv9fc\",\"timestamp\":\"now\"},\r\n  {\"desc\":\"raw(0014c8ccb4d81ffc769fc5fdd8d7eed69b0e0cae5749)#hn39qayv\",\"timestamp\":\"now\"},\r\n  {\"desc\":\"raw(001498565aead2d67a22a6021d55210f2a917fc22169)#6ar3vwsx\",\"timestamp\":\"now\"},\r\n  {\"desc\":\"raw(001403013248ac0cd9eabe176cad162cda2a19f771e1)#4m47mukd\",\"timestamp\":\"now\"}\r\n]'\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning master, when building from souce and using brew installed\r\nsqlite, this takes ~3.4s. With this PR, the same operation takes ~0.3s.\r\n\r\nResolves the \"build from source\" portion of #25724. Building from\r\ndepends is still not ideal, however I have some other changes that might\r\nhelp improve things in that case.\r\n\r\nRelated performance issue reports:\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/issues/749\r\n* https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/113898/bitcoin-v23-is-10-times-slower-than-v22-on-macos-for-basic-regtest-tests\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25724\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25985#issuecomment-1245942400",

However the general case still seems to be that the brew libs are either the same speed, or much slower than the system libs.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen an argument for always prefering the brew libs, and in that case you're just rolling the dice for much worse performance, and ending up with #25724.\r\n\r\nNote that the benchmarking can also be performed without using `brew` at all. You can just compare a build with system libs, vs a depends build, as [sqlite as compiled via brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/b2381b8146258ea40e08b634fd693defdd957748/Formula/sqlite.rb#L32), is going to be ~the same as the lib you get when compiling in depends.\r\n\r\nLooking at the macOS sqlite system lib, it's pretty clear that it contains code that isn't in the open source sqlite. There are a number of additional symbols, including `__sqlite3_apple_archive, __sqlite3_apple_archive_type, __sqlite3_apple_unarchive, __sqlite3_purgeEligiblePagerCacheMemory` etc. As well as `_sqlite3_key, _sqlite3_key_v2`, which indicate the presence of non-free sqlite extensions, such as [The SQLite Encryption Extension](https://sqlite.org/com/see.html).",

Homebrew just [compiles the unmodified sqlite source](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/sqlite.rb), there is nothing to \"fix\" there.

If we actually had those changes, we could also be applying them in depends (and fixing this for releases).\r\n\r\n> If users want to use Apple's sqlite, they can use the same approach. No code change is required at all.\r\n\r\nSo you suggest we leave this as-is, and just continually tell downstream projects / confused devs that to get reasonable performance in their developer environments, they have to compile differently, and avoid homebrews sqlite, even though our build system is setup to prefer it by default?\r\n\r\nHere's another instance of a project, this time BDK, running into this same problem: https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/issues/749.",

The original example was larger and took 30 seconds vs 3 seconds. The problem is also that downstream software which imports many descriptors may run into RPC client timeouts (although arguably that's a problem with their RPC client). Also this performance issue effects other things too, although they are less directly measurable.",
