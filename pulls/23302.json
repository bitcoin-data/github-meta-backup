    "body": "The tracepoint `validation:block_connected` was introduced in #22006.\r\nThe first argument was the hash of the connected block as a pointer\r\nto a C-like String. The last argument passed the hash of the\r\nconnected block as a pointer to 32 bytes. The hash was only passed as\r\nstring to allow `bpftrace` scripts to print the hash. It was\r\n(incorrectly) assumed that `bpftrace` cannot hex-format and print the\r\nblock hash given only the hash as bytes.\r\n\r\nThe block hash can be printed in `bpftrace` by calling\r\n`printf(\"%02x\")` for each byte of the hash in an `unroll () {...}`.\r\nBy starting from the last byte of the hash, it can be printed in\r\nbig-endian (the block-explorer format).\r\n\r\n```C\r\n  $p = $hash + 31;\r\n  unroll(32) {\r\n      $b = *(uint8*)$p;\r\n      printf(\"%02x\", $b);\r\n      $p -= 1;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also: #22902 (comment)\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change to the block_connected tracepoint API, however\r\nthis tracepoint has not yet been included in a release.",

Printing data this way works great for fixed sized pieces of data, but you can't unroll on passed arguments.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar enough with BPF bytecode but I assume there is just no \"jump\" operation to implement loops, which is why you need to unroll them.",
