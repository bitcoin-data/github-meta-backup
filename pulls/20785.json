      "body": "> The Bitcoin Core dependencies for production builds are pegged and are unlikely to ever be using the latest versions of a 3rd party library.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what pegged means in this context ? I assume delayed ?\r\n\r\n> The Visual Studio build is not used in production and is provided for developer convenience only. When doing a Visual >Studio build on the Appveyor CI platform the dependencies, including libevent, are installed using Microsoft's vcpkg.\r\n\r\nOk good to know this. I also tried and use the vcpkg. However I don't know yet exactly how that works and the bitcoind source code I am trying to compile is compiling against the latest libevent source code pulled straight from git by myself.\r\n\r\nSo I am still in the process of trying to get bitcoind compiling and linking and ran into this. Perhaps later I would have switched to this vcpkg... it was said on some website that vcpkg is maintained by Microsoft and such... no idea how far that lags behind with latest version.\r\n\r\n> The version is pegged by checking out a specific version of the vcpkg port files. Currently libevent is at `2.1.12`.\r\n\r\nAgain not sure what pegged means in this context ? (I am not native english person, but dutch :), I tried a dictionary but can't really understand the meaning of this word pegged)\r\n\r\n> Which libevent version are you having a problem with and what's the warning or error you're getting?\r\n\r\nI am using latest git source code for libevent. I am not exactly sure how to check the version number, neither on git nor ok vcpkg. I dont know yet exactly how to use vcpkg. I tried some install and some, it did seem to hang bash a little bit, so I am not even sure if it installed properly. I may have to get some kind of libevent library working later.\r\n\r\nThe change log for libevent seems out of date. The version mentioned in there is 2.1.8-stable (22 January 2017)\r\n\r\nCould you advise me how to figure out the exact version of libevent ?\r\n\r\nWhich version of libevent would be needed to compile and link for bitcoin ?",
