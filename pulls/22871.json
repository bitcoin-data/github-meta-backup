However at the time that `CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` was implemented, there were was at least one parasitic protocol (Counterparty? Colored coins? I'm sorry I forget which) using `nSequence` for other purposes, and in production too IIRC. They wanted to be able to continue doing what they were doing without interruption, and having `SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG` be available for them was the compromise--meaning that it was critically important that setting this flag *not* result in their transactions being excluded from the mempool.\r\n\r\nNow I haven't seen anyone use `nSequence` for anything else since then, but then I don't keep up to date on all the projects in this space. Maybe someone should scan the blockchain and see if `SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG` has even been used in the past 6 years?",

Of course, we could reuse the Taproot annex field to encode such transaction field extension but that would a bit of the waste as we might have those 4 bytes not used.\r\n\r\nThat said, see my comment, I think we should be far more conservative on the procedural side. This is a strong *tightening* of our policy which might have safety implications for some class of Bitcoin software. I think one step could be just to move to full-rbf, announce the `nSequence` field is now reserved and then reject any transaction with a bit set in the remaining ones ? Maybe better than subtle relay restrictions based on `nSequence` bits patterns. \r\n\r\nEDIT: imo this change should combine well with full-rbf",

      "body": "I agree this isn't a simple patch and see given the risks, but note it is *policy*, so transactions can still be valid in consensus and this behavior could be e.g. conf file disabled safely. I think most discussion should be on the mailing list.\r\n\r\nI have actually been sitting on a draft email on the full RBF stuff, letting it stew before I stick my nose in that. The basics of my thought process is that we should really only be using comitted transaction data for consensus purposes, not to signal mempool policies. This would also let us get rid of the annoying RBF 0xfffffffe and 0xfffffffd check since those have no consensus meaning. So I'm for it from a 'unfuck the code' perspective.\r\n\r\nI think one point that's also worth noting is that there are two different standardness rules here, one applies to transaction nSeq the other to script CSV argument. The policies can (and do in this PR) differ.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to merge something like this early in the release cycle (to signal it is going to be released, giving people time to complain) and potentially even activate the standardness rule as a flag day or go full BIP-9 if there is a strong worry about it. It's a standardness flag, not consensus, so we can do whatever we want. But we should be sure that people have time to complain. The only thing I don't want to happen is for someone to see this issue, and then start using nSequence in a way that would limit the upgradability because they can. That would be annoying, so I think we'd want to ensure any arguments are presented in good faith (with e.g. testnet or mainnet examples of the behavior being used before we act). ",

      "body": "To be clear, the original code isn't a mistake. BIP68-disabled nSequence values are very purposefully allowed by the IsStandard rules. nSequence was always intended as a client-interpreted field to be used when merging or updating transactions, and therefore it would be expected to take on unexpected values. However as we all know this original naive idea didn't work and it took a combination of BIP68 consensus rules and RBF mempool policy to actually implement a useful form of transaction replacement in the mempool. At this time nSequence took on consensus meaning, but there was a lot of push back from 3rd party protocol developers who were already treating nSequence as a 4-byte-per-input private use field. Thus `SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG` was added, and in a way that very purposefully did not impact non-consensus use of nSequence.\r\n\r\nThat said, bitcoin is now twice as old as when this decision was made. Does anyone actually use nSequence for non-consensus purposes anymore? If not, then this patch makes some sense.",

      "body": "The original code *is* a mistake IMO since the upgradable semantics issue isn't just in tx relay, but also in the stack values permitted to be passed to CSV. As a brand new opcode, the semantics there can be totally different from the nSeqeuence value in the transaction (e.g., when Disable is set we could add a rule to check a sequence lock in the taproot annex). To underscore that the differing semantics exist: `0x80000000 CSV` script can be used with any txin.nSequence you like.\r\n\r\nAnd as @darosior points out on the mailing list, Lightning does use 0x80<junk>, so we need to accomodate that.

      "body": "This PR covers both nSeqeunce and <arg> CSV which are distinct. It would mean that whatever new script semantics applied to the unused portions of the CSV argument would have to then also require that transaction version 3 is used. However, there's not really a sound way that we can specify which transaction version for CSV semantics we are requiring at output creation time (e.g., v2 or v3) so we have to be proactive about fixing that case in my opinion. Concretely, suppose we said if bit 24 is set require tx version == 3, that would be a new consensus rule applying to things that could have been previously happening on tx version == 2, so if we're ever to make use of the unused bits in CSV for any consensus reason we should do this.\r\n\r\nWith respect to nSeqeunce itself, I think I agree that the semantics could be done separately for tx version 3 vs version 2. However, if we are going through the trouble of fixing CSV upgradability, it seems reasonable to me to fix both.",

      "body": "I'm mostly repeating what other people said, but implementing this change for nSequence means that Bitcoin Core won't relay transactions with this bit set. Wallet and application devs may have written software under the assumption that non-consensus usage of nSequence (specifically the disable locktime flag) won't affect transaction propagation. This assumption has been true for the past few years, but would now suddenly be broken. Thus, it seems unsafe for users if we change this tx relay policy out from underneath them without putting more effort in coordinating with other projects in the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nI also don't think the right solution would be to carve out exemptions for each application using bit masks. It makes the interface unnecessarily complex and harder for everyone to work with.\r\n\r\nwrt the hypothetical upgrade to relative timelock semantics, I don't feel convinced that the other approaches brought up by other contributors (gating on a higher nVersion, repurposing new opcode, using annex, etc.) aren't adequate options. There seems little value in making this change for OP_CSV arguments. I also have a comment about the approach below.\r\n\r\nI agree that it would be unsafe to try to deploy a consensus change to upgrade the relative timelocks gated on the disable locktime flag now. I appreciate that you've brought attention to this, but it seems like a more appropriate solution is to document it and make sure we don't do the unsafe thing, instead of doing an additional unsafe thing just in case we want to do the other unsafe thing in the near future.",

Note, such weird range of bits could be a protocol watermark such as the Lightning obscured commitment number in commitment transactions.\r\n\r\nFurther, I've a second wonder about this discouraging effectiveness w.r.t to hypothetical future semantic. If we assume the upgrade semantics to be well-designed, they will set bit31 to disable bip69 semantic. Doing so, if they need more than the 14 uninterpreted bits, they might reuse the interpreted ones to encode their new field ? If they do so, the SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_MASK bits might be set and not catch by this discouraging check.\r\n\r\nI think those wonders express a trade-off, if we make this discouraging check more efficient to better preserve upgradeability, we're increasing the risk to silently the broadcast of any Bitcoin software interpreting `nSequence` for a special purpose ?",
