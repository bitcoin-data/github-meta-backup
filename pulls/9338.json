Telegram perhaps? https://telegram.me/rebroad\r\n\r\nOk, on 2nd thoughts I might have been overly enthusiastic raising this PR, as I realise that it won't work well in some situations, e.g. when connecting to too few peers but I do think that the advantage of github is the collaboration, and therefore it can be more efficient to advertise work in progress as several heads can sometimes find solutions sooner than one. At least, this is how I understand the process working.\r\n\r\nAnyway, from some perspectives I may have jumped the gun. Should I close this until it's more developed then?",
