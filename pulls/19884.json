      "body": "> @dhruv I saw you removed the `done` logic: are you sure that `!addrman.empty()` is _guaranteed_ after `addrman.Add(convertSeed6(Params().FixedSeeds()), local);`? AFAICT that condition must be hold for the new code to be equivalent to the old code.\r\n\r\n@practicalswift Thank you for catching that. I overlooked the implication of the `static` qualifier on `done` and mistakenly thought the code was redundant. It is now added back in.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the `done` logic is used to make sure that `addrman.Add(convertSeed6(Params().FixedSeeds()), local);` gets called no more than once regardless of the outcome. When I followed the code in `CAddrMan`, it seems that the invocation just adds the fixed seeds to the address tables so long as the seeds are well-formed. So invoking the deterministic function more than once is unnecessary. I'm new around here, so I'm hoping you can confirm my understanding.",

There is a `setmocktime` RPC often used in the functional tests, and a `-mocktime=<n>` config option that could be passed an `extra_arg` to `start_node`, but AFAICT neither one will have any effect and I'm not sure it's worth changing the code to be more testable unless you have an elegant way to do it or it could be generalized and useful elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA couple of nit comments follow; you can ignore them unless you need to retouch for other reasons.",

The linked issue doesn't really provide a reason why this use case is worthwhile, as far as I can see, just that the filer thought it was surprising.\r\n\r\nThe only case I can see where you'd want to set `-dnsseed=0` is if you somehow don't have DNS despite being connected to the real internet, or if you're really worried about privacy. But if you're really worried about privacy, connecting to fixed seeds is probably worse than doing a dns query, and if you were doing something clever, like triggering an outbound/inbound connection to your own node, losing the 60 second delay might also drop privacy.",

The linked issue doesn't really provide a reason why this use case is worthwhile, as far as I can see, just that the filer thought it was surprising.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I would call removal of a 60 second sleep an optimization. To me it is clearly a bug fix :)\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that the behaviour is unchanged if `-dnsseed=0` is not set.\r\n\r\nThe only effect of this change is that users of `-dnsseed=0` won't have to wait an extra 60 seconds for their node to start.\r\n\r\nGiven the above clarification: do your skepticism to this bug fix remain? :)",

I should have written \"You don't want to use clearnet at all and you don't trust exit node operators\" :)\r\n\r\nAh, and are thus only connecting to the ~89 fixed seeds with onion addresses, and not going via exit nodes at all? That makes more sense.\r\n\r\nI think that currently, if you do `-onlynet=onion -listen=0 -dnsseed=0 -addnode=mytrustedpeer.onion`,  and you successfully connect to mytrustedpeer.onion within 60 seconds, you won't add the fixed seeds (your addrman will contain mypeer.onion rather than being empty), whereas with this change you will add the fixed seeds. Not sure that's a change for the better?\r\n\r\nPerhaps rather than a time check, it would be better to check for something like \"if addrman is empty, there are no ADDR_FETCH nodes left to try, no open connections and no added nodes to keep trying\" ?\r\n\r\nOTOH, if it is a change for the better, it might make sense to move the add fixed nodes code to its own function, and call it from ThreadDNSAddressSeed directly (after trying all the dns seeds, with addrman still empty, and only after the opencon thread as processed any ADDR_FETCH nodes that got queued up), and from CConnman::Start when  `-dnsseed=0` and addrman is empty. That way you avoid unnecessary waiting in all cases, I think.\r\n\r\n(edit: ADDR_FETCH not oneshot)",

      "body": "My apologies for the delay in response. I needed to study all the ways seeding is done before I felt like I could have an opinion. I audited the code and found 6 ways `addrman` grows. I want to document them here for future readers. Reviewers well-versed in seeding can skip to the next section.\r\n\r\n### Peer seeding sources\r\n1. `-connect=node`: If the user runs the node in this configuration, `bitcoind` will only ever make outbound connections with nodes specified in `-connect`. It will still send `getaddr` messages to them and `addrman` will grow, but no other outbound connections will be made. `-dnsseed` and `-listen` are disabled unless overridden by the user.\r\n2. `peers.dat`: `addrman` flushes to `peers.dat`. When not in `-connect` mode, the node will use it's pre-existing knowledge of possible peers from `peers.dat`. Each peer will be queried using `getaddr` and `addrman` will grow further.\r\n3. `-dnsseed`: defaults to true. Uses some domain names owned by Bitcoin contributors to expand the peers in `addrman`. Domains can be found in `CMainParams`. If `-proxy` is set, or if the domain does not support `x9.domain` (which tests for `NODE_NETWORK | NODE_WITNESS`), `getaddr` messages are sent to the dns seed itself as a peer. i.e. connections are of type `ADDR_FETCH` to an address like `dnsseed.emzy.de`. Otherwise (and this is mostly the case), DNS _resolved_ addresses are used as peer candidates in `addrman`. So, sometimes, DNS seeds act as seednodes (eg. `-proxy`) requiring a further `getaddr` message, and sometimes, they directly dns resolve to peers which support `NODE_NETWORK | NODE_WITNESS`.\r\n4. `-seednode=node`: User-specified `ADDR_FETCH` connections. \r\n5. `-addnode=node`: Like `-connect`, except when `addrman` grows, new outbound peers will be established. (This won't happen if `-connect` is also specified).\r\n6. Fixed seeds: If all else fails, there are hardcoded seeds in `chainparamsseeds.h` that the node can try to seed peers from. It's important to have a good definition of \"when all else fails\".\r\n\r\n### Continued PR discussion\r\n- `-connect` is not relevant as seeding does not really matter in that case.\r\n- We are solving for the case when `peers.dat` is empty\r\n- We are solving for the case when `-dnsseed=0`\r\n- That leaves us to deal with `-seednode` and `-addnode`\r\n\r\n@ajtowns has made a great observation that in the case that `-seednode` or `-addnode` are provided, removing the 60 second delay before trying the fixed seeds makes it so that we are relying on a last-resort mechanism before giving the nodes in `-seednode` and `-addnode` a chance to help us grow `addrman`. I've updated the code to reflect this. We will now try to use fixed seeds when:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-connect is not provided\r\n\r\nAND peers.dat is empty\r\n\r\nAND ((-dnsseed=0 AND all_ADDR_FETCH_processed AND -addnode=[]) OR 60 seconds have passed)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives DNS seeds(ADDR_FETCH), -seednode connections(also ADDR_FETCH) and -addnode peers 60 seconds to help us find peers IF they are specified. Note that we explicitly need to check if `-dnsseed=0` even though it may seem like `all_ADDR_FETCH_processed` covers that case. This is because when `-dnsseed=1`, `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` will add ADDR_FETCH connections almost instantaneously, but `ThreadOpenConnections` may check this condition before the DNS seeds are added. \r\n\r\n@ajtowns Please note that I was not able to do this:\r\n> OTOH, if it is a change for the better, it might make sense to move the add fixed nodes code to its own function, and call it from ThreadDNSAddressSeed directly (after trying all the dns seeds, with addrman still empty, and only after the opencon thread as processed any ADDR_FETCH nodes that got queued up), and from CConnman::Start when -dnsseed=0 and addrman is empty. That way you avoid unnecessary waiting in all cases, I think.\r\n\r\nbecause I don't understand how we decide we are giving up on `-addnode` manual connections being able to grow `addrman` without a timeout (in this case, 60 seconds).\r\n\r\nThis PR is ready for re-review.",

If you want to disable that because you're doing `-addnode` later via RPC, you could specify `-dnsseed=0 -seednode=127.0.0.1`, though perhaps adding a `-fixedseeds=0` param would be better.\r\n\r\nI think the argument for removing the timeout is just that if you end up adding fixed seeds, the entire time before you did that is wasted because you weren't able to connect to the p2p network (if you _were_ able to, you wouldn't have ended up adding the fixed seeds), so rather than waste people's time, just make the decision earlier.\r\n\r\nI think that's probably better behaviour for the edge cases too -- if you're doing `-addnode` to a trusted peer in order to avoid untrusted seeds, then you probably don't want to fall back to the untrusted peers if you happen to not be able to connect to your trusted peer in the first minute of trying.",

      "body": "Thank you, for the review and for taking the time to teach me via your branch, @ajtowns.\r\n\r\nI've added a new command line flag: `-fixedseeds`. A user can run `-dnsseed=0 -fixedseeds=0` and then issue a `addnode` RPC to satisfy the use case @luke-jr mentioned. `-dnsseed=0 -fixedseeds=0 -addnode=X` will provide the trusted peer only behavior @ajtowns mentioned. I also added a functional test. \r\n\r\nI definitely see the appeal of not having any wait, but I chose not to split up adding fixed seeds into `CConnman::Start` and `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` yet. If the user runs `-dnsseed=0 -seednode=X` or `-dnsseed=0 -addnode=X`, `CConnMan::Start` will not add fixed seeds, and `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` will not run at all. Then, in case the node at X is unreachable/censored, our node would never fall back to fixed seeds. This would be a departure from how things work today as fallback to untrusted peers is the default behavior. Perhaps we can allow for the trusted-peer-only behavior using `-dnsseed=0 -fixedseeds=0 -addnode=X`, but not impose it? In addition, `-connect` already provides a similar and more limited option. If other reviewers also agree that we should default to the trusted-peer-only behavior, I am open to changing it.\r\n\r\nThe changes to use chrono for feelers are included in #20044 and nicely bundled with other chrono types, so I did not include it.\r\n\r\nReady for further review.",
