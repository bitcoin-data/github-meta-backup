Use assertions instead.\r\n\r\nNote to reviewers:\r\n* Some of these redundant checks might be indications of logical bugs in the existing code. If so they should be solved separately. Let me know if you spot such cases.\r\n* Although these conditions are known to be true in some cases we might have good reasons for doing a redundant check for documentation purposes or other reasons. Let me know if you think so.\r\n* Some of the assertions might be overkill since the preceding code trivially implies what we assert. The `fMaster` is such a case.\r\n\r\nFeedback welcome :-)",

In particular, if any one of these assertions in consensus code aren't guaranteed by the preceding code they can cause network wide DOS and consensus failure. so it must be reviewed carefully even if the review is simple.   MarcoFalke's point that they make the code more brittle against refactoring is also worth keeping in mind.\r\n\r\nIn general we do want to include assertions in places where incorrect execution could cause an RCE or what not, but we need to take pretty good care that they don't introduce crashes where otherwise things would run fine.",

Aside from the issue around the way we use asserts in this project (which we could probably document better for contributors in the developer notes, if anyone is up for it!), I generally think the review effort for minor changes to consensus critical code is not worth it unless we're achieving some larger goal than code cleanup, like a bugfix, new feature, or a refactor in support of future new feature.  I think code comments are a much better way to explain consensus code that is correct but doesn't look pretty, as there is much lower review burden for doc-only PRs, and we can achieve a similar effect of making the code more understandable to a future reader.",
