    "body": "# Introduction\n\nThe getutxo command allows querying of the UTXO set given a set of of outpoints. It has a simple implementation and the results are not authenticated in any way. Despite this, there are times when it is a useful capability to have. I believe @jgarzik also has a use case for this, though I don't know what it is.\n\nAs a motivating example I present Lighthouse, an app I'm writing that implements assurance contracts:\n\nhttp://blog.vinumeris.com/2014/05/17/lighthouse/\n\nLighthouse works by collecting _pledges_, which contain an invalid transaction signed with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. Once sufficient pledges are collected to make the combination valid, we say the contract is complete and it can be broadcast onto the network, spending the pledged outputs. Before that occurs however, a pledge can be _revoked_ and the pledged money redeemed by double spending the pledged output. For instance you might want to do this if it becomes clear not enough people care about the assurance contract for it to reach its goal in a timely manner, or if you simply need the money back due to some kind of cashflow crunch. \n\nIt is convenient to be able to see when a pledge has been revoked, so the user interface can be updated, and so when the final contract is created revoked pledges can be left out. For this purpose \"getutxos\" is used.\n# Protocol\n\nThe getutxos message takes a boolean which controls whether outputs in the memory pool are considered, and a vector of COutPoint structures. It returns a bitmap with the same number of bits as outputs specified rounded up to the nearest 8 bits, and then a list of CTxOut structures, one for each set bit in the bitmap. The bitmap encodes whether the UTXO was found (i.e. is indeed unspent).\n# Authentication\n\nThe results of getutxos is not authenticated. This is because the obvious way to do this requires the work maaku has been doing on UTXO commitments to be merged, activated by default, miners to upgrade and a forking change made to enforce their accuracy. All this is a big project that may or may not ever come to fruition.\n\nFor the Lighthouse security model however, this doesn't matter much. The reason is that the pledge transactions you're getting (which may be malicious) don't come from the P2P network. They come in the form of files either from a simple rendezvous server, or e.g. a shared folder or email attachments. The people sending these files have no way to influence the choice of peers made by the app. Once the outputs are returned, they are used to check the signatures on the pledge, thus verifying that the pledge spends the UTXO returned by the P2P network.\n\nSo we can be attacked in the following ways:\n- The pledge may be attempting to pledge non-existent outputs, but this will be detected if the majority of peers are honest.\n- The peers may be malicious and return a wrong or bogus output, but this will be detected when the signature is checked, except for the value (!) but we want to fix this by including the value into the sighash at some point anyway because we need it to make the TREZOR efficient/faster.\n- The peers may bogusly claim no such UTXO exists when it does, but this would result in the pledge being seen as invalid. When the project creator asks the pledgor why they revoked their money, and learns that in fact they never did, the bogus peers will be detected. No money is at risk as the pledges cannot be spent.\n- If the pledgor AND all the peers collaborate (i.e. the pledgor controls your internet connection) then they can make you believe you have a valid pledge when you don't. This would result in the app getting \"jammed\" and attempting to close an uncloseable contract. No money is at risk and the user will eventually wonder why their contract is not confirming. Once they get to a working internet connection the subterfuge will be discovered.\n\nThere is a final issue: the answer to getutxos can of course change the instant the result is generated, thus leading you to construct an uncloseable transaction if the process of revocation races with the construction. The app can detect this by watching for either a reject message, or an inv requesting one of the inputs that is supposed to be in the UTXO set (i.e. the remote peer thinks it's an orphan). This can then cause the app to re-request the UTXO set and drop the raced pledge.\n\nIn practice I do not anticipate such attacks are likely to occur, as they're complicated to pull off and it's not obvious what the gain is.\n\nThere may be other apps that wish to use getutxos, with different security models. They may find this useful despite the lack of UTXO commitments, and the fact that the answer can change a moment later, if:\n- They are connecting to a trusted peer, i.e. localhost.\n- They trust their internet connection and peer selection, i.e. because they don't believe their datacenter or ISP will commit financial fraud against them, or they are tunnelling via endpoints they trust like a randomly chosen Tor exit.\n- They are not using the response for anything important or worth attacking, like some kind of visualisation.\n# Upgrade\n\nIf enforced UTXO commitments are added to the block chain in future, it would make sense to rev the P2P protocol to add the proofs (merkle branches) to the response.\n# Testing\n\nI attempted to write unit tests for this, but Core has no infrastructure for building test chains .... the miner_tests.cpp code does it but at the cost of not allowing any other unit test to do so, as it doesn't reset or clean up the global state afterwards! I tried to fix this and ended up down a giant rabbit hole.\n\nSo instead I've tested it with a local test app I wrote, which also exercises the client side part in bitcoinj.\n# BIP\n\nIf the code is ACKd then I will write a short BIP explaining the new message.\n# Philosophy\n\nOn IRC I have discussed this patch a little bit before. One objection that was raised is that we shouldn't add anything to the P2P protocol unless it's unattackable, because otherwise it's a sharp knife that people might use to cut themselves.\n\nI personally disagree with this notion for the following reasons. \n\nFirstly, many parts of the P2P protocol are not completely unattackable:  malicious remote nodes can withhold broadcast transactions, invent fictional ones (you'd think they're orphans), miss out Bloom filter responses, send addr messages for IP's that were never announced, etc. We shouldn't hold new messages to a standard existing messages don't meet.\n\nSecondly, even with UTXO commitments in the block chain, given the sick state of mining this only requires a collaboration of two people to undo, although that failure would be publicly detectable which is at least something. But anyway, there's a clean upgrade path if/when UTXO authentication becomes available.\n\nThirdly, we have a valid use case that's actually implemented. This isn't some academic pie in the sky project.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin is already the sharpest knife imaginable. I don't think we should start rejecting useful features on the grounds that someone else might screw up with them.\n\nIf the above analysis ends up not holding for some reason, and people do get attacked due to the lack of authentication, then Lighthouse and other apps can always fall back to connecting to trusted nodes (perhaps over SSL). But I would like to optimistically assume success up front and see what happens, than pessimistically assume the worst and centralise things up front.\n",

      "body": "> Pledges are not public. You're making assumptions about the design without understanding it.\n\nEither pledges are public information and can be attacked, or they are not and some single user is running the crowdfund, (the project owner) in which case the overhead of just using existing systems is not a big deal. In particular, in the \"single project owner design\" all pledges can easily be added to a single bloom filter and the chain scanned to keep the state of spent/unspent up to date at the same low cost as keeping an SPV wallet up-to-date. (remember that users are going to be pledging specific amounts and/or using a specific wallet for their pledges, so in the vast majority of cases you'll need to create a transaction output for that pledge, which means the bloom filter behavior is identical to that of a standard SPV wallet)\n\nRelying on pledges not being public information for your security is a rather risky design with difficult to predict consequences. Easy to imagine, for instance, a user publishing a list of pledge amounts showing the progress of their campaign, and that list being used for the attack. (trick project owner into publishing an invalid tx with an input spent, record signatures, then make it look like other pledges are now spent and get more pledges)  Even a \"multiple utxo's is one pledge\" design can easily fall to an attacker who just guesses what UTXO's are probably part of the pledge based on amounts pledged. Again, all attacks that are much more difficult to pull off if the app isn't giving away exact info on what transaction outputs it's looking for. (although UTXO anonymity does suffer from the inherent problem that UTXO size grows indefinitely, so your k-anonymity set is much weaker than it looks as many entries can be ignored due to old age - another argument for the bloom filter alternative)\n\n> Your second statement is nonsensical. The code does return \"the UTXO data associated with the UTXO\", what else would it do?\n\nIt can return only a spent/unspent bit. What's the use-case for requiring more than that? It's easy to foresee this encouraging applications to abuse the UTXO set as a database. (back to the policy question: do we really want to redefine NODE_NETWORK as being able to provide UTXO data to peers as well?)\n",

Talking of testing, if you cannot integrate testing into the unit tester suite for some reason I think at least some Python script should be included in `qa/...` to be able to test this functionality. Such a test script could create a node, import a bootstrap file, and launch `getutxos` queries at it.\n\nI think we are at the point that we need to define an extension mechanism - whether that's done with a `NODE_*` bit or some other way doesn't matter. That would encourage experimentation, and I think this is an excellent use-case for such. No need to force all `NODE_NETWORK` nodes above a certain version to provide a specific query service. Alternative implementations (obelisk, btcd) may or not want to implement this, and may want to experiment with their own extensions. Then the bootstrapping network needs a way to find only nodes that provide a certain extension. Let's not repeat the bloom debacle.\n",

      "body": "@laanwj I suggested awhile back we use a simple bitmask:\n\n```\nx0000000000000001.testnet-seed-mask.bitcoin.petertodd.org\n```\n\nReturning all seeds with at least NODE_NETWORK set. There's most likely to be a relatively small number of combinations people use, so DNS caching will still work fine. (though I'm no DNS expert) Of course, as always relying heavily on seeds is foolish, so just setting up app-specific seeds probably makes more sense in many cases and lets the authors of those apps implement whatever feature tests they need to ensure they're serving up seeds that actually support the features required by the apps. (e.g. right now if there ever exist NODE_BLOOM-using nodes on the network and someone does a bloom IO attack against the nodes returned by the seeds, maliciously or by accident, you'll easily wind up with only NODE_BLOOM-supporting nodes being returned, breaking anything relying on bloom filters)\n\nAlso, as an aside it'd be reasonable to set aside a few service bits for experimental usage, with an understanding that occasional conflicts will be inevitable. In my replace-by-fee implementation that uses preferential peering to let replace-by-fee nodes find each other quickly I have:\n\n```\n// Reserve 24-31 for temporary experiments\nNODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE = (1 << 26)\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/blob/f789d6d569063fb92d1ca6d941cc29034a7f19ef/src/protocol.h#L66\n",

      "body": "I don't think the attack you have in mind works.\n\nLet's assume that pledges are public for a moment, e.g. because the user chooses to publish them or collect them in a way that inherently makes them public, like people attaching them to forum posts. I don't fully get what attack you have in mind, but I think you're saying if you can control the internet connection of the fundraiser for an extended period of time, you could ensure they don't close the contract as early as possible and continue to solicit pledges. Then Dick Dasterdly steps in, takes all the pledges and steals the excess by working with a corrupt miner.\n\nBut this attack makes no sense. If the pledges are public any of the legitimate pledgors can also observe the contracts state and close it. The attacker has no special privileges. Unless you control the internet connection of _all_ of them simultaneously and permanently, the attack cannot work: legitimate users will stop pledging once they see it's reached the goal and then either close it themselves, or ask the owner via a secure channel why they aren't doing so. \n\nWhat you're talking about is only an issue if the pledges are NOT public, but the attacker is able to obtain them all anyway, AND control the users internet connection so they do not believe the contract is closeable AND they continue to solicit funds and raise money. Given that Lighthouse includes an integrated Tor client and can therefore tunnel through your control anyway, I don't think this is a realistic scenario.\n\n> It can return only a spent/unspent bit. What's the use-case for requiring more than that?\n\nIt's explained in the nice document I wrote above, please read it! Then you would actually know what data is returned and why.\n\n@laanwj As far as I know only Peter thinks Bloom filtering was a debacle: if we had added a service bit, all nodes on the network would set it except for one or two that don't follow the protocol properly anyway, so who knows what they would do. If a node doesn't wish to support this simple command they can just not increase their protocol version past 90000. If they do, it should be only a few lines of code to add. As you note, using a service bit means implementations can be found but there are only a handful of them to go around, and not using a service bit means some entirely new mechanism must be designed which is way out of scope for this patch.\n\nRe; qa tests, as far as I can tell they are only capable of covering the JSON-RPC interface. We don't seem to have any testing infrastructure for doing P2P tests except for the pull tester. I could try adding some code to that, but that code is maintained in the bitcoinj repository.\n",

      "body": "OK, I can add a service bit, although AFAIK nobody actually has any code that searches out nodes with a particular bit? I'm not sure Core does and bitcoinj definitely doesn't. But that can be resolved later.\n\nThe question of optionality in standards is one with a long history, by the way. The IETF has a guide on the topic here:\n\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2360#section-2.10\n\nDeciding when to make features optional is tricky; when PNG was designed, there were (iirc) debates over whether gz compression should be optional or mandatory. The feeling was that if it were optional, at least a few implementations would be lazy and skip it, then in order to ensure that their images rendered everywhere PNG creators would always avoid using it, thus making even more implementations not bother, and in the end PNGs would just end up bigger for no good reason: just because a few minority implementors didn't want to write a bit of extra code. So they made gz compression mandatory. Another feature that GIF had (animation) was made optional and put into a separate MNG format (later another attempt, APNG). Needless to say, the situation they feared did happen and animated images on the web today are all GIFs.\n\nSo I will add a service bit, even though this feature is so trivial everyone could implement it. If it were larger and represented a much bigger cost, I'd be much keener on the idea. As is, I advise caution - simply making every feature from now on optional is not necessarily good design. The tradeoffs must be carefully balanced.\n",

There's always some reason not to agree with a change, it could be some perceived risk, disagreement on the feature set or how the interface should look, or even paranoid fantasies.\n\nHaving optional features could mean the difference between something like this, which is useful but not absolutely perfect, being merged, or nothing being done at all. So I also advice caution on trying to push it to the entire network with a version bump.\n",

Sometimes those disagreements will make sense, and other times they will be bike shedding. \n\nIf we look at projects like the kernel, it's successful partly because Linus lets debates run for a while, he develops opinions and then if things aren't going anywhere he steps in and moves things forward. Bitcoin has worked the same way in the past with @gavinandresen doing that, and I hope we will retain good project leadership going forward.\n\nGavin, what are your thoughts on protocol extensibility / optionality?

      "body": "We've talked about it, and I'm sure you're aware of my opinion already, but\nI'll still repeat it here to offer for wider discussion.\n\nI do not believe we should encourage users of the p2p protocol to rely on\nunverifiable data. Anyone using 'getutxos' is almost certainly not\nmaintaining a UTXO set already, and thus not doing chain verification, so\nnot able to check that whatever a peer claims as respond to getutxos is\nremotely meaningful. As opposed to other data SPV clients use, this does\nnot even require faking PoW.\n\nYes, there are other parts of the protocol that are largely unverified.\nAddr messages for new peers, the height at startup, requesting the mempool\ncontents, ... But those are either being deprecated (like the height at\nstartup), or have infrastructure in place to minimize the impact of false\ndata. In contrast, I do not see any use of getutxos where the result _can_\nbe verified; if you're verifying, you don't need it. To the extent\npossible, Bitcoin works as zero-trust as possible, and I believe improving\nupon that should be a goal of the core protocol.\n\nOf course, that does not mean that the ability to request UTXO data is\nuseless. I just don't believe it should be part of the core protocol.\n\nI think the problem is that in some cases, there are very good reasons to\nconnect to a particular (set of) full node, and trusting its responses. For\nexample, when you have different Bitcoin-related services running within a\n(local and trusted) network, connected to the outside world using a\nbitcoind \"gateway\". In this case, you are using bitcoind as a service for\nyour system, rather than as a pure p2p node.\n\nSo far, we have separated service providing done through RPC than through\nP2P. This makes often sense, but is not standardized, is not very\nefficient, and is inconvenient when most of the data you need is already\ndone through P2P.\n\nMy proposal would therefore be to add \"trusted extensions\" to the P2P\nprotocol. They would only be available to trusted clients of a full node\n(through IP masking, different listening port, maybe host authentication at\nsome point, ...). I've seen several use cases for these:\n- When a local network wallet rebroadcasts transactions, you want the\n  gateway to rebroadcast as well. Default current behavior is to only relay\n  the first time you see a transaction.\n- You want local clients to bypass rate limiting systems, without\n  triggering DoS banning (currently done for localhost, whuch is broken for\n  Tor).\n- Some functionality really is only available when you have a trusted\n  bitcoind. Mempool acceptance checking for detecting conflicting wallet\n  transactions is one, getutxos is another. Mechanisms for these could be\n  available but only to trusted clients.\n\nThis may be controversial (and probably needs a separate\nmailinglist/issue), as it could all be done through a out of band separate\nnon-P2P protocol, or just RPC.\n\nComments?\n",

      "body": "@sipa +1\n\nThere's nothing wrong with trust. We'd like everything to be decentralized, but we don't live in a perfect world so occasionally we introduce trust to solve problems that we don't have decentralized solutions for yet. We did that in the payment protocol because we had no other way to authenticate payments; we should be doing that in UTXO lookup, because we have no other way to authenticate UTXO's. (yet)\n\nWe also have a responsibility to design systems that naturally lead to safe implementations that are robust against attack. This patch is anything but that on multiple levels - even little details like how it gives you 100% unauthenticated UTXO data rather than just a \"known/unknown\" response encourage inexperienced programmers to take dangerous shortcuts, like relying on your untrusted peer(s) for utxo data corresponding to a tx rather than at least getting actual proof via the tx and its merkle path to the block header. (PoW proof) Equally the presence of vulnerable targets encourages attackers to sybil attack the Bitcoin network to exploit those targets - we don't want to encourage that.\n\nThat said, I'm not convinced we need to add trusted extensions to the Bitcoin Core P2P protocol; that functionality already exists in the form of Electrum among others. UTXO's can be looked up easily, you can authenticate the identity of the server you're talking to via SSL, and it is already used for that purpose by a few applications. (e.g. the SPV colored coin client ChromaWallet) A client implementation is simple(1) and Electrum supports things like merkle paths where possible to reduce the trust in the server(s) to a minimum. Why reinvent the wheel?\n\n1) https://github.com/bitcoinx/ngcccbase/blob/master/ngcccbase/services/electrum.py\n",

      "body": "I have a section in the commit message about philosophy for a reason - this discussion is now firmly in the realm of the philosophical.\n\nThere have been cases in the past few years where people loudly proclaimed that something should not be done because of $ATTACK or $CONCERN, then we did it, and so far things worked out OK. A good example of this was SPV clients in general, a few people said:\n- Nodes will silently drop transactions just because they can, so every client should use a trusted server.\n- People will DoS the network by requesting lots of blocks just because they can, so Bloom filters should be disabled by default (litecoin did this)\n- People will sybil the network and make clients believe in non-existent mempool transactions, so everyone should just use a trusted server.\n\nIn fact none of these things have happened, the concerns were overblown. Will they happen in future? Maybe! But also maybe not. So far we benefited tremendously: pushing SPV forward was the right call.\n\nWhen any change is proposed it's natural and human to immediately come up with as many objections as possible. The reason is, if we object now and something does go wrong, we can make ourselves look smart and wise by saying \"told you so\". But if we object and nothing goes wrong, people usually forget about it and move on. This gives a huge incentive to consider only risks and not benefits, it gives huge incentives to try and shoot things down. Sometimes people call this stop energy, a term coined by Dave Winer: http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy - I see it here. Nobody above is talking about the considerable benefits of a fully decentralised assurance contract app. Instead people are focusing only on costs, costs like \"maybe someone will do something dumb\", which is always a concern with Bitcoin.\n\nNow there are two possible outcomes here:\n\n1) Although I have explained why various attacks are not a concern above, let's say my analysis is wrong somehow and someone finds a way to exploit the lack of block chain authentication on getutxos and causes problems for my users. Let's also say that other ways to fix the problem, like using Tor and cross-checking nodes don't work. In that case I will have to fall back to using a set of trusted nodes instead and people can say \"told you so\". I'm sure they will enjoy it.\n\n2) In fact the concerns are overblown and nobody mounts successful attacks, either because it's too hard, or because there's no benefit, or because by the time someone finds a way to do it and decides they want to the world has moved on and e.g. we have UTXO commitments or simply Bitcoin assurance contracts are irrelevant for some reason.\n\nIn the latter case, it's a repeat of Bloom filtering so far - we will have benefited! More decentralisation! More simplicity!\n\nThe argument being made here is, let's just assume failure and skip straight to the centralised trust based solution. Or more subtly, let's set up a hypothetical straw developer who we assume does something dumb, and use that as a reason to not add features.\n\nI have a different idea - let's add this feature and see what happens. Maybe it turns out to be useless and people get attacked too much in practice, in which case it would fall out of use and in future could be removed from the protocol with another version bump. Or maybe it works out OK, eventually gets extended to contain UTXO proofs despite the lack of real-world attacks, and the story has a happy ending.\n",

      "body": "This doesn't appear incompatible with the txout set encryption.  The idea there is to key the utxo set with some hash of the txid:vout and encrypt the data with some different hash of the txid:vout, thus the node itself does not have the data needed to decrypt the txout until the moment its needed.  Since this would provide the txid's it would still work even if it returned the data... though for the motivation of the encrypted txouts we might prefer to not receive the txid until strictly needed, and instead do query by hash for this kind of spendability.\n\nThat said, I consider serving additional unauthenticated data strongly inadvisable. It risks incentivizing sibyl attacks against the network and we've already seen people (apparently) trying to attack miners in the past with nodes lying about the time— so these kinds of attack are not just theoretical. We should be moving in the opposite direction in the core protocol, not making it worse. And if we do provide facilities which are not necessary for the basic operation of the system they should be behind service flags so we have the freedom to abandon them later without instantly breaking any node that calls them.\n\nTrusted services are already offered by electrum nodes— which have authenticated and encrypted connections and a curated node database which may prevent sybil attacks, at the expense of a more centralized dependency— which should be acceptable here, since the argument was that the data doesn't need to be authenticated at all.  Why can't this use the existing electrum infrastructure for quasi-trusted wallet data?\n\nIs the mempool bool really the right design? ISTM that nodes that want to know if the txout is confirmed or mempool is going to need to query all of them twice.\n",

      "body": "My +1 goes to both @sipa and @mikehearn on this. This is a trusted call, and we are giving people enough rope to shoot themselves in the foot. Ideally stuff like this should be disabled by default and/or placed behind a special authenticated connection. But that is a separate issue necessitating a separate pull request -- this gets my ACK once best block hash & height is addd.\n\nWhen I first heard about this at the conference I thought this was crazy -- we need to be implementing trustless mechanisms for these things! If there is a usecase now, then let that drive development on, e.g. UTXO commitments, and let's do this the right way. I still feel that way generally. However in this particular case I am more than willing to make an exception: Lighthouse will be transformative to bitcoin development, and is exactly the ideal platform for crowdfunding work on trustless tech. So I'm okay with merging this now, and reaping the benefits for bitcoin while also working on all the improvements mentioned.\n\nThe UTXO commitments I'm working on are currently developer-time limited. There's a working Python implementation and complete test vectors, as well as an optimized commitment mechanism (#3977, which needs a rebase), and C++ serialization code for the proofs. All we need is the C++ code for updating proofs, and the LevelDB backend. So if there are other bitcoind hackers out there interested in doing this The Right Way, contact me. However it requires a soft-fork, so rolling it out necessitates some degree of developer consensus, community eduction, and miner voting process (or the beneficence of ghash.io...), all of which together requires as much as a year if past experience is a judge. Lighthouse, on the other hand, can do good for bitcoin crowdfudned development right now.\n\n@gavinandresen It is only temporarily the case that the full UTXO set is something every full node needs to know. With either TxO or UTxO commitments it becomes possible to prepend spentness proofs to block and transaction propagation messages, at which point nodes are free to drop (portions of) the UTXO set. There is consensus we are heading in a direction which enables this, just not consensus over TxO vs UTxO and the exact details of the data structure.\n",

You don't have hordes asking for this feature; and if people are asking for this feature, it is easy to point them to an existing project that can roll this out instantly.\n\n(Because, remember, you cannot start using this functionality even if you merge the PR today)\n",

      "body": "@jgarzik Using insight for this seems overkill, as it needs no extra indexes - bitcoind has the required information ready. If this would have been a request to add a private RPC call instead of a public P2P network message, IMO it would have been an easy ACK.\n\n@sipa\n\n> I don't disagree at all that it is useful. I even gave an extra use case for it (mempool conflict checking). I just want to not make the distinction between the p2p system and services offered by full nodes fuzzier.\n\n@gmaxwell \n\n> We should be moving in the opposite direction in the core protocol, not making it worse. And if we do provide facilities which are not necessary for the basic operation of the system they should be behind service flags so we have the freedom to abandon them later without instantly breaking any node that calls them.\n\nRight, that was my idea as well. It can be useful but if you want to offer these kind of 'courtesy' services, they should be separate - either behind a service bit or such or a separate network like Electrum. Not mandatory extensions that the Bitcoin P2P network is stuck with forever.\n(as you say, can't remove features you have introduced with a version: all existing software will interpret >=version as 'has this and this feature' no matter what is specified later). \n\nAs @maaku says, `NODE_NETWORK` already is a hack that conflates different 'services'. I'd prefer to make this part of a new service and add a `NODE_QUERIES` bit or such.\n",

      "body": "It does not make sense to run a full blown block explorer for something that all bitcoind's can serve without any additional indexes.\n\n@drak There is no danger to people's money. Have you read my original post or the analysis above? Even if you disagree for some reason, you just .... don't run an app that uses the message. \n\n@maaku Thanks, it's nice to see someone weigh the potential benefits too. I'll try and make some time to test/play with your UTXO commitments work in future.\n\nI do not believe adding such messages is \"going in the wrong direction\". Telling people to pick some trusted people and trust them is the wrong direction. This is the same reasoning by which we'd have no SPV clients at all because some theoretical attack exists, so we should all just use Electrum and presumably if one or two Electrum server operators turn out to be corrupt, we ask governments to regulate them? Or remove them from a magic list and wait until they come back under another identity? Am I supposed to ask Electrum operators to submit to an exchange-style passport examination? Or just assume because I met the guy in a bar once and he seemed OK he must be trustworthy? I don't think \"use Electrum\" is quite the silver bullet it's being made out to be. Actually I suspect that randomly picking a few nodes out of 8000 (especially via a Tor circuit using one of their ~1000 available exits) and cross checking their answers stands just as good a chance of being robust.\n\nAdditionally, let's be realistic about what UTXO commitment authentication in this context really means: we have something close to a miner cartel today. If we assume that nodes are untrustworthy and it's the proofs that matter, then those proofs could be mis-generated by a grand total of two or three people; hardly a quantum leap in trustlessness. UTXO proofs make sense on the assumption we can fix the mining market though, so we should still optimistically do them.\n\nNow, look, there's genuine and reasonable disagreement here. But we should all be willing to consider the idea that we're wrong. I faced that possibility above:  if attacks happen, then I will have to rewrite things to use some trusted nodes (probably bitcoin p2p tunnelled over SSL to nodes either run by myself, or by people I know). So I know what my plan is. But if you're against this feature, what if _you_ are wrong? What if the attacks don't happen? Then you have made a real Bitcoin app less decentralised, and set a powerful precedent that nobody should propose new features for Bitcoin unless every imaginable risk can be mitigated, including risks borne by developers who haven't come along yet. This practically ensures nobody ever tries to make the protocol better. That's a big cost we should take very seriously.\n\nAnyway, I'm encouraged enough by support from Gavin and Mark that I'll go ahead and add the height/block hash to the message. I've already added the service bit so I think that meets what @laanwj wants. When the code is merged I'll write the BIP.\n",

      "body": "@sipa made a great point above in that getutxos is fundamentally even worse than bloom filters in terms of trust because there is absolutely no security at all. At least CMerkleBlock's have strong assurances that a given transaction exists even if there's no current way to know if you've seen all transactions. (which incidentally is something we can even reasonably good assurance for via random sampling without a soft-fork) Similarly it's knowledge that only gets better every time you connect to an honest node, even after connecting to a [dishonest one](https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/commit/48949a2a69802d099e67cd8936d362e8977bf66c) - the set of transactions you know about and block headers you know about can only be added too.\n\ngetutxos doesn't have any of that assurance. There's no proof what-so-ever and there's no way to reconcile conflicting responses. You can handwave and say you'll cross check answers, but that's assuming you even have a set of nodes to randomly pick from - you don't. Fundamentally your root of trust in this design is the DNS seeds you started to learn nodes from. Compromise those nodes and your SPV will never learn about an honest node and your screwed. But unlike Electrum because there is no authentication _anywhere_ in the P2P network not only are you trusting that root of trust, you're trusting your ISP, you're trusting Tor exit node operators, etc. It gets even worse when you remember that \"compromising\" the DNS seeds can mean nothing more than just running a few dozen fast nodes and DoS attacking the other nodes so yours end up at the top of the DNS seed lists.\n\nThe whole rant about \"What do you do if an Electrum node operator is dishonest?\" is particularly bizarre: obviously you update the software to stop using that node. It'll happen once in a while, it'll be detected, and you have a very clear and simple procedure to follow if it does. That's why Electrum itself has a config screen that lets you pick what node(s) you want to trust. (and cross-checks them too) Just like Tor it relies on the fact that the operators of the service are well known. (incidentally, over half the Tor bandwidth is provided by people/organizations the Tor project knows, and that's a number that's watched carefully)\n\nWhy are we wasting our time on this very insecure design with no privacy? Electrum already exists, use it in the short term. As for the long term @maaku or someone else will finish a proper authenticated solution and we can add a secure NODE_GETUTXO service. Heck, the saddest part of all this is the use-case initially presented - Lighthouse - simply doesn't need NODE_GETUTXO and would work perfectly well using bloom filters as I explained above.\n\nThe success of Bitcoin's decentralization is based on cryptographic proof, not blindly trusting strangers.\n",

      "body": "@jgarzik Yes it is obvious how NODE_NETWORK is defined now and in the past, but going forward it's less clear what services a full node should offer. Or even what a \"full node\" is. Internally it needs to verify UTXOs but that doesn't mean it needs to offer that capability to random other nodes on the network.\nIt could be said that a full node, to maintain the network\n- needs to verify transactions and blocks before forwarding them\n- serves blocks to bootstrap other nodes\n\nAll kinds of extra services for (SPV) clients are less clear-cut. And even these two could in principle be separate, for example a node could decide to stop serving blocks after a bandwidth quotum has been filled. That's why NODE_NETWORK is a hack. It says what the node _is_, but what other users of the network really want to know is _what services does it offer_ (hence \"service bits\" not \"identity bits\").\n",

It is not a hack, it is very specific.\n\nFolks are attempting to redefine it as a hack, simply because the model of lumping all new features under NODE_NETWORK is not sustainable moving forward.\n\nAnyway, this is semantics, moving on, to a more on-topic issue:\n\nThere is clearly a desire to generalize the P2P network.  Make it a network with a forest of nodes, each of which carrying somewhat-bitcoin-related services.  But, e.g., remote querying of the UTXO set is clearly _not_ needed for bitcoin operation.\n\nTherefore, this proposal smells similar to others, which attempt to turn the bitcoin P2P network into a general decentralized-money-and-query-services network.

Probably I'm missing the point of putting it directly in the protocol.\n\nBeing accepted directly in the protocol (maybe with plans of extending it later with additional proofs), it rises the question of the version number vs service bits vs service strings vs service strings with their own version or whatever...\nBut that's not something unique to this PR and I think the mailing list is more appropriate for that discussion.\n",

Localized queries are fine by me.\n\nIt is adding the query to the P2P network without thinking it through that is the problem.\n\nETA:  I have a similar use case @mikehearn auctions: https://github.com/jgarzik/auctionpunk   It has the same problem:  You make a pledge (sign a transaction), but it might be double-spent away etc. by the end of the auction.  You do indeed need to query the UTXO.  I would never add such query facility to the P2P network, though.\n",

      "body": "We're going around in circles now. @jgarzik Re: Insight - as already pointed out, it makes no sense to run a full blown very expensive block explorer just for access to the UTXO set. I know it's made by your employer but it's really just not relevant here at all.\n\nThis is not a major change to the network, that's melodramatic. It's a tiny patch. It may not match with your personal vision of what the network should be in future, but the Bitcoin protocol has always been about whatever is needed for a decentralised financial system: remember that in the early days it not only had the current functions (including distributed network status alerts), but also had the foundations of an entire P2P marketplace in it!  Not to mention that SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY and other unused features were obviously put there for a reason. This idea that the network should be as minimal as possible and we should rely on trusted third parties for everything else is very much the newcomer here; that's not how the project has historically operated.\n\nWe have a more fundamental and deeper rooted problem here. Bitcoin cannot operate anymore as a consensus driven project because some people (like @petertodd) reliably object to everything they did not invent and others like to say \"no\" to anything that anyone can possibly imagine a better solution for, regardless of whether that other solution exists or will be implemented in any reasonable time. \n\nIndeed, anyone reading this thread would correctly conclude that this community does not have ANY coherent vision of what Bitcoin should become.  \n\nFor this reason the only decision I really care about here is that of @gavinandresen. Someone needs to (re)set a clear vision and set of technical principles, then absurd threads like this one can be avoided in future.\n",

If you wish to participate in an open source project, you are going to have to suffer through opinions other than your own.\n\nIgnoring 100% of @petertodd 's messages in this thread, even ignoring my own, there are plenty of valid criticisms you are just handwaving away.\n\nThis belongs on the mailing list.  It is obviously not an easy ACK.\n\nIt is a very strong candidate for closing this PR, until discussion happens on the list and consensus is reached there.\n",

You're welcome to copy the preferential peering code from my replace-by-fee branch so those nodes can find each other more easily. Do this and perhaps in the future it will be easier to get consensus in the future among the whole community that this is in fact a good idea, particularly if the mechanism gets widespread use. It'd be easy to implement the even more general txindex lookup that I recall you wanting before as a NODE_TXINDEX service in that fork too. It'd also make it easier to implement things like proof-of-passport to (perhaps) give some assurance that your peers for these services aren't sybil attacking you - all things that can easily be done in a fork you're leading the development of.\n",

      "body": "@drak I have not handwaved, I have given careful analysis of why I think this change is fine, and why I feel the risk is low enough to make an attempt worthwhile. The proposed alternatives are not better. They are merely the same thing but less decentralised, on the assumption that the approach I'd like to try will fail. \n\nDo you have a _specific_ concern with my analysis?\n\nIf you are concerned about the lack of miner authentication then great, please help @maaku with his project, as that's a big task and he could use the help. But also please understand the basic counterargument: perfect is the enemy of the good, and at any rate given the state of the mining market \"perfect\" in this case is very far from actually being perfect.\n\nNote that we're going to have this exact same discussion again in a month or two anyway when floating fees is integrated. SPV nodes need to find out what the fees are. There's a low(er) trust way, but it's a big project, so the first pass will probably just be \"poll the peers and average\". The same objections will come up, the same arguments will be made. So we need to get this out of our system at some point - might as well be now.\n",

(e.g. reality keys, multiple colored coins projects, mastercoin, counterparty, coinkite, dark wallet, paypub, etc.) You might as well criticize Gavin for not writing enough apps in his new role as Chief Scientist.\n\nre: competing: I was thinking of sybil attacking testnet in the near future with the bloom data hiding attack.

      "body": "Alright, so go sybil attack a tiny network without touching your DNS seed then. What are you trying to prove? That attacking small networks is cheap? You could outmine the testnet quite cheaply too, thus rendering UTXO proofs also irrelevant. Nobody disputes that attacks are possible if someone puts enough effort in, the difference between us is that the observation that:\n\na) The gains are not obvious, so in reality nobody is incentivised to do it and so far nobody has. If your \"incentive\" is to win a pissing match on a github thread, that doesn't tell us much about the behaviour of the system over the long term, does it?\n\nb) The main Bitcoin network is quite large and so attacking it takes a fair amount of resources, quite possibly more resources than the benefit, which as above, is often unclear anyway.\n\nAnyway, this is a waste of time. Yes, we know attacks exist. They always have. Demoing one in a test environment doesn't show us much. What helps is practical experience from the real world, and adaptation to real attacks.\n\nLet me rephrase my question:  as this feature costs nothing, why don't you go advise others not to use it, and let their products compete on decentralisation and security instead?  Seems like the simplest resolution of your complaint.\n",

I'm sure developers can come to their own conclusions, as they have done many times already.\n\n@drak It's not ad hominem to point out that Peter doesn't write apps, even he agrees with that statement. Now, I asked you for _specific_ concerns that have not already been brought up and addressed; do you have any? The only remaining concern that is unaddressed is \"some developer might use it without understanding it simply because it's there\", but I can't address that because we're arguing about the behaviour of hypothetical people who aren't here to say otherwise. It's also an argument so vague it could be invoked for all of Bitcoin, and would hold, but that's no reason not to build Bitcoin.\n\nAnyway, I'm not going to argue this any further. I think all possible aspects of this have been explored by now. No successful open source project is run by having random people turn up and vote on every change, ultimately there must be a chain of command.\n",

Querying the UTXO database is quite cheap (by design) so it does not pose more DoS risk than the other P2P protocol messages. It doesn't pose more of a privacy leak to the node operator than for example the \"mempool\" message.\n\nAlso it is behind a service bit now, so node implementations are not forced to implement this call if they don't want to, for whatever reason. \n\nBut I don't think it warrants this cry-out about insecurity. It can be used in insecure ways, sure, but on the other hand it's possible to shoot yourself in the foot with bitcoin in lots of ways already...\n",

I would consider prepending the tx.nVersion and block height fields to the response (using VarInt serialization for minimal size), for two reasons. First, the nHeight lets you look up the transaction with a bloom filter request, as mentioned. Second, adding both tx.nVersion and nHeight _prior_ to the output itself future-proofs the response against a later hard-fork change of the serialization format -- I have code lying around somewhere that modifies the serialization primitives to take CChainParams and nHeight as parameters for exactly this reason, to enable serialization changes in a future hard-fork.\n",

      "body": "@laanwj The commit description already explains what has to be done to make it what I think you're asking for i.e. authenticated by miners (which let's face it, is not hugely meaningful at the moment). But as I explained it requires UTXO commitments, a huge upgrade to all of Bitcoin. The pull request you're asking for is in reality a large series of complex pull requests and upgrades that would take according to @maaku at least a year, assuming the work is completed at all. Hence why this patch works the way it does.\n\nI do feel like most things brought up so far were discussed in the commit description. It's not like this patch lacks authentication because I hate security. But large amounts of code have a cost. That's why I'm working on assurance contracts in the first place - as a way to help us raise the money for large, complex, expensive projects like UTXO commitments.\n",

      "body": "I don't think that's a fair assessment of the issue here. Doing getutxos the \"proper\" way involves at least a few more months of work on UTXO commitments, then an equally lengthy discussion period where we build consensus among developers, and finally the very lengthy process of convincing miners to follow through with a soft fork, one which causes mining pool software to take a considerable performance hit in validating shares. The proper way is going to be a long and arduous process.\n\nIn the meantime, there are applications such as Lighthouse which need this capability now. The message is unauthenticated and therefore dangerous if you don't know what you are doing -- just like many other p2p messages! -- but @mikehearn does a good job in the OP of laying out what those risks are and how to avoid them. We shouldn't be playing nanny with the p2p protocol and blocking or disabling features because people might hurt themselves.\n\nAbout this time next year, I hope that we are having a discussion about depreciating 'getutxos' once that a fully authenticated 'getutxos2' is deployed, using UTXO hash tree commitments. But until then, there is significant good that can be done with this unauthenticated version.\n",

Anyway, getting off-topic, I'll write about that on the mailing list instead of here...\n\n@maaku \n\"I hope that we are having a discussion about depreciating 'getutxos' once that a fully authenticated 'getutxos2' is deployed, using UTXO hash tree commitments. But until then, there is significant good that can be done with this unauthenticated version.\"\n\nSo what's the disadvantage of having a rest getutxo first that is replaced/complemented with a p2p getutxo later as opposed to having 2 versions of the getutxo p2p message?\nMy question is not \"how to solve the potential security problems of using the unverifiable utxo message?\", my question is \"why can't you do this with rest?\".\n",

I'd like to see @petertodd's pull request that added a `NODE_BLOOM` flag revisited for the same reason.\n\nI plan to make a more thorough response on the mailing list, but in short, this is not a feature I'm interested in implementing in `btcd` because it's too insecure as currently proposed for my tastes.  We don't need more services out there requesting data that can be easily faked only to notice months later they're missing a bunch of coins.\n\nEven though the BIP purports to address the security issues, all it really says is \"Yes, this is insecure.  Don't care.\"   In my opinion, the things necessary to make a request such as this secure should be done **first**, before trying to get this easily abused feature merged mainline.\n",

That _does_ let you verify fully, which is why I changed my initial NACK to ACK. Equally in the case of things like CoinJoin, you don't particularly care whether or not a given UTXO is or is not actually spent; all you care about is whether the peer you're going to send a tx too claims it is.\n\n @davecgh NODE_BLOOM is just one of those issues that got broad support, but had a very vocal minority against it. If you like the idea, just give your users a config option to disable bloom filters; advertising NODE_BLOOM is just being nice.\n",

I explained this to Gregory when he emailed me about it but I'll do so again here.\n\nTo fetch a piece of data using this protocol you must upload a hash and an integer, so 36 bytes. You get back whatever the max amount of data is that can be put in an output. Using a standard CHECKMULTISIG output that's more than 36 bytes but not much more, especially if you don't want to destroy the money so need at least one key to be real. \n\nSo to download a file this way you'd end up uploading a significant fraction of what you download. What's more, to fetch data you'd need a file full of COutPoint structures, which would be a significant percentage of the size of the real file itself. At that point you may as well just distribute the real file, or a torrent file or .... basically _anything_ would work better than this.\n\nBut if for some reason someone desperately wants to use the block chain as a file server, they already have a better option. They can just mark their transactions with an OP_RETURN output and then distribute their file URL as a set of block heights, then download the blocks (either Bloom filtered for extra efficiency or just not filtered, seeing as anyone who does this obviously doesn't care about efficiency).\n\nIn short, trying to serve a file with this feature would result in a bizarre hack that was dramatically worse than any other way of storing files, including just using regular block downloads. It's not something that's worth worrying about.\n",

      "body": "@jgarzik So the efficient way to use the UTXO set for storage with getutxos is to create a transaction with a large number of outputs, all storing data, and then increment the vout index to retrieve the data. That technique works even with p2pkh and p2sh outputs. With the 100KB limit on transactions you can get ~3000 P2SH outputs, or 60KB of data, and you can of course also chain transactions to store more than that if needed. It's worth remembering that using the Bitcoin network for data storage has excellent anti-censorship and reliability properties that other methods simply can't replicate. It's _not_ a hack by any means.\n\nA second use-case for getutxos is timestamping. Waiting for a confirmation is highly impractical, so a user-friendly timestamping tool can create an unspendable UTXO and immediately store the txid:vout. When the timestamp needs to be validated later you simply use getutxos to find the blockheight, optionally getting the actual transaction to properly verify it. Again, the improvement for the user is is to avoid reliance on centralized TXO index servers by forcing everyone to be an index server for you.\n",

      "body": "It doesn't, but Peter hates Bloom filtering too remember?\n\nGiven that BitTorrent and other systems exist, I doubt this will ever be a major problem. But if it does become one, UTXOs can be deleted any time the community wants. If you know they're unspendable you can delete them immediately without any coordination with other peers. Given that the point is censorship resistance that'd usually be public broadcasted data anyway, so finding them should not be very hard. If they are spendable, you need a chain fork to do so, but if the weight of such abuse was seriously hurting Bitcoin as a financial system then getting consensus to do that would happen.\n\nPeter is undoubtably now trying to come up with an even more convoluted reason to object. Please, don't. If you're so concerned about abuse today go implement some anti-DoS code and make yourself useful for a change.\n\nAlso please stop repeating this nonsense about what my app does or does not need. Do you really think I'd have bothered if there was no point to it? Saying some app or another doesn't need this feature is correct in an entirely useless nitpicky way, for the same reason nothing \"needs\" Bloom filtering - it can always just download all the data and calculate the answer itself. But then performance would be unusably bad. Back here in the real world, where performance matters, such a feature makes the difference between something being practical or not.\n",

We must be utilitarian about these decisions.\nThe argument for this pull request has been laid out in great detail: it\nmakes possible entirely new services which would be very beneficial to\nbitcoin.

Exactly what form that takes is still uncertain, but there's no reason to limit our options yet, particularly when applications like Lighthouse have good alternatives to using getutxos that can be used while we take the time to better understand the landscape. Equally many of the \"entirely new services\" made possible may not be things we actually want to encourage on Bitcoin.\n\n@btcdrak An good alternative for many of the use-cases where getutxos is reasonably secure - including Lighthouse - would be to have tx rejection messages include information on what inputs have already been spent. The worst that can happen there is your peer rejects the transaction; whether or not they should have is irrelevant as they can always block propagation.\n",

A node can lie both ways about the spentness, though requiring\nthe full txout to be returned makes it more expensive (needs a txindex).\n\nThey also have different use cases. It seems to me that lighthouse really\nonly needs spentness - the full txout data just makes it more expensive to\nlie. Other examples mentioned before (e.g. the fee estimation) only need\nthe txout data, not the spentness.\n\nI think that lumping them together makes it harder to reason about.\n",

Perhaps it needs its own define which is much smaller.\n\nI produced this by using a small script and [btcwire](https://github.com/conformal/btcwire) testnet tx bd1f9401a9c284a04353f925276af62f23f452d297eb2cc582d037064b2a795f, and `getutxo s` requesting outpoint 1 ... 50,000 times (the limit).\n",

      "body": "Yes, that's what I said.\n\nAs CCoin is a fixed size structure and the size of the bitmap is equal to the size of the inputs, just keeping track of the space required to send and stopping if there'd be insufficient space is good enough. We could remove duplicates too but it doesn't seem necessary if there's a simple counter.\n\nWith respect to reverting things - no, reverting any change that someone finds a bug in is not a sane strategy. If we were about to do a major release it'd be different, but then we shouldn't be merging features at all. Applied consistently this strategy would have resulted in every major change to Bitcoin being rejected. Recent example: using this patch I discovered a serious regression in re-org handling that was the result of (I think) headers first. Rolling back all of headers first would have been a mistake for all kinds of reasons, not least of which is that I wasn't intending to find that bug and wouldn't have done so if the buggy code had still been sitting on a branch.\n",

It means if the feature is fixed and merged in again there is one clean merge, one unit. It makes the history much more understandable. From what I can see, we also need more discussion about the rationale of this PR. Clearly there has been a lot of 'hand waving' and not enough research, which when someone actually did, uncovered some pretty nasty issues. Throwing caution to the wind is not right for Bitcoin Core. I still don't see why this isn't done over RPC personally.\n\nLooking at history, other PRs have been reverted pending further investigation, I don't see why this PR needs special treatment.\n",

      "body": "It can just be truncated. The result bitmap is supposed to be the same length as the input query. If it's not then you know the result has been truncated. I don't think any normal client would ever hit this case anyway. Not complicated.\n\nCan we please stop going over the rationale again and again and again? @btcdrak the RPC stack doesn't even try to handle resource usage attacks so your suggestion would make things worse rather than better.\n\n@sipa The patch is implemented in this way for a reason. My app runs the scripts to try and ensure you can sign for the output you are pledging. Because a pledge is not a valid transaction there is no other way to test this: you cannot broadcast it and see what happens (and proxying transactions would just allow clients to get you banned anyway in the current architecture). The assumption is that your network peers (randomly chosen) are not the same as the people sending you pledges. This is a very realistic and reasonable assumption.\n\nBoth of the above things have been explained _multiple times_ over the past few months including _in the description of the patch_. I really don't know what I can do here to make things clearer. Is there a problem with my writing style or something? I get the overwhelming impression this entire community of people comes to strong opinions on my work yet _does not read a word I've written_, and it's unbelievably frustrating.\n\nI will add some more DoS controls to this feature, although we should all remember that Bitcoin Core can be DoSd in lots of different ways - this is hardly changing the status quo.\n",

Don't be surprised if people are reluctant to dig the hole deeper when we don't know if we're ever going to find a ladder out.\n",

I am less grateful that he then ran to reddit and started complaining about how badly unit tested Bitcoin Core is (blame Satoshi for that one, if he must). \n\nI think it's an open question about how such things can be caught in future. Any future change could result in large temporary memory usage without anyone noticing. The lack of any definition for \"large\" makes this harder - as I said, I can't actually make my testnet node crash even when repeating the conditions that were given. So how to find this sort of thing systematically is tricky. Ideally Bitcoin Core would print a warning if its memory usage went over a certain amount, but we don't have that.\n\nOne solution that will definitely NOT work is blaming people for being imperfect programmers. Core has shipped fatal bugs before and will do so again. The right solution is usually to ask \"how can we stop such mistakes systematically\"? \n",

This is a case of developers going mad for features that want which should be happening on another layer of Bitcoin, not the core protocol which should stay pure and focused. I see very little impetus for real implementation work happening apart from odd bugfixes or cosmetic changes, and a lot of \"THE NEXT BIG THING\" spurned by corporations who see Bitcoin as the new payments innovation instead of wanting to protect the integrity, security and values of Bitcoin. I'm a protocol conservative.\n",
