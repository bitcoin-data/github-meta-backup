As a standalone library the libbitcoinkernel should not have to rely on code that handles some of the particulars of process termination. Additionally this moves the remaining usages of the `uiInterface` out of the kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here uses the notification interface to externalize the existing shutdown code from the kernel library. The `fRequestShutdown` global atomic is passed by reference to the `ChainstateManager::Options` to allow for the termination of long-running kernel functions.\r\n",

      "body": "I spent some time reviving my clang-tidy transform plugin which is able to force bubble-ups of fatal errors and decorations of functions which may call them. I'm not suggesting that we use this approach (I mentioned at core-dev that it works but I find it pretty ugly), though it's useful to point out our current shutdown behavior.\r\n\r\nNote that the plugin is self-written, so it's not flawless. It does produce compiling code though, so I have a reasonable amount of confidence.\r\n\r\n[See here for the transform of the current master branch](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/8054f8b204ae30c781768133da7e2b308e5b7ad1).\r\n\r\nA quick guide:\r\n- Any functions/assignments/declarations which may call shutdown is wrapped in a macro like `MAYBE_EXIT`, `EXIT_OR_IF`, etc.\r\n- Any function containing one of those gets a return type of ``MaybeEarlyExit<real_return_type>`` in order to bubble it up the call-stack.\r\n- This repeats recursively until the topmost functions have had their return type modified.\r\n\r\nThis provides an easy way to see whether or not a high-level function may call shutdown from some deeply nested function.\r\n\r\nIt also provides an easy way to see when calls to shutdown are made _without_ returning to the calling function.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the actual result yet at all. I suspect it will [point out several things for us to fix](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1200547867).",

Am I correct when guessing that any added EXIT* macro, and not the BUBBLE* macros are indicating a missing return?\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke Right, the `BUBBLE_UP` is kinda like a cast, it's not so interesting. The others introduce conditional returns to pass any errors back up the stack. So the problem cases are ones where we don't already have that behavior.\r\n\r\nThe main complication comes from the fact that the callstack might look like:\r\n```\r\nvoid foo()\r\n  int bar()\r\n    std::string baz()\r\n```\r\nWhere `baz()` returns a fatal error. The solution implemented here is to wrap everything in a variant:\r\n```\r\nMaybeEarlyExit<void> foo()\r\n  MaybeEarlyExit<int> bar()\r\n    MaybeEarlyExit<std::string> baz()\r\n```\r\nWhere: `MaybeEarlyExit : std::variant<T, FatalError, UserInterrupted>` (and those are simple enum classes)\r\n\r\nSo basically if the call resulted in an error, pass an error type back up immediately rather than a real return value. These [macros are defined here](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/1fb1e7c632ccf5cd9e8a64cccfa490c688e3dbaa) and do that as necessary (you can largely think of them of different notations of try/catch/rethrow). In fact, this model forces that invariant: you get a return value or a fatal error but never both.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[BlockManager::WriteUndoDataForBlock](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/8054f8b204ae30c781768133da7e2b308e5b7ad1#diff-114c2880ec1ff2c5293ac65ceda0637bf92c05745b74b58410585a549464a33fL718) is a good example of correct/incorrect:\r\n- FindUndoPos: potential error caught and passed back up (what callers do with it is a different question)\r\n- UndoWriteToDisk: aborts and returns immediately as needed\r\n- [FlushUndoFile](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/8054f8b204ae30c781768133da7e2b308e5b7ad1#diff-114c2880ec1ff2c5293ac65ceda0637bf92c05745b74b58410585a549464a33fR738): this one is (I believe) an example of a missed return in master that could cause problems with changes like these. Not necessarily this one in particular, but it's clearly not alone. Edit: to be clear, the problem here is that `FlushUndoFile` may call `AbortNode`, but we don't react to that in `WriteUndoDataForBlock`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to proceed. @ryanofsky mentioned maybe fixing them up as part of this shutdown callback effort?",

The fatal errors there seem different than other fatal errors, and the contradict the \"whatever function triggered the error should also return an error code or raise an exception\" documention.\r\n\r\nI would suggest making one (or both) of the following changes to this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Changing `FlushBlockFile` and `FlushUndoFile` to send a different \"flush failed\" notification rather than \"fatal error\". The node's KernelNotifications handler could treat this just like a fatal error to keep current behavior the same. Other applications using libbitcoinkernel might choose to handle the error in a different way for example by sending a notification or trying to free up disk space, rather than shutting down the service right away.\r\n2. Changing `FlushBlockFile` and `FlushUndoFile` to return `[[nodiscard]] bool`, and changing calls to these functions either bubble up the error or have comments about why the error is safe to ignore in that particular context.",

[You can see an example of it here ](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/blob/clang-tidy-shutdown-rebase/src/early_exit.h#L45)to force bubble-up warnings.\r\n\r\nRather than returning `bool`, maybe return a custom `[[nodiscard]]` result type? That way if the caller wants to bubble-up the result, the use-checking bubbles up as well. Of course that starts breaking down as soon as something actually needs its return value, so maybe it's not useful. Just throwing it out there because imo it's neat :)",

Instead of adding multiple functions, it feels like a better approach here might be to encode some common error reasons into an enum and let the user then decide how to handle them.  I don't understand why these abort calls were ignored so far (the code was introduced [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ac94141af0c16161afa68de1c3720f254ae4e12c)).",

      "body": "> Is there really a qualitative difference between the errors?\r\n\r\nI didn't dig into the actual errors, but the qualitative difference here seems to be that the other AbortNode errors actually need to be fatal and should try to shut down to prevent getting into a worse state. But an error flushing state in memory to disk does not need to be fatal, as long the state in memory is kept and can be saved later. There are lots of ways an application could handle a failed flush notification, and I think it would be better to avoid using fatal error callback for any notification that does not have to be fatal.\r\n\r\nThe choice of whether to use separate methods or enums is basically just aesthetic. And I didn't dig into whether these particular flush errors need to fatal or not. I think you can decide what to do here or whether to do anything at all. My reason for suggesting \"flushFailed\" as an alternative to \"nodiscard bool\" was that latter change might be more invasive and require changing more sensitive code.",

If other components that are already depending on the kernel want to share the same interrupt mechanism, they are then free to do that or not to do that.\r\n\r\nI implemented this approach in a branch based of this PR: https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/review.27711.1-edit. \r\n\r\nThe first commit 04ee8f1190dc6712ea053caed0428ff0c70fca85 is the main one which moves the globals in shutdown.cpp into a `kernel::Context::cancel` member that should allow code using libbitcoinkernel to cancel ongoing tasks and interrupt execution.\r\n\r\nThe second commit 6df7bf3adf8f2a683379ed7830c296847ebfcb51 is just an updated version of your first commit 978c05d58cea9f96f2713667663af35b43905701 which passes references to the interrupt object everywhere instead of references to a `std::atomic<bool>`, and calls the object `m_interrupt` instead of `shutdown_requested` and passes it directly to *Manager constructors instead of requiring another field to be filled in the options structs.\r\n\r\nFree to incorporate any of those changes here.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I didn't think about enough is the last commit. I like the shutdown reason enum added there, but I don't think it should be necessary for the kernel to call out to the application cancel it's own execution if it can just call the cancellation object directly. So it might make sense to change that commit a little too in light of the first commit.\r\n",

I don't see why such logic should exist in a standalone kernel library. Do you have a different perspective here?\r\n\r\nYes, I don't think we should do this because it gets in the way of the kernel having a nice and future-proof API.\r\n\r\nI think we both agree that applications using libbitcoinkernel should have a way to cancel long running kernel threads and operations from an outside thread or signal handler. My [branch](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/review.27711.1-edit) provides that functionality though a [`SignalInterrupt`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/cf326d0a42eadff811d466a84cbdd626f39c9d86/src/kernel/context.h#L21-L22) object that sits in the `kernel::Context` struct. By contrast, the [current PR](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commits/a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5) uses a `std::atomic<bool>` object that application needs to initialize itself and pass to the library.\r\n\r\nI think the approach in the branch is better for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- Using an `SignalInterrupt` object instead of an atomic bool provides a more future-proof API. It is true that right now, all the code running in the kernel can just get away with polling a bool every once in a while to decide whether to continue executing. But we don't know that this will be true in the future. If future kernel code wants to use a thread pool or some other asynchronous processing, there should be a way for outside code to _actively_ send an interrupt and cancel that processing, not just passively set a bool and require the kernel to poll for it. Supporting active cancellation should not require a change to the kernel API when we can just define the API in a general way without reference to `std::atomic<bool>` right now.\r\n\r\n- The API in the branch is friendlier than the API in the PR. Adding the interrupt object to the kernel::Context struct is nicer than requiring the application to initialize the interrupt object itself. Not every application needs to cancel kernel operations (bitcoin-chainstate.cpp is one example) so requiring those applications to declare an atomic shutdown variable adds boilerplate and complexity. You could address this by moving the atomic bool into kernel::Context. But even with that change I still think SignalInterrupt interface is cleaner than the atomic bool interface.\r\n\r\nI understand the approach in the PR makes kernel a littler smaller and lightweight, but to me overhead of depending on CThreadInterrupt, TokenPipe, SignalInterrupt, and unistd.h does not seem high enough to worry about. Also, whatever overhead there is here is an implemention detail of the kernel, and can be changed later. It's not something that's hardcoded into the kernel API.",

I think it boils down to: A fatal error should not necessarily have to trigger an interrupt for all kernel operations.\r\n\r\nYes, this is definitely a goal. Libbitcoinkernel should try to be a library, not an application or application framework. It should have a convenient way of cancelling operations and not force everything to use one shutdown variable.\r\n\r\nBut both the current PR and my branch do already support this. The main difference between the PR and branch is that the PR uses a `std::atomic<bool>` object, while the branch uses a `SignalInterrupt` object.\r\n\r\n> Going back to this earlier remark again, you declared the `m_interrupt` member in your branch as `const`. Do you think it is a bad idea to mutate it from within the chainman to forego a call to `StartShutdown`?\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily bad, but it would be nice to avoid it. It would be cleaner if interrupt state cleanly represented whether a cancellation was requested or not, and wasn't also used to handle the `-stopatheight` and `-stopafterblockimport` corner cases.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I was thinking of suggesting dropping the last commit a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5 from the current PR, and leaving the two `StartShutdown()` calls in place for now. I think a better approach than calling `StartShutdown()` or calling `m_interrupt()` in those cases would be to just return \"finished\" or \"success\" status codes. Also in both cases, it would be better if the kernel wasn't deciding itself whether to return early, but instead asked the application through std::function callbacks. I.e. there could be a std::function callbacks for \"I just a new chain tip, should I keep processing or return early?\" that would be more general than having hardcoded `-stopatheight` logic in the kernel. The third \"FailedConnectingBestBlock\" shutdown case also seems like it should be returning a real error code to the application and calling fatalErrror, not just sending a shutdown notification.\r\n",

      "body": "> Also in both cases, it would be better if the kernel wasn't deciding itself whether to return early, but instead asked the application through std::function callbacks. I.e. there could be a std::function callbacks for \"I just a new chain tip, should I keep processing or return early?\" that would be more general than having hardcoded -stopatheight logic in the kernel. \r\n\r\nHow about making `startShutdown` return a boolean then that can be interpreted by calling code to either terminate the function or continue?\r\n\r\n> The third \"FailedConnectingBestBlock\" shutdown case also seems like it should be returning a real error code to the application and calling fatalErrror, not just sending a shutdown notification.\r\n\r\nAgreed.",
