Use a new setting in settings.json file, notifypolicy which is 0 by default (restricted) and can be set to 1 (unrestricted)\r\n\r\nI am not sure if people will agree to make these changes so workaround is to just document the security recommendation. I understand *notify options are helpful for users, projects ,devs etc. however it can be misused in some cases and help attackers as well.",

Furthermore, users should always be wary of accepting any config changes provided to them by another source (even if they believe they understand them). If this is the real concern, perhaps including a general warning in the documentation is warranted.\r\n\r\nHowever, I disagree with providing a specific warning for a subset of options (i.e the -*notify commands) as it implies that the -*notify commands are introducing an exploit or are somehow less safe than other command-line options. This is not true.\r\n\r\nI also disagree with this approach of warning against specific, hypothetical attacks for each option when the underlying message in each warning is \"don't change anything in bitcoin.conf if you don't fully understand the change and don't accept changes from other people.\"\r\n\r\nIn summary, I think the suggested changes are misleading and do nothing to help protect the end-user from the hypothetical attacks described.",

Let me know if you know other config option in Bitcoin Core that do the same thing.\r\n\r\n> I also disagree with this approach of warning against specific, hypothetical attacks for each option when the underlying message in each warning is \"don't change anything in bitcoin.conf if you don't fully understand the change and don't accept changes from other people.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not about `bitcoin.conf`. These options can be used from command line or with shortcuts in Windows.\r\n\r\nWhat other approach do you think should help in documenting this behavior? \r\n\r\n> In summary, I think the suggested changes are misleading and do nothing to help protect the end-user from the hypothetical attacks described.\r\n\r\nNo they are not misleading. They just describe what `*notify` config options do and what can they can be used for. If we can't document these things we should probably remove all these fancy *notify config options or change their implementation to make them secure.",

Bob cannot identify if something is malicious and runs few commands someone suggested to use with *notify config param to fix one of the issues. Bob thinks he is _doing the right thing_ but he is running a command which could end up in losing all his money.\r\n\r\n**How to avoid this?** _Don't examine each script._ Create some restrictions that blocks any suspicious commands, scripts, connections etc. Unfortunately we don't have any such feature in Bitcoin Core so users have to do it at system level.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n1. PowerShell has execution polices which can be used to restrict scripts: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2\r\n\r\n2.
