But it's not the goal of this pull request. This one is just to say \"please, please don't increment the proto version with each client release\", if that point comes through I don't care what happens to this pull request.\n",

      "body": "Ok, I think we aren't thinking about the same kind of extensibility. My goal basically is to have a minimal protocol that is standardized (let's say the current protocol), it is simple and easy to understand. The protocol version should indicate that if a client supports the protocol version it'll understand the messages that are going to be sent. Where up until now the protocol version was being incremented every time a new version of the client was released, and you'd have to reverse engineer all changes (if any) from the main client. Extensibility doesn't really come into play at this point (not as I think of it anyway). Extensibility is another dimension where, while maintaining the basic protocol as is to avoid forcing others to upgrade, additional functionality can be built on top.\n\nI just want to make sure that alternative clients don't have to release a dummy update each time the main client updates just to say \"yeah, well nothing changed in the protocol, we still support it\".\n\nChanges to the protocol need to be explicit, rare and publicly announced. Most changes can be implemented by adding simple extensions, without breaking compatibility with alternative clients.\n",

I assume you meant software versioning flags and not the services flags. That will only hold for so long, I mean, you will end up with 0.3.12.32.1z and no-one will be happy. Can't we just call this the X version of the protocol and when the protocol actually changes, up the number by one and document the changes in the wiki?\n\nIf you did mean the services flags those should be carefully considered before introducing, once introduced they will stay forever. They are not at all made for marking \"new\" or \"different\" clients but network capabilities.\n\nAlso, the use of (or lack of) the subversioning field is also irritating, why not simply have the name + version of the client? The packet will get a bit bigger yes, but that doesn't seem to bother anybody with all the 64-bit values. It's very handy to see what software versions are currently running in the network.\n\nPlease, reconsider to merge this a step towards client diversity - please do not treat the protocol as the same thing as the client or we will never have a stable protocol nor developers that want to keep up with an every so changing protocol number.\n",

As someone starting another Bitcoin client it concerns me greatly that the core Bitcoin client is trying to monopolise what should be decentralised currency. How are we supposed to differentiate between protocol version and client? A client shouldn't be the protocol and forcing it to be the same thing is a silly coupling.\n\nblueCommand also makes a good point for the health of the network. Knowing the client composition is important.\n",
