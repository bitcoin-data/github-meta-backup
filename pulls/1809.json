      "body": "NIT: you'd save a byte by using OP_2DROP instead of DROP DROP\n\nI'm torn on whether or not it is time to implement a standard OP_DROP transaction type. If we do, it feels to me like it should be:\n\n```\n..64-or-fewer bytes.. OP_DROP ..n.. ..pubkeys.. ..m.. OP_CHECKMULTISIG\n```\n\n64 bytes because 64-byte SHA3 hashes are likely to be common in the next ten years.  CHECKMULTISIG instead of CHECKSIG because that gives the most flexibility. And pubkeys instead of a pubkeyhash because I suspect wrapping these in a P2SH transaction will be useful.\n\nYou should be able to do whatever you need with one max-64-byte push instead of two max-32-byte pushes.  E.g. for distributed bonds the transaction might be\n\n```\n PUSH(\"ISSUE<32-byte-hash>\") DROP 1 <pukey> 1 CHECKMULTISIG\n```\n\nServices interested in bond transactions would look for ISSUE+exactly 32 bytes.\n\nRE: removing the incentive to adopt appropriate payment protocols: If there is no new bitcoin address type corresponding to this transaction type, then I don't think that is an issue.\n\nRE: limits: the intent has always been to move away from hard-coded limits and create a market for transactions based on size, priority and fees paid. Perhaps the right thing to do is allow these as standard transactions, but drop them if they don't meet the minimum fee threshold (disallow them as \"free\" transactions).\n",

      "body": "As I enumerated on Jeff's call out for mob support ( :P ) ,  the actually likely applications of this are instant messaging, txn source deanonymization, and timestamping. The first two should be correctly addressed by a payment protocol (optionally via a p2p network), the latter should be accomplished via coinbase timestamping.   There would be no reason to develop either of those functions with this transaction type made standard, except preserving Bitcoin's long term viability.  I don't see how a new address type comes into play there.\n\nDisallowing them as free transactions is elegant. I do like that.  I don't like that this incentivizes script pubkey bloat over scriptsig bloat, mostly because our priority calculation is currently inadequate (treats scriptpubkey and scriptsig size the same).\n",

I also feel quite strongly that the ability to attach a tiny bit of data to your own transaction should be a fundamental right of every bitcoin user, even unrelated to the distributed bond proposals.  The use case crops up again and again, and people are doing to do it anyway, whether we like it or not.  See Hal's description of a standard transaction that _right now_ may be [ab]used for data storage, for example.\n",

My opinion remains that only data necessary for the world to validate the transfer belongs in the transaction - anything else is private information between sender and receiver.\n",

      "body": "Dropped data can be left out of the working set as it can't affect spendability, I think? That means the only cost is disk storage, not disk seeks or memory, and rarely accessed disk storage is cheap. You can buy a terabyte hard disk for almost nothing these days.\n\nThis does remind me a lot of the DNS discussions. We definitely don't want totally random data-intensive applications to stuff data into the chain, for legal reasons if nothing else. On the other hand, financial applications that need to strongly associate data with a particular financial transaction don't seem unreasonable. Satoshi said once that he spent a long time trying to find a way to allow messages in transactions:\n\n\"I badly wanted to find some way to include a comment with indirect transfers, but there just wasn't a way to do it.  Bitcoin uses EC-DSA, which was essential for making the block chain compact enough to be practical with today's technology because its signatures are an order of magnitude smaller than RSA.  But EC-DSA can't encrypt messages like RSA, it can only be used to verify signatures.\"\n\nSometimes it makes me wonder ... if he'd known how to do encryption using the same keys, would v0.1 of Bitcoin have allowed size-limited text messages?\n\nI think the restrictions Gavin proposes would mean any IM system (etc) would be uncompetitive with a well implemented payment protocol.\n\nIt's possible to be too extreme about shrinking the chain. For instance, it's technically possible to do threshold signatures without CHECKMULTISIG by using secret sharing (see Ibrahim, Ali and EI-Sawy). So maybe CHECKMULTISIG should be made non-standard to encourage somebody to implement that. Or ... maybe we should just accept the efficiency hit and get threshold signatures deployed earlier. In practice we chose the latter. You could make the same arguments for addresses (they mean long term storage of a hash, key and sig instead of just a key and sig).\n\nLet's see what Jeff comes up with. If he builds a really compelling bond market app on testnet and people want to use it, it'll be easier to judge the costs and benefits.\n",

That just feels wrong. \n\nWould it be possible to have an expiration date on the information? So that the OP_DROP could truly be dropped after some time? I guess not, if they're hashed into the transaction...\n",
