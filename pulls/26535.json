    "body": "Fixes #2039\r\n\r\nThis PR allows node operators to set file permissions on finalized blk files to be read-only.\r\n\r\nGenerally, we assume that the node can write to anything within the data directory. But, in this case, the finalized blk files don't need to be written to again. So, it might be useful to be able to set them as read-only.\r\n\r\nThis only makes sense with **finalized** block files as blk files that have logical space under the 128 MiB limit need to be writable for appending additional blocks.\r\n\r\nUsing read-only permissions had caused a problem while using `-reindex` because there was an unnecessary flush being performed on unmodified blk files within `BlockManager::FlushBlockFile`.\r\n\r\nThe flush would show up in logs in two ways:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-11-19T14:26:57Z [loadblk] Loaded 119965 blocks from external file in 3868921ms\r\n2022-11-19T14:26:57Z [loadblk] Reindexing block file blk00001.dat...\r\n2022-11-19T14:26:57Z [loadblk] Unable to open file /tmp/btc/blocks/blk00000.dat\r\n2022-11-19T14:26:57Z [loadblk] ERROR: Flush: failed to open file 0\r\n2022-11-19T14:26:57Z [loadblk] *** Flushing block file to disk failed. This is likely the result of an I/O error.\r\n2022-11-19T14:26:57Z [loadblk] Error: A fatal internal error occurred, see debug.log for details\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-11-19T13:17:59Z [loadblk] [bench] FlushStateToDisk: write block and undo data to disk started\r\n2022-11-19T13:17:59Z [loadblk] Unable to open file /tmp/btc/blocks/blk00000.dat\r\n2022-11-19T13:17:59Z [loadblk] ERROR: Flush: failed to open file 0\r\n2022-11-19T13:17:59Z [loadblk] *** Flushing block file to disk failed. This is likely the result of an I/O error.\r\n2022-11-19T13:17:59Z [loadblk] Error: A fatal internal error occurred, see debug.log for details\r\n2022-11-19T13:18:14Z [loadblk] [bench] FlushStateToDisk: write block and undo data to disk completed (15582.56ms)\r\n2022-11-19T13:18:14Z [loadblk] [bench] FlushStateToDisk: write block index to disk started\r\n2022-11-19T13:18:14Z [loadblk] [leveldb] WriteBatch memory usage: db=index, before=0.0MiB, after=0.0MiB\r\n2022-11-19T13:18:14Z [loadblk] [bench] FlushStateToDisk: write block index to disk completed (4.38ms)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo test these changes, you can grab some linearized test blk files over at https://github.com/mruddy/test_blk_files\r\nYou only need to import a handful of the files to test that the flush doesn't cause the problem anymore.\r\n\r\nOnce you have the files, setup with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p /tmp/btc && ./src/qt/bitcoin-qt -debug -logthreadnames -datadir=/tmp/btc -loadblock=/readonly/btc/main/blk{00000..00005}.dat -connect=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen those are done importing, stop the node and run\r\n\r\n```\r\nchmod 0400 /tmp/btc/blocks/blk00000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, start the node again, and this time run the reindex and verify that the failure does not occur as will occur without this PR's patch.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./src/qt/bitcoin-qt -debug -logthreadnames -datadir=/tmp/btc -reindex -connect=0\r\n```",

I did it this way to achieve the effect with the smallest difference in runtime function. `BlockManager::FlushBlockFile` can flush the undo file later in that method. For example, if you start out with some read-only blk files and have removed the corresponding rev*.dat files, the difference is that the way I did it will still create the rev files when the flush is called. If you don't call the flush, then the rev files won't be created then. This might be a meaningless difference. I'll look deeper into the undo file handling. If we avoid the flush entirely, maybe we could make the corresponding undo files read-only (but I tend to think that's less useful and possibly not all that desirable).",
