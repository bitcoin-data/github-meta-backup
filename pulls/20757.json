      "body": "Couple of things that I wanted to discuss and I don't think there will be a better place because its related to Bitcoin Core and Tor:\r\n\r\n1. Dandelion++ was not implemented in Bitcoin Core. Details here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20203 So Tor is very important for Bitcoin Core users. How do we make it easier for everyone to use and get more users running onion service when using Bitcoin Core? Maybe make the documentation user friendly? Can we add few screenshots? Can we add using Bitcoin Core on Android using ABCore or Nayuta as mentioned in the last part here: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98913/how-to-run-bitcoin-core-as-onion-service-on-windows-ubuntu-and-android\r\n\r\n2. Tor recently had a [consensus bug](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237) and I think it has lot of issues which are regularly exploited on different levels with some of them mentioned here: http://hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/906-Tor-0day-The-Management-Vulnerability.html How do we improve privacy in Bitcoin Core without being dependent on Tor which has its own issues to deal with? Can we contact the author of this above mentioned blog and request to patch Tor for a good use (Bitcoin Core) and we maintain a fork of Tor? Are there enough developers interested to work on something like this which will involve lot of code, review, tests etc. ? \r\n\r\nI tried asking on Twitter but there was no response: https://twitter.com/prayankgahlot/status/1305919047398162434",

Of course sometimes no one responds on IRC, StackExchange or anywhere else. We all have to deal with this if we ask lots of questions. One of the downsides of open source. There is no boss or manager who is paid to answer all of your questions. Keep asking them though, it is a good way to learn.

Core is not going to maintain a fork of Tor. That would be horrendous scope creep. We all have a motivation to improve documentation (Tor or otherwise). Feel free to open specific PRs to improve documentation. Some changes may not get review interest and some changes won't get merged.

Automatically create a Bitcoin Core onion service\n \n-Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket\n-API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' onion services programmatically.\n-Bitcoin Core has been updated to make use of this.\n-\n-This means that if Tor is running (and proper authentication has been configured),\n-Bitcoin Core automatically creates an onion service to listen on. This will positively\n-affect the number of available .onion nodes.\n-\n-This new feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening (`-listen`), and\n-requires a Tor connection to work. It can be explicitly disabled with `-listenonion=0`\n-and, if not disabled, configured using the `-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` settings.\n-To show verbose debugging information, pass `-debug=tor`.\n-\n-Connecting to Tor's control socket API requires one of two authentication methods to be\n-configured.
