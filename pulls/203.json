Note I made a conscious decision here that I only bother to keep the actual password entered by the user out of memory/swap as much as possible, not the derived key or the private keys themselves.  I have a separate branch which encrypts private keys in memory (much easier than not loading until needed in the current architecture) but still keeps the key to decrypt them in memory.  Hopefully someone has the time to patch bitcoin to be a bit more careful about when it generates private keys and make it possible for password entry only at decrypt-time.\n",
