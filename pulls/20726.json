Is that worth pointing out (e.g. \"Peers MAY decide to not serve peers that announce this flag\").\r\n\r\nShould interaction with tx-relay specific other messages like mempool, filterload, filteradd, filterclear, feefilter be specified (e.g. these messages are disabled/forbidden/ignored on block only connections)?\r\n\r\nMaybe it's worth pointing out that blocktxn/getblocktxn still function?",

      "body": "@sipa Thanks for taking a look!\r\n\r\n> If I understand it correctly, the BIP idea doesn't concern itself with this being outbound->inbound or not, but the implementation only ever announces it in the outbound direction, and will disconnect if it's received from a (full) outbound peer. Is that worth pointing out (e.g. \"Peers MAY decide to not serve peers that announce this flag\").\r\n\r\nYes good observation.  When I was working on this, I realized that there was no protocol need to restrict this as being a message from inbound->outbound peer, so while I didn't have an immediate use case for outbound peers sending this message to inbound ones, I also thought there seemed to be little downside to permitting it in the future.\r\n\r\nThe only case where I thought it could be problematic is if we connect out to a peer that we expect to be a full-relay peer, and it turns out the peer tells us we won't get any transactions from them -- in this case I think we ought to disconnect.  (Arguably it's a bug that today we don't do this when we get fRelay=false from such a peer in their version message.)\r\n\r\nI'll update the BIP to reflect that peers should feel free to use this information in deciding who to stay connected to.\r\n\r\n> Should interaction with tx-relay specific other messages like mempool, filterload, filteradd, filterclear, feefilter be specified (e.g. these messages are disabled/forbidden/ignored on block only connections)?\r\n\r\nYes, I should both specify that those messages are not permitted, and I think disconnect peers who send them to us after negotiating BLOCKRELAY. I think this will require an extra piece of state for outbound peers who might send us a BLOCKRELAY message, but that seems no big deal.\r\n \r\n> Maybe it's worth pointing out that blocktxn/getblocktxn still function?\r\n\r\nI'll update the BIP to explicitly reflect this as well.\r\n",

This would work today with clients that connect to us and that are addr relay black holes.\r\n\r\n> ... increases the maintenance burden on the project with additional code complexity.\r\n\r\nI've implemented my suggestion here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...jnewbery:2020-12-implicit-addr-relay?expand=1. It's a 20 line change, and doesn't seem too complex.\r\n\r\n> I don't think this would achieve a nice way to eliminate the m_tx_relay pointer that we keep per-peer, because the existing protocol doesn't have a good way to communicate that transaction relay will never be enabled on the link.\r\n\r\nI didn't implement this on my branch, but it'd be easy to do. Just defer initializing the m_tx_relay pointer until the peer has implicitly opted in to tx relay (but that seems to be a different issue from what you're trying to accomplish in this PR).\r\n\r\nOne problem with a new `blockrelay` message is that it's peculiarly specific to the Bitcoin Core implementation at this point in time. It's the first feature negotiation message that opts _out_ of certain features (`tx`, `inv`, `getdata(tx)`) but remains silent on other features or potential future features (are cfilters supported on inbound-block-relay peers? What about Erlay/`sendrecon`/etc?)",

It's a 20 line change, and doesn't seem too complex.\r\n\r\nThe downside to an approach like this (for both `m_addr_known` and `m_tx_relay`) is that we don't get the benefit of limiting and bounding the resources that will be used on the peer at the time of connection.  Adding a p2p message that is sent at the start of a connection (such as the one proposed here) allows us to do that.  Once we have a way to bound the resources of a peer that is connecting to us with this intent, I plan to propose that we increase the number of inbound connection slots that we can service, and reserve some of those for BLOCKRELAY peers.  From there, I think we could then start to increase the number of outbound block-relay-only connections we make without concern that we are taking over too many inbound connection slots on the network or using up too many node resources.\r\n\r\nFor some additional context, please see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-480400958 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19858#issuecomment-688918364.  Note also the ambiguity of our current approach to guessing that a peer is an inbound-block-relay-only peer, such as was done in #19670.",

      "body": "strong concept ACK - having connections explicitly declare expectations around what-to-relay makes a lot of sense. both for the current state as well as the future direction you've indicated.\r\n\r\nthat said, I have lots of thoughts to consider around approach :) \r\n\r\n**BIP:**\r\nmy main questions are around other use cases & long term plans. the current proposal involves sending a singular message that disables 2/3 inventory types, but what about other circumstances where a peer might not want to participate in addr or tx relay? \r\n\r\nas a current example, it would make sense for a node that has enabled `-connect` to not participate in addr relay for all the same reasons as this PR: it would blackhole any self-announcements and its unnecessary bandwidth & memory usage. \r\n\r\nbased on conversations that arose when you originally implemented block-relay-only connections, I could imagine a future where we implement connections that permit block & addr relay, but disable tx relay.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting we need to implement all of this right away, but I'd like to understand the high level direction so we can to leave the door open for future improvements, since this BIP will set a precedence. \r\n\r\none route that makes sense to me- a message format that enables peers to signal which inventory types they would like to subscribe to (or unsubscribe from). either as separate messages, or a single message with multiple fields. if we go an opt-in route, we could also defer initializing the relevant data structures (`m_tx_relay` & `m_addr_known`) until we receive the message indicating the peer wants to relay that type of message. \r\n\r\nI think this might be similar to ideas that john & aj have touched on in their reviews. \r\n\r\n**Implementation: Approach** \r\n- I think I agree with aj's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20726#discussion_r548346466 that `INBOUND_BLOCK_RELAY` might be better represented as the `INBOUND` connection type with the additional state maintaining if tx/addr relay is enabled. I believe it would reduce the diff, and in the places where we want to discern the two, the additional check of data structures is useful / relevant anyways.\r\n\r\nI was looking into the `m_tx_relay` and `m_addr_known` data structures, trying to come up with ideas for improving the code paths. (I introduced some of the current state, but its not great.) I also saw your proposal and the review conversation in #20676. I don't have any amazing solutions, but I have one or two thoughts to consider: \r\n- whatever route we go, would be nice if `m_tx_relay` and `m_addr_known` are handled similarly. right now they are a bit out of sync (eg. the check for instantiating in the constructor)\r\n- one option: `CNode` constructor checks connection types to decide whether or not to instantiate the object, and the `Relay[xxxx]WithConn()` function can check for presence of the object. I think that would mean the connection type -> data structure relationship is only defined once, the structures could be deallocated without problems, and we have code safety of not dereferencing null pointers without needing to blur the layers? \r\n- as I already mentioned, I like the idea around deferring the creation of these structures.\r\n\r\n**Implementation: Specifics**\r\n(sorry if its too early for some of these comments) \r\n- we'll definitely need to fix the remote crash bug :) \r\n- if we do keep `INBOUND_BLOCK_RELAY` as a separate connection type, might be worth adding to the check here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L2200 \r\n- the `IsBlockOnlyConn` function is now extra confusing. It should either be updated to return both types, or the name changed (probably the latter). \r\n\r\n**Questions** \r\n- #19670 introduced a workaround to deduce inbound block-relay-only peers and protect them from eviction. After this PR, do you think we could revisit to make it more direct? ",

Maybe the BIP should have a section explaining that block-relay is the primary traffic class and that a peer can only escalate from there (e.g to addr-relay by sending after a ADDRRELAY).\r\n\r\nBut this direction may have issues. E.g if a future p2p extension governing addr-relay is neutral for block-relay, how would you enable persistent addr-relay-only connections ? ",

It also avoids any confusion about how this mechanism interacts with possible future features.",

      "body": "Thanks all for the comments so far.  I've renamed the p2p message to \"disabletx\" to more clearly communicate what the effect of processing this message is.  Current draft is here: https://github.com/sdaftuar/bips/blob/2020-09-negotiate-block-relay/bip-disable-tx.mediawiki\r\n\r\nSome highlights, besides the message being renamed:\r\n * I've made it more explicit that the BIP37-related messages are disallowed\r\n * I've clarified that addr messages should be avoided for now, but could be sent/received if in the future we deploy a way to negotiate addr relay explicitly.  This accommodates existing software behavior without preventing us from cleanly separating these two ideas in the future.\r\n\r\nI don't think it makes sense to add a \"sendblocks\" p2p message, because there is no use case I'm aware of for connections on the p2p network to not want blocks (really, headers or block hashes, because unrequested blocks are themselves not widely supported on the network).  If there were such a use case, someone should feel free to propose this.  For now, I think it's sufficient for this use case -- of negotiating block-relay-only connections -- to disable transaction relay, and listening nodes can use the disabling of transaction relay as proposed here as a proxy for \"block-relay-only\" connections, to facilitate increased connection limits in the future.\r\n\r\nI do think that adding a way to opt-in to addr relay is desirable, however I think more research is required to figure out what that should look like.  Naively, I'd think it makes sense to opt-in to addr-relay on a per-network-type basis (as described in BIP 155), but how exactly that should work is intertwined with what relay strategies might make sense, and I would not feel comfortable proposing anything at this time (for instance, I'd say that we should clarify what the goals of address relay are, analyze what kinds of relay strategies optimize for that goal along with any DoS tradeoffs that might be introduced, and then determine what our own implementation might look like, before we finalize a specification).  If someone wants to work on such a proposal, I would encourage it.  However the current BIP was drafted with the goal of being compatible with any future work in this area so I don't think this should be a blocker.\r\n\r\nI'll wait a bit for more comments here, but my plan is to share this with the bitcoin-dev list soon and then return to the implementation questions that have come up so far.",

      "body": "@amitiuttarwar Hopefully I addressed most of your comments/questions on the BIP and future direction I have in mind.  Just wanted to answer this:\r\n \r\n> * #19670 introduced a workaround to deduce inbound block-relay-only peers and protect them from eviction. After this PR, do you think we could revisit to make it more direct?\r\n\r\nI think we would wait until this has been deployed for a while and then (potentially) change the eviction logic.  Two things occur to me on this point:\r\n- Older software will continue to use the old way of (not) communicating their intentions, via the fRelayTxes flag. So to accommodate older software we may not want to switch to keying off this p2p message for a little while at least.\r\n- It seems most of the feedback has been to shy away from encoding overly broad semantics into a single p2p message; while I think that is fine it also means that from our peer's point of view, they will have to infer the connection \"type\" from the properties of the peer, rather than from the peer declaring its full intentions in a single message.  I think for now we can treat \"will never relay txes\" as essentially synonymous with these block-relay connections, but perhaps in the future there will be some distinction, and all a peer can do is rely on some set of flags that it might use to preference some peers over others -- which might put us exactly back to where we are today, with us just keying off of whether fRelayTxes is false, anyway.\r\n",

      "body": "> > a block-relay-only connection today, our peer doesn't know that we don't want addr relay on the link\r\n> \r\n> These seem like they're conceptually different topics, and treating them as the same seems like an implementation-specific thing...\r\n> \r\n\r\n> I agree with some of the other comments here that it seems too implementation-specific to encode \"relay blocks, don't relay txs, don't relay addrs\" in a single P2P message.\r\n\r\n@jnewbery @luke-jr I'm a bit confused about both of your critiques of this as too \"implementation-specific\".  The goal of the this BIP process is to standardize/formalize these block-relay-only connections in a useful way -- in my view, this behavior has been a good thing to introduce and we want to make more of these connections and so it is worth standardizing.  \r\n\r\nSo I think the question is what is the best way to include this in the protocol.  I think there are some good reasons to make this narrowly tailored to the exact thing we need -- disabling of transaction relay -- but we should be mindful that comes with some cost to how these connections can be understood by the recipient (now and going forward as the p2p protocol evolves), and therefore code complexity in the implementation.  At any rate, I think I'm happy with the latest draft that spells out clearly that transaction relay must be disabled, and address relay is discouraged in the absence of any explicit negotiation for it (leaving the door open for a future addr relay protocol to govern addr behavior).\r\n\r\n> What is the purpose of compactblocks without transaction-relay traffic?\r\n\r\n@luke-jr You asked this question back when block-relay-only connections were introduced (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-484634796), and I answered this question back then as well (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-484666402).  Nodes using these connections are welcome to also have full-relay connections to other peers, and therefore we might expect compact block relay to work just fine over block-relay-only links.  I would recommend looking at the logs of your own node(s) to see how well compact block relay works on the existing block-relay-only peers that we have; in my experience it works quite well with some block-relay-only peers being selected as HB peers (and vice versa).\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the BIP, software would be free to implement this proposal and not BIP 152, and just rely on `getdata` messages to request blocks.  Acceptance of this proposed BIP does not require acceptance/implementation of BIP 152.\r\n\r\n> > In the future, we can also save a bit of memory by not allocating (or deallocating) the peer data structures we maintain for transaction and address relay.\r\n> Can't we do that today, just by not allocating it until we know the peer wants it?\r\n\r\nAs I mention above, the goal is to be able to bound a peer's resource utilization at the time the connection is completed.  It would be unfortunate if a peer enabled tx relay later in a connection's lifetime and suddenly got disconnected just because we attempted to move it from one accounting bucket to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Even if the bip stays as is, we might want to disallow `tx` messages as well, or is there some downside I am missing?\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke The intent is to disallow sending a tx on such a link -- already it's the case that if we receive a transaction from a block-relay-only outbound peer that we'll disconnect them.  Once we no longer instantiate the `m_tx_relay` structure for inbound peers sending us `disabletx`, the existing code would already disconnect such a peer that sends an unrequested tx as well; but I will go ahead and implement that behavior in this PR as well because that is indeed an oversight. Thanks for noticing this!",

      "body": "> If so, I agree that if we're connected to an upgraded peer, we should send fRelay=false as an alternative mechanism to disable transaction relay messages on the connection. However, if we want to deprecate fRelay in the future once BIP338 is deployed, I think we should not treat fRelay as a required part of the spec.\r\n\r\n@ariard Deprecating `fRelay` doesn't seem very likely to me as something we will try to do, just because it seems like it potentially breaks any software that may have implemented BIP 60 for basically no benefit.  Maybe no such software exists, but it just doesn't seem worth the effort to try to determine whether that is true, particularly if getting it wrong would be hard to know and would have unfortunate consequences on the network graph (while getting it right has no real benefit).\r\n\r\nSo while I could change the BIP to be more agnostic, and just require `fRelay=false` if `fRelay` is sent at all, that seems less useful than just requiring `fRelay` to be sent instead.  Note that no other parts of BIP 37 are required, so effectively this BIP would be just building off of BIP 60 -- which I think is the safest assumption about what will be compatible with other software on the network.",

Maybe no such software exists, but it just doesn't seem worth the effort to try to determine whether that is true, particularly if getting it wrong would be hard to know and would have unfortunate consequences on the network graph (while getting it right has no real benefit).\r\n\r\nWhile I think there is a minimal benefit to prune out old p2p logic, at least to decrease future maintenance costs, I agree that we don't have a formalized p2p features deprecation process, minimizing disruption risks for external softwares silently relying on the `fRelay` behavior.",

The main description of the PR could probably use some updates -- this isn't a draft, it could link to the bips repo now, and it's already got plenty of concept acks? \r\n\r\nComments on other comments: I think it would only make sense to deprecate `fRelay` as part of switching to a new \"p2p v2\" protocol.\r\n\r\nRest is I guess more about the bip/spec than the code per se.\r\n\r\nThe bip currently specifies \"A node that has sent or received a disabletx message to/from a peer MUST NOT send any of these messages to the peer:\"\r\n\r\nI think it would be better for that to be asymmetric, that is to say:\r\n\r\n* a node that has _**received**_ a disabletx message from a peer (`m_disable_tx == true`) MUST NOT _**send**_ INV/NOTFOUND messages for tx data, or TX messages to a peer; and\r\n* a node that has _**sent**_ a disabletx message to a peer (`IsBlockOnlyConn()`) MUST NOT _**send**_ GETDATA for tx/merkleblock data, FILTERADD/FILTERLOAD/FILTERCLEAR or MEMPOOL messages.\r\n\r\nIn that case, if an inbound blocks only node sends you a disabletx message, you can avoid allocating the TxRelay structure for that node saving memory, and also save bandwidth by avoiding sending INVs etc to that node; but if that inbound node is running in `-blocksonly=1` mode, it can still send the occasional tx to you which you can relay on to the rest of the network.\r\n\r\nLetting `-blocksonly=1` nodes free up resources seems worth the slight extra complexity to me, but ymmv I guess.\r\n\r\nNOTFOUND behaviour isn't mentioned in the bip.\r\n\r\nI guess \"It is RECOMMENDED [you don't send addr/getaddr/addrv2 if you sent/received disabletx]\" is stronger than I'd choose; and I don't think it's exactly what we implement, but overall agree with [sdaftuar's comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20726#issuecomment-1006005523).",

If you're really running in `-blocksonly=1` mode, and in the future when I hope we account for disabletx peers separately, then I think it's better to use up a full connection slot for your peer to reflect the higher expected bandwidth.\r\n\r\nI also don't like the idea of adding ambiguity about whether transactions might relay over a `disabletx` connection.  We're not making `-blocksonly=1` peers any worse off with this change, and I don't see a need to try to special case those semantics in new behavior that is essentially unrelated -- the goal is to make an allowance for lightweight block-relay-only peers, where we know the behavior is that only blocks and headers should propagate.\r\n\r\nThe updated BIP draft is here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1287\r\n\r\nI've fixed the typo in the commit message you mentioned, added additional logging, and also changed the bips.md update to reference 24.0 (and not 23.0) as the first release to include this code (hoping that's a good assumption!).",

I do think that bandwidth is perhaps the least important network resource to worry about (memory seems very important, as does CPU).  I think the goal is to make it so that in non-adversarial situations, the additional resources used by adding additional DISABLETX connection slots is something that node operators wouldn't really notice -- so that there's no issue with adding additional block-relay-only connections to the network graph.\r\n\r\nI think `-blocksonly=1` peers are somewhere in between; they should allow for less memory but also more bandwidth if they are sometimes relaying full blocks and addrs.  Maybe that's fine as long as the CPU usage is still low?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I assume `-blocksonly=1` is a relatively uncommon mode, so I'm not sure how important this is to optimize for.  If we changed the semantics to not relay transactions at all (or offered a mode where that was the case) then it's probably fine to start using DISABLETX on all the connections for such a peer.  With the current behavior, I also think it's fine for `-blocksonly=1` peers to have their regular connections be treated the same as (say) a node with an infinite minrelayfee/feefilter setting.  \r\n\r\n> Should DISABLETX also forbid BLOCK/GETDATA(block) messages in that case?\r\n\r\nI do think it's important not to ban GETDATA(block) traffic on block-relay-only links, because the whole point is to serve as an emergency fallback to keep the network in sync if there's some kind of attack happening.  The way I think about this is that we want the normal, non-adversarial case to be very low total network overhead for having these connections (memory, bandwidth, cpu, etc) but in the adversarial case, it's fine if node resource usage might go up a bit because then we're also getting an important benefit (and you'd figure that having defenses against such attacks makes it unappealing to try).",

      "body": "> At any rate, I assume `-blocksonly=1` is a relatively uncommon mode,\r\n\r\nYeah, I think that might be the key point. Probably `-blocksonly=1` isn't that attractive in general: if you want to be quick to get blocks, you want to get txs and do compact blocks; if you want to not use much resources, you probably want headers only, or to tunnel info directly rather than be on the open p2p network; if you want to just minimise requirements for a full p2p node, you probably just want a smaller but non-zero mempool... Provided `-blocksonly=1` nodes are only a very small proportion of the network, it doesn't seem super worthwhile optimising for the resources they use on other nodes. And if we did want to optimise for them, we could have them only have a couple of connections for relaying their own txs, and have all the rest of them be no-txs-ever connections which would let them use DISABLETX.\r\n\r\n",

That is the case for the local node selecting the peer as an outbound block-relay-only.  The `Peer`'s `m_tx_relay` is set to false in `InitializeNode` and no `TxRelay` object is instantiated. However, on the other side of the connection, the local node is seen as is `IsInboundConn()` and a `TxRelay` object allocated, allowing the send of `FEEFILTER` in `MaybeSendFeefilter`. So an outbound block-relay-only might send `FEEFILTER` messages provoking a disconnection with current code ? Or are you referencing another behavor or am I missing an interference with `fRelay` ?",

In this PR, nodes will only send `disabletx` to outbound block-relay-only peers, and we do not instantiate `m_tx_relay` for those block-relay-only peers.\r\n-> This is sufficient for node A to not send `feefilter` messages to node B, and hence node A should never be disconnected from node B due to the requirement that nodes sending `disabletx` not send `feefilter` messages.\r\n",

Then a block_relay_only connection comes in, and says \"oh, high version number, I'll send the DISABLETX msg\", which you then ignore. You don't send txs to them because they specified `fRelay=false`, but you do send a FEEFILTER message to them, and they then disconnect you.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be better to treat feature support and enablement separately; ie send \"disabletx false\" normally, and \"disabletx true\" for block-relay-only outbounds, with the logic being \"if both side support disabletx, and either side enables it, then don't send tx related messages and disconnect if they're received; otherwise no-op\" ?",

What I meant to describe was that we only disconnect an outbound peer who sends us the BLOCKRELAY message if we expect them to be a tx-relay or addr-relay peer.  If we are connecting to them as a MANUAL connection, then we'll stay connected and just not relay transactions on that link.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing the comment, I could improve the code to ensure we don't advertise addrs to such peers either -- I think that will be easy to do at the same time that I ensure that a BLOCKRELAY peer doesn't send us other disallowed messages (mempool, filterload/add/clear, etc).",

It might make more sense to have the connection type stay as \"inbound\" but have an extra flag for \"want blocks-only behaviour\" -- that flag could just be `m_tx_relay == nullptr` at which point you don't need to have locking to keep `m_tx_relay` and `m_conn_type` in sync. You still need something to ensure you don't free `m_tx_relay` while someone else might be using it, but that could be just changing it to a `shared_ptr`?\r\n\r\nActually, perhaps `m_tx_relay` simply shouldn't be allocated until you've received their VERACK, rather than contemplating deallocating it?",

Other negotiated features that do not seem to change the connection type include `WTXIDRELAY`,`SENDADDRV2`, `SENDCMPCT`, etc.\r\n\r\nAs a starting point, I'd suggest that connection types imply (1) a different level of trust in the peer (eg. `INBOUND` vs `OUTBOUND`) or (2) connection limits(eg. 2 for `OUTBOUND_BLOCK_RELAY`, 1 for `FEELER`) and all other features are attributes of a connection.  This also opens up future possibilities for peers that want other combinations like block and addr relay, but no tx relay, etc.",

If we have a set of semantics that we understand go together for a given peer, it's nice for code readability to encode that as simply as possible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my intention with the BIP was to allow future flexibility for what semantics might be possible (eg my intention is to allow for addr-relay to happen in the future if we add an explicit way to negotiate addr relay, as an example), so from that perspective, having a connection type perhaps implies too much of an understanding of what the peer may be doing.  And for inbound peers in particular, we never really know what they're doing, so perhaps having more than just \"inbound\" as a connection type may be misleading to future code readers as well.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of moving initialization of `m_tx_relay` to VERACK, but not sure if I'll end up tackling that here or deferring for the current refactoring work in progress to make more headway (I think we need to add a lock that guards access to the `m_tx_relay` pointer itself?)",

Given the limits overlap a little (extra outbounds vs feelers), and what to do when you have extra peers requires looking at other data anyway, I'm not sure that's very convincing though.\r\n\r\nHmm, how much we \"trust\" a connection might change over the course of a connection in future if we allow random inbound peers to authenticate themselves to us... So I guess that leaves me thinking that we should have `const m_conn_type` representing our purpose in having the connection? (Different purposes meaning substantial changes in the protocol state machine -- eg, blocks only we deliberately opt out of tx and addr relay even if we otherwise support both, feelers we disconnect after verack, addrfetch we disconnect after getting addresses, inbounds we have different delays for and send VERSION later)\r\n\r\n> (I think we need to add a lock that guards access to the m_tx_relay pointer itself?)\r\n\r\nMaybe?

Here, net_processing is constructing a callback (`sortfunc`) which it hands to net via `ForEachNodeThen()`. In that callback, net calls into a net_processing function (`IsAddRelayPeer()`), which in turn calls into a function in the net layer (`RelayAddrsWithConn()`). This net_processing -> net -> net_processing -> net layering makes it very difficult to construct a mental model of which component is responsible for what functions, and makes future work to rationalize the interface much more difficult.",

The language currently says \r\n\r\n> If a node sets the transaction relay field in the version message to a peer to false, then the disabletx message MAY also be sent in response to a version message from that peer if the peer's protocol version is >= 70017. If sent, the disabletx message MUST be sent prior to sending a verack.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy intention was that if you didn't specify fRelay, or if you set it to true, then you MUST NOT send a disabletx message.\r\n\r\nYes my thinking was that if node software implements BIP 37, then I didn't want this to conflict with BIP37-related logic, so I tried for compatibility.  At the same time, it seemed to me that fRelay may be required by some implementations (BIP60 tried to make it so, though I don't know what other software has implemented) so I figured the simplest thing was just to require software implementing this BIP to also be sending fRelay, and therefore the value being sent should be false.\r\n\r\nIt would also be possible to completely disentangle this from BIP 37 and either ignore the fRelay field or only require it to be false if it's sent at all, but I don't know how much difference that makes.  I think the way I've done it is clear and consistent (well once I fix the language in the BIP to remove the ambiguity you point out!) but other ways would be fine too.",

If we're connected to an upgraded peer, we can ignore setting `fRelay` in our version message and just send a DISABLETX.\r\n\r\nI don't think we have specific considerations to avoid disruption BIP37-related logic, in the sense of upgrading the connection type to full-relay if they signal `fRelay=false`. Doing so would break the purpose of our block-relay-only strategy. Actually, that's what we already do, at VERSION message reception, we ignore `fRelay` if peer doesn't have a `m_tx_relay` struct.\r\n\r\nNetwork-wise,, it'll be safe to deprecate BIP37-related logic on our side (i.e don't bother sending `fRelay` even to non-upgraded peers) only once BIP338 is widely deployed. Otherwise, legacy peers will be automatically disconnected when they're picked up as block-relay-only, thus impoverishing their connection graph (only able to connect as full-relay inbound slots).\r\n\r\nNote, I think the BIP change should waiwe about the omission case, otherwise it make a requirement to implement BIP60 only for the sake of sending a `fRelay=false`, and thus create an interdependency\r\nbetween both standards ?",

However, if we want to deprecate `fRelay` in the future once BIP338 is deployed, I think we should not treat `fRelay` as a required part of the spec.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my understanding, the proposed BIP338 draft is ambiguous as it sounds to make a requirement of a `disabletx` receiving peer to support first BIP37 (\"(provided that BIP 37 or BIP 60 has been implemented\") though at the same time explicitly says those standards are independent (\"This proposal is compatible with, but independent of, BIP 37. \").\r\n\r\nI would favor to make the BIP37 deprecation option more explicit in BIP338 (i.e remove \"provided that BIP37...\") and that dual-support is an implementation choice, not a spec requirement.\r\n\r\nThat said, this comment is not a substantial blocker to me to advance this work forward.",

      "body": "The way I look at this issue is that we have two competing goals:\r\na) Have well-defined behavior on the p2p network, to limit the range of behavior and make interactions easier to reason about in the future. This tends towards being strict around deploying new specifications, both to simplify our software logic and so that when people write their own implementations, they might notice if they break something during testing.\r\n\r\nb) Avoid disconnecting peers unless it's important/we have a good reason, because otherwise, over time, the network graph will become more fragile and less partition-resistant: older software that is silently failing to stay connected to newer software will have fewer honest peers to connect to and become easier to sybil.  (As an aside: to the extent that we do sometimes disconnect peers for imperfect behavior, it can be less risky to the network if we differentiate between inbound and outbound peers, and be more tolerant of inbound peers -- this would allow slightly broken software to still find honest peers and not be partitioned off the network over time.)\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, I'm reluctant to add new disconnection semantics for behavior that is harmless; in this case, I think it is supposed to be harmless to not have implemented BIP 338, as this is meant to be a purely optional specification.  The question to me then becomes: since we already disconnect peers for some messages if we have sent `fRelay=0`, should we add to the set of disallowed messages to such peers based on how we understand our own software to behave?\r\n\r\nI think it's a good point that those messages (tx-getdata, tx-notfound) should never come through to us if we've sent a `disabletx`, because presuming that our software isn't itself broken, we would never announce or send transactions to the peer.  However, if there is some other software on the network that is slightly broken around transaction relay and occasionally sends us a tx-getdata or tx-notfound when not appropriate, is that a big deal?  I'm not sure...\r\n\r\nFirst, changing our behavior in this way wouldn't prevent malicious peers from wasting our bandwidth (as they can do that without triggering disconnection, even without using these messages).  So instead, it would be to catch/handle broken peers and prevent them from taking up a connection slot or wasting our bandwidth.\r\n\r\nIf there is broken software out there that we know has a bug like this which causes these `fRelay=0` connections to be high bandwidth when they shouldn't be, by sending these specific p2p messages that you're suggestion we disconnect for, then I think that would be sufficient reason to do exactly what you suggest.  However, I'm not sure that we're aware of any such software.  In the absence of knowing such broken software exists, I think two other options are reasonable: a) do nothing until we notice it, or b) write smarter logic that catches the thing that I think we actually care about for these connections, which is bandwidth waste (ie seeing high traffic of bogus messages as a percentage of total traffic), and manages our connections using that metric as a factor.\r\n\r\nSo I'd say right now I'm reluctant, but not strongly opposed, to adding more disconnection criteria like you're suggesting in this PR.  However if someone proposed adding more disconnection criteria as part of a bigger resource management strategy, I think that could be totally reasonable.\r\n",
