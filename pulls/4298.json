    "body": "Replaces transactions if a new transaction is seen with a higher fee, specifically both a higher fee per KB and a higher absolute fee. Children are evaluated for replacement as well, using a fixed depth/breadth limit to prevent DoS attacks. Child-pays-for-parent is however not yet supported.\n\nThis patch doesn't include any wallet changes to actually take advantage of replace-by-fee, e.g. fee bumping functionality. I have however written some Python utilities for experimentation: https://github.com/petertodd/replace-by-fee-tools Now that the wallet code handles double-spends correctly fee bumping and other replace-by-fee applications won't mess up your wallet with never-confirming transactions. That said Bitcoin-QT does need some UI improvements re: conflicts.\n\nNote that this is the version suitable for a pull-req; if you want to actually try out replace-by-fee functionality use https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/replace-by-fee-v0.9.1 instead. It has preferential peering code that seeks out other replace-by-fee supporting peers and connects to them, ensuring your replacements get propagated and you see others' replacements.\n\nAs discussed elsewhere ad nauseam, unconfirmed transactions are easily double-spent via a variety of methods with high success rates, even without miners implementing replace-by-fee. For instance the above replace-by-fee-tools has about a 95% success rate against most wallet software by taking advantage of the minimum v0.9 fee drop. Better to be honest to users about what security guarantees Bitcoin actually provides, and replace-by-fee functionality is highly useful otherwise to lower fees through more aggressive fee estimation, fix stuck transactions, lower fees by combining successive transactions, etc.\n",

But you or your colleagues working on the core need to harden the payment protocol before you ACK this. Making it 95% likely that anybody can double spend a zero conf transaction breaks real world usage of bitcoin.\n\nWith a 10-minute block time, zero conf transactions NEED to happen in order to allow real world purchases at everyday retailers. Either that or we start having centralised services where you pre-load an account before you can order a happy meal at McDonalds, have people implement credit-card-level fees to compensate for the few who will abuse the system, or make people wait 10 minutes to buy their morning coffee before walking off. None of these alternatives are desirable.\n\nYour work is appreciated, but the inclusion of this patch before implementing further appropriate safety features is unfortunately wrong.\n",

      "body": "There are two opinions about what the responsibility of the network should be, here: zero-confirmation double-spending prevention or not.\n\nIn my opinion, zero-confirmation security is a useful feature, and one that a significant portion of the network came to rely on. Most of those are aware that it's only a best-effort mechanism, and that with cooperation from miners, it is easily bypassed. But people do rely on the fact that it at least isn't trivial to pull off, and that it will happen only in a small percentage of cases. This property is still valuable; something similar happens for credit-card fraud (where it's sometimes the merchant taking the risk, sometimes the bank, but they still feel that even if risky, the payment system provided is valuable).\n\nMechanisms exist to improve detection of potential double-spends, but due to technical reasons, I believe it is not possible to reliably build this into the core network responsabilities either (at least not without making it either a huge DoS attack vector, or making it trivially bypassable for someone who is already intentionally attacking).\n\nAnyhow, I don't see how this property of preventing 0-conf double spends can be maintained in the long term. It only requires a few miners to choose for the (short-term) rational behavior (choosing the most per-byte-valuable transactions, regardless of which was first) to to remove that protection entirely. In addition, every change in standardness, consensus rule upgrades, conditional or rate-limiting of relays, ... add additional and hard-to-predict risks.\n\nWhen that happens, I think it's much healthier for the ecosystem to acknowledge that double spending can and will happen. I don't think that means accepting a broken system. It just has different properties than what many expect today; for example, there is much less need for overshooting fees to be sure a transaction gets accepted.\n\nI don't think that means we must force the whole ecosystem to switch to that model immediately. Changing such assumptions is hard, and the disruption can hurt. I'm not sure today is the right time either, but eventually I think we better prepare for that.\n",

But surely, there can be some form of mitigation/risk management built in?\n- Maybe an option for vendors to enforce scorched-earth payments through some simple hard-coded mechanism to begin with - all a merchant wants to do is display a single QR code and get a '_beep_ - accepted' response. Anything else breaks the simplicity a customer expects when buying a sandwich, such as 'First set up a protective payment for me with this QR code'. Wait. 'No, you can trust I (the merchant) am not going to defraud you'. Wait. 'Now, pay me through this QR code'. Wait.\n- 'Dust sweeping transactions' whereby a single user can sign a large collection of dust-ONLY transactions all at once in order to sweep them into a single usable stack of coins. This would give no reason for dust to be included in retail transactions and therefore transactions containing dust inputs could be blocked entirely.\n\nI'm trying to think of others, which is why I'd also like to know the outcome of the conversations petertodd says he has been having with vendors - what has he recommended they do in order to reduce fraud? \n\nIf we just have to 'accept' a certain percentage of fraud, we will end up EXACTLY where the credit card companies are with their 3.5% fees to retailers.\n",

For instance Mike Hearn's coinbase reallocation/block blacklisting proposal can make zeroconf secure, but at the cost of adding real-world politics and regulation to whether or not a block is accepted by the network. Equally if defacto behavior is what's required prevent double-spending, then courts will very likely find failure to follow that behavior grounds for civil liability:\n\n> 21:22 < gmaxwell> In a civil claim, its almost sufficient to just show someone was harmed and that you were on the critical path.\n\n(the full IRC discussion where the above came from is worth reading: http://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizards/2013/11/13-11-20.log)\n\nBy using replace-by-fee policy you set an early precedent that the Bitcoin network and Bitcoin mining does not provide guarantees it can't provide in a decentralized environment. This is why I argued previously that if you care about decentralization, you should be mining with replace-by-fee: https://pay.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/235zv5/why_you_should_mine_with_replacebyfee_a/\n",

If they are not good at not double spending by accident, they must be good at double spending on purpose?\n\nAnd perhaps if you solved this issue first (in your own words) \"explicit support in the payment protocol for it to let wallet software know that they must be sure a double-spend isn't going to accidentally happen\", then introducing replace-by-fee right now wouldn't leave zero conf transactions quite so open to potential abuse.\n\nFurthermore, what mitigation methods have you discussed with vendors?\n\nCheers!\n",

That does not therefore imply that it is wise to make attacks even easier by relaxing the existing security properties further.\n\nReplace-by-fee was widely considered anti-social on various forums.

      "body": "@NanoAkron That's just an observation from my double-spending logs. Basically it appears that at least some clients are double-spending inputs on occasion, probably because the wallet software doesn't reliably record the fact that it's created a transaction spending the input. If you're to use replace-by-fee scorched-earth then your going to want wallet software that takes additional steps to be absolutely sure it won't double-spend accidentally.\n\nAs for solving the issue first, everything I'm seeing indicates that it's a minority of services that are actually depending on the existing and very weak zeroconf security, and that minority keeps getting smaller. e.g. at the Bitcoin conference I talked to two-way ATM vendors, and most had already implemented a receipt scheme so customers could go to the ATM, send their funds, get a receipt for it, and then upon confirmation, come back and get their money. Meanwhile Mycelium's local trader feature is showing that in the absence of clarity people are implementing stuff that is a lot more vulnerable then they realize; with replace-by-fee implemented I'm sure Mycelium would have done things right the first time and implemented secure multisig escrow and/or micropayment channels.\n\n@jgarzik There's nothing anti-social about wanting to see strongly secure solutions be implemented, and mining stay unregulated. As I've argued quite clearly, the more people expect zeroconf to work as-is, the greater the temptation is to use legal tools against miners who mine double-spends, either intentionally or by accident. Secondly it creates a market for guaranteeing confirmation, which is something only large miners can offer, not small ones, again creating an incentive to centralize mining.\n",

Pay first, get a receipt, walk back to their table, wait 10 or maybe 20 minutes, walk back to the bar and collect their drink? Have you thought about how people transact in the real world or is the philosophical/intellectual perfection of the software more important to you than real world use?\n\nAnd if micropayment channels are one of the solutions you're proposing, why not implement them in the core before devastating what little security there is in 0conf?\n\nAs @jgarzik said before: \"We are seeing bad behavior, might as well release a feature making bad behavior easier\" is illogical.\n",

We've also found out over and over again that people write remarkably broken and insecure code when they can't see why it's insecure - e.g. the services talking to me right now about how they're getting defrauded via doubles-spends.\n\nEqually, if you stick with the broken zeroconf security we have now, every time we (or anyone else) changes anything in Bitcoin Core we're allowing for doublespends - I've already seen Mike Hearn argue against making changes on that basis rather than sound technical reasons: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3715#issuecomment-44403095\n\n> If you insist on a patch like this (which just puts off the inevitable for a few minutes - hardly useful), please at least just make it block inclusion rather than relay policy. Otherwise it turns miners that use it into double spending tools for no benefit or reason, forcing everyone else to use an ever more convoluted risk analysis to decide whether an unconfirmed transaction might get double spent by a -datacarrier=0 user. This doesn't help anyone, not even the node running the flag, who must process and store the transaction when another miner confirms it anyway.\n\nEqually look at Luke-Jr's pool Eligius, which happily mines non-standard transactions no-one else does; I can always double-spend with %8 probability by simply submitting a conflicting tx to Eligius first. Or I could just double-spend you with some other high probability by submitting a tx with a dust output, which many miners still mine. (BTC Guild IIRC) This is only going to get worse too with fee estimation, as I can always just fine a pool with a lower minfee estimate than most of the network, relay to them first, and then relay the more reasonable fee tx to everyone else. Again, do we just not deploy fee estimation because it'll harm zeroconf security? Remember that relaying double-spends around the network is a DoS attack.\n\nAlso, here's an interesting experiment: Earn 1% more by mining with replace-by-fee - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=645120.0 At some price miners will upgrade.\n",

That's a much simpler change than this one, although the lack of information provided by the P2P network unfortunately makes calculating the fee for a tx harder than it should be.

The arguments for it are indeed \"neater\", but I'd like to be convinced that there aren't some solutions that will allow bitcoin to work 'faster', but with some small risk, associated with zero confirmation transactions. Ultimately I feel strongly that we should't have to rely on 3rd parties to make bitcoin fast. **EDITS** => After reading more about the 'scorched earth' approach to zero conf, this patch makes a bit more sense but I'm not yet convinced of the 'scorched' approach. Seems like it hasn't been fully vetted and opens the door to other ways to convince miners to do non-standard things through fees.\n\n**Edited after reading more on the 'scorched earth' approach.\n",

      "body": "@petertodd I think mining policies should be abstracted away. So instead of replacing \"first-seen + starndard\" policy with a new \"replace-by-fee + standard\" policy, this patch could implement an abstract class Policy, extended by StandardPolicy (which reproduces the current behavior) which in turn is extended by ReplaceByFeePolicy modifying its behavior. a --policy parameter can select one of them.\nThat way the PR would be much less polemic and would also make it simpler for miners to implement their own policies. Although I'm in favor of replace-by-fee, I think a maintainable way to support several different policies may be a reasonable prerequisite for accepting a controversial policy like this one.\nThat would also open the door, for example, for a miner to implement a \"0.01 usd min fee\" policy looking at the indexes he trusts or something. Well, just an example, it would make policy innovation simpler in general.\n\n@fraggle222 \nYou can have secure 0 confirmation protocols with replace-by-fee, in fact, the majority of miners using a replace-by-fee policy makes some of those protocols more reliable or even possible. They're usually referred to as \"scorched earth\" payment protocols. Here's one example:\nhttp://ehc.ac/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/32263765/\nIn fact, the payment protocol could be extended to support them.\n",
