For example breaking the gui build, or the `--disable-wallet` build would break most dev environments, either immediately or later when debugging a `--disable-wallet` bug via git bisect. Another example would be breaking the unit tests or functional tests. Intermittent issues are excluded from here, because it is impossible to protect against them.\r\n\r\nIf, however the build is broken for a few days on a system that is not run by developers (e.g. centos 7) or alpine linux, it would not bring the development to a halt.\r\n\r\nIf more builds are added to travis, then someone needs to pay for them.
