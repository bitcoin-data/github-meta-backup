    "body": "Add Travis check to make sure unit test coverage reports stay deterministic.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nA necessary condition for meaningful line coverage measuring is that the test suite\r\nis deterministic in the sense that the set of lines executed at least once is identical between test suite runs.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses issue #14343 (MarcoFalke): \"coverage reports non-deterministic\":\r\n\r\n> Our unit tests and functional tests are non-deterministic in the overall execution, but the coverage should not be affected by that. I.e. some functions might be executed in a different order or sometimes skipped, but every line, function and branch should be executed at least once.\r\n> \r\n> This is currently not true, even for serialization errors that should be hit exactly once.\r\n> \r\n> Beside the obvious issue of missing test coverage on some runs, this also makes it impossible to see how test coverage changes between two commits.\r\n\r\nExample output in case of line coverage deterministic unit tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-06-30 08:32:59] Measuring coverage, run #1 of 3\r\n[2019-06-30 08:36:38] Measuring coverage, run #2 of 3\r\n[2019-06-30 08:40:15] Measuring coverage, run #3 of 3\r\n\r\nCoverage test passed: Deterministic coverage across 3 runs.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample output in case of line coverage non-deterministic unit tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-06-30 08:32:59] Measuring coverage, run #1 of 3\r\n[2019-06-30 08:36:38] Measuring coverage, run #2 of 3\r\n\r\nThe line coverage is non-deterministic between runs.\r\n\r\nThe test suite must be deterministic in the sense that the set of lines executed at least\r\nonce must be identical between runs.

I'm currently using `x86_64 Linux  [GOAL: install]  [bionic]  [uses qt5 dev package instead of depends Qt to speed up build and avoid timeout]`, but I'm afraid the total run-time of that job is a bit on the high end with this check included. Would it be preferable to add a new job instead of adding to an existing job? Please advice :-)",

I.e. some functions might be executed in a different order or sometimes skipped, but every line, function and branch should be executed at least once.\r\n> \r\n> This is currently not true, even for serialization errors that should be hit exactly once.\r\n> \r\n> Beside the obvious issue of missing test coverage on some runs, this also makes it impossible to see how test coverage changes between two commits.\r\n\r\nMore specifically this PR makes sure line coverage is stable between unit test runs - from the OP of this PR:\r\n\r\n> A necessary condition for meaningful line coverage measuring is that the test suite is deterministic in the sense that the set of lines executed at least once is identical between test suite runs.\r\n\r\nI've now updated the PR title to better reflect the goal of this PR.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke @sdaftuar Just to make sure we share the same goal: we all want line coverage unit tests reports to be deterministic, right? :-)",

It's demoralizing to include a test for something and then have some unrelated script break for spurious reasons that requires learning and investigating something new in order to make travis pass.\r\n\r\nSo I think I'm still a Concept NACK.  I think our concerns about line-coverage, which reflect a goal about the whole project's test suite, should not provide too much inconvenience for contributors working on a smaller piece.",
