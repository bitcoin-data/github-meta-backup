This change removes that inconsistency and adds the invariant that no coin can be spent and FRESH in any cache.\r\n\r\nThere's unlikely to be any noticeable performance change here. After all, it's very rare that we'll fetch a spent coin from a parent cache (which I'd argue is all the more reason to remove the special case code for that).\r\n\r\nI think this is an improvement to clarity, but you may be right that it's not worth changing.",

It is totally understandable that there is a bias against changes that have seemingly low impact but create a high review burden because they touch consensus code. I tend to focus on the compounding value of these changes for the far future, making it easier to understand the code for those studying it and making it less likely to introduce bugs when the code is changed again. Still, it needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis but in this case, the trade-off seems worth it for me :)",

      "body": "Thanks @robot-dreams. Excellent observation!\r\n\r\nI've updated `CCoinsViewCache::FetchCoin()` to assert that the coin returned from `GetCoin()` is not spent.\r\n\r\nI've also had to add a commit that changes the coins_tests unit test, since `CCoinsViewTest::GetCoin()` would sometimes return true even if the coin returned was empty (`IsSpent() == true`).\r\n\r\nI'm fairly confident that this is a good change, and I very much like adding invariants that remove the possibility of the program being in an inconsistent state. However, I'm going to close this PR for now since it hasn't received much attention over the year it's been open. We can always re-open it later if there's demand to clean up the coins interface. I also think if we were redesigning these interfaces now, we'd probably return a `std::optional<>` type to avoid having to return a bool _and_ have an in/out param, and also to avoid having a special `coinEmpty` marker.",
