    "body": "This allows the reindex flag to be set to auto, which automatically starts a reindex if the chain state or block index are corrupt. This can be especially useful for Raspberry Pi based full nodes, which often experience power outages or similar issues which can corrupt data.\r\n\r\nIt allows full node operators to make Bitcoin Core reindex automatically, without having to worry about removing the reindex flag again. (Which isn't much effort, but can be annoying to forget).\r\n\r\nIn case this error message is printed, pretty much nothing else except a reindex can be done, so adding this feature would make user experience slightly better.\r\n\r\nRebased version of #22072.",

      "message": "Add reindex=auto flag to automatically reindex corrupt data\n\nThis allows the reindex flag to be set to auto, which automatically starts a reindex if the chain state or block index are corrupt.\nThis can be especially useful for Raspberry Pi based full nodes, which often experience power outages or similar issues which can corrupt data.\nIt allows full node operators to make Bitcoin Core reindex automatically, without having to worry about removing the reindex flag again. (Which isn't much effort, but can be annoying to forget)\nIn case this error message is printed, pretty much nothing else except a reindex can be done, so adding this feature would make user experience slightly better.",

      "body": "> i.e some system service/watchdog that doesn't need to be a part of Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\nYes, but implementing something like this would probably be a lot more complicated than just having this feature in Bitcoin Core (It would probably work by reading log messages, but if these change, the script would need to be changed, also, such a script would also need to check if the database still needs a reindex when Core restarts).\r\n\r\n> I don't think allowing users to blindly ignore known/recurring problems and continue on, is something we should be supporting.\r\n\r\nFor some, it may be a one-time issue. And in my opinion, it could benefit node-in-a-box providers a lot. I wouldn't call that \"abusing a feature\". It definitely won't help with users having HW issues.\r\n\r\nAs a former member of the Umbrel team, I know that on such software, HW issues caused a lot of other problems. A reindex was in almost every case only needed because of a power outage, which happens sometimes, but not often for most users.",
