One-third of all logging for misbehavior should not be happening, and if the case is truly as extreme as described at the top, then alarms should be going off; better to know about it ASAP and take useful measures (setban, addnode, seednode, etc). The net logging is far too noisy to be useful unless you are specifically searching it for this or have some kind of custom, up-to-date-on-master monitoring system in place.

      "body": "Logging here was added way back in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b2864d2fb35fa85e32c76e111f8900598e0bb69d, shortly after logging categories were added (#3009). That commit also added unconditional logging to `Misbehaving()`, which has now moved to the `NET` category. I don't have a very strong opinion, but I think that these logs should probably also go in the `NET` category.\r\n\r\n> noban, addnode and local peers are still unconditionally logged (as they should), but this one can go into a category\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke: I don't understand. Can you explain why they're different?\r\n\r\n> I'm thinking of looking at the NET logging to see if we should consider creating a \"high level\" net logging category (or a \"user level\" one) as opposed to the low-level one with all of the invs and other hundreds/thousands of messages per minute. There may be objections to that which I'm not aware of, though.\r\n\r\n@jonatack: No objections. I'd take it ever further though, and add an (optional) logging severity (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR or similar) that can be added to all log messages. The user can then either choose what severity logs they want for each category (eg = `-debug=net:warning,tor:debug` etc), or have a logging post-processor that can filter by severity/category.",

Ideally, the resource usage depends on command line settings and user behaviour, not on remote peer (mis)behaviour. And with \"unsupervised\" I mean that the users doesn't check the debug log unless there is a local software malfunction or other issue that needs manual debugging.\r\n\r\nIf the suggestion is to change the policy to something else we should probably open a separate issue for that to get more participation :)\r\n\r\nThe change in this PR is perfectly in line with the current policy AFAICT.",

There may be objections to that which I'm not aware of, though.\r\n\r\n> @jonatack: No objections. I'd take it ever further though, and add an (optional) logging severity (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR or similar) that can be added to all log messages. The user can then either choose what severity logs they want for each category (eg = -debug=net:warning,tor:debug etc), or have a logging post-processor that can filter by severity/category.\r\n\r\nI'd still like this, may propose something soon :tm: \r\n",

It's hard to know--I *think* I'd be more worried about network topology here than a peer causing lots of logging, but I'm not sure if that POV is correct or shared.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of looking at the `NET` logging to see if we should consider creating a \"high level\" net logging category (or a \"user level\" one) as opposed to the low-level one with all of the invs and other hundreds/thousands of messages per minute. There may be objections to that which I'm not aware of, though.",
