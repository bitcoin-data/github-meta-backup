      "body": "Nice find on the bug and I think you've more or less identified the problem (I think I recapped it below)\r\n\r\nHowever I believe there are 2 issues with your potential fix.\r\n1) I think there is a new quadratic behavior now where if there are consistently not enough transactions in the buckets, you'll count up all the buckets to determine that, and then again all the buckets except the top one and so on...   Or some lesser variation on that if there are enough transactions at some point.  Not sure if thats actually a problem.\r\n\r\n2) I believe in your code you now only extend bucket ranges to achieve the required number of transactions, whereas the old code extended bucket ranges for that reason OR if the current buckets were failing.  It's that second condition that caused the bug because the bucket ranges didn't always match between targets, BUT I believe its important not to just eliminate that.  The reason the search for passing buckets continues even after you find a failing bucket is that you don't want to allow for the possibility that a small number of stuck transactions at a high feerate can peg fee estimates to be stuck at a high level.  Your code still solves for that, but it now completely ignores those failed transactions which I fear could lead to a different type of manipulation where a very low bucket of just enough transactions could be confirmed and it would cause the estimator to return artificially low estimates even if the vast majority of transactions at higher fee rates were not being confirmed.  \r\n\r\nI'll try to check IRC over the next few days if you want to ping me to discuss further.  A solution is not immediately apparent to me.   It's possible that the best solution is to just relax the requirement that fee rates have to be monotonically decreasing as confirmation target increases.   These are edge cases where it's not clear which answer would be better anyway.  I think the monotonic requirement was good as a QA check, but at this point may be causing more harm than good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem recap:  \r\nImagine only 2 buckets and an 85% threshold: \r\nfeerate: 100 sat/vb has 2/2 transactions confirmed within a target of 3 blocks (same within a target of 4 blocks.)\r\nfeerate: 150 sat/vb has 84/100 transactions confirmed within a target of 3 blocks and 85/100 transactions within 4 blocks.\r\n\r\nThe estimate for 3-block target fails at 150 sat/vb but passes when you add in the 100 sat/vb bucket, so it returns a median fee somewhere in the middle of those 2 buckets. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand the estimate for the 4-block target passes at 150 sat/vb, but then does not have enough data at 100 sat/vb alone and fails.  So it returns a median fee in the 150 sat/vb bucket (HIGHER than the rate for the 3-block target)",

      "body": "Ah, perhaps I misread on the quadratic issues.   \r\n\r\nNot that it really matters, but I think both of our recaps of the problem were not quite right.  In the first part of your recap, the count for sufficient number of transactions resets when a passing bucket is found so 100 sat/vb would not be passing for a 4-block target.   but you are right that in my version the 3-block target would find the median fee in the 150 bucket which would still be ok.    So yeah something like your more complicated scenario is probably what happens.\r\n\r\nWhat you've done with a5e33d3b782d33dc71653912e2d370f9a06b79e4 looks like it should work.  I'd be a little worried there is some unintended consequence though.  What I would have done in the past with a change like this is to run the fee estimator through historical transaction and block data and then look at places where the new and old differed and make sure that I thought the difference made sense.   Not sure how easy that is for anyone to do right now.",

      "body": "I don't have a ton of background on the fee estimator but understanding here is:\r\n- In `EstimateMedianVal` we group buckets together until they meet `sufficientTxVal` i.e. have enough data before we check if this range meets success rate or not. We accumulate the total txns for the current range into `totalNum` and check if there's enough.\r\n- Before, we would reset the stats if we did meet the success rate. Now, we reset every time we meet `sufficientTxVal`.\r\n\t- Past bucket ranges would be dependent on what the confirmation target is because resetting `totalNum` depends on whether success rate is met.\r\n\t- These bucket ranges are consistent regardless of what the target is, since the total number of transactions isn't different.\r\n\r\n> Here are my findings so far, this branch seems to give constantly increasing and higher estimates and i believe there is definitely something wrong with estimates for large targets.\r\n\r\n> I'm not seeing the behaviour you did (and what you saw doesn't make sense to me). For me, duplicating node state, and starting two nodes, one with this pr, and one without it, I see fee rates tracking each other pretty precisely.\r\n\r\nFwiw I hacked together a branch that implements both `EstimateMedianVal`s (i.e. master and this branch) and returns feerates using both implementations from estimatesmartfee, to eliminate differences from having slightly different mempools, timing, etc. They are giving me the same feerates every time. I cleared fee_estimates.dat, same thing. I could have implemented it wrong, but I also don't see how the huge differences could happen based on my understanding of the code.\r\n\r\nI don't have a ton of background but if this doesn't have a significant impact on fee estimates in practice, it seems worth trying. The test still fails semi-regularly (#25179, #20725, #23165).",
