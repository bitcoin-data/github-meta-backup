    "body": "This tiny PR replaces all remaining occurences of manual conversion of Satoshi amounts (`CAmount`) to a currency unit string via division and modulo operation on `COIN` (100000000) by the utility function `FormatMoney(...)`. The instances were found with the command\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit grep \"\\%[ ]*COIN\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly `ToString()`-functions are affected, but still I'd argue that the constants `COIN` should only be used:\r\n* for money constants (like in benchmark/tests, chainparams, `GetBlockSubsidy(...)` etc.) and\r\n* for utility functions that need it (like `{Parse,Format}Money`, `ValueFromAmount` etc.)\r\n\r\nNote that strictly speaking, this is not a pure refactor, as the function `FormatMoney(...)` drops excess zero after two decimal places.",

This partially does the opposite without removing the other ones, seems less clear next to the btc/kvb line, and brings in a dependency. There may be a better abstraction we can do for ToString, but I think it should handle both sat/vB and BTC/kvB and also returning both with and without the units. Ideas welcome.",

Will take a deeper look at #20391 soon (put it into my evergrowing TOREVIEW file ;-)). \r\n\r\n @practicalswift: As this PR would only change the usage in `ToString()` methods (i.e. for creating debug strings) it is not critical, but good hint anyway.\r\n\r\nNot sure what I should do with this PR, maybe it would still make sense to use `FormatMoney` in `CTxOut::ToString()` though.",
