Maybe I'm just dense, but I have a hard time reasoning about the use of the circular buffer, `buffer_pos`-based indexing, etc. \r\n\r\nWould it be simpler to have `WalletTransactionNotifier` maintain a `std::map<int, std::vector<CTransaction>> target_height_to_txns` where the key is the block height to notify at and the value are the txns to notify on? That way in `WalletTransactionNotifier::BlockConnected`, all you'd have to do is iterate through the map and evict/notify anything with a key less than or equal to the current block height. An added benefit of this approach is that you no longer have to worry about BlockConnected being reliably called for each block in order to maintain correctness.",

      "body": "(will address other comments, re: map/vec)\r\nThe tricky bits here involved being correct around chain re-orgs and I don't think a map makes that any less complex. It also doesn't let you discard the dependency on reliable invocation of the `BlockConnected` signal without introducing a lot more state, inefficient chain scanning, or discarding some of the guarantees about notification:\r\n\r\nHere's an explanation of the circular buffer approach.\r\n\r\n`n`: the number of confirmations needed for notification to occur\r\n\r\nWhen `n==1` we notify as soon as the block is mined so no state is needed.\r\n\r\nWhen `n>1` we need to keep around a state representing blocks with transactions with haven't yet been confirmed: there will be at most `n-1` of these.\r\n\r\nSince `n` is generally chosen to be a small number - and also since any node operating for sufficiently long time to observe `n` blocks will eventually have to store state of length `n-1` - we just pre-allocate a buffer with `n-1` slots. Most of the time (except for re-orgs) we will be adding a new highest height (new block) and removing the lowest height (block that has now received n confirmations and we've notified) - this is a natural fit for a circular buffer.\r\n\r\n`buffer_pos(height)`: maps every block height into a slot in this buffer with simple modulo arithmetic\r\n\r\nIf this buffer is reliably updated every time a block is connected, then it will always contain valid state for **up to** the `n-1` blocks on the active chain tip. **Up to**, and usually, but not always exactly, `n-1` because of re-orgs. In a reorg when the first block on the newly reorged chain gets connected at a height lower than the tip, we do not need to rescan any of the trailing blocks for which we no longer keep state because those have already been appropriately notified previously. We do have to maintain some bounding logic to track min/max height ranges for which we have valid state lest we accidentally send notifications for transactions in higher blocks on the re-orged out chain (b/c of the modulo based indexing into the circular buffer). With a map - you wouldn't need these min/max height bounds - but you trade that for having to explicitly clear the map for heights that are no longer needed. \r\n\r\nIn no case (map or vector) are you able to relax the constraint that `BlockConnected` must be called reliably without adding either more complex state (e.g. block hashes so you don't accidentally notify for re-orged out blocks - you won't send false notifications but you might miss some) or expensive scans of trailing blocks on every update (you wouldn't miss blocks - but it's quite inefficient and you'd either have to rescan the entire chain on startup or persist your last notified height to disk). Also there are a number of other internal components that need to have validation signals invoked reliably - so its not a new dependency.\r\n\r\nThe only other savings in logical complexity you get by substituting a map for a pre-sized vector is indexing into the structure (i.e. `map[height]` instead of `vec[buffer_pos(height)]`. \r\n\r\nOne other note here - this guarantees \"at least once\" notifications. Duplicate notifications can occur when the same blocks are connected more than once (e.g. on node restarts or chain re-orgs).",

      "body": "Thanks for the test case! The cause is rather embarrassing - due to my lack of familiarity with c++ I was calling std::vector::empty() (a boolean test for emptiness) instead of std::vector::clear() (actually empties the vector). I've fixed that and incorporated your test @jamesob and (slightly tweaked so it tests re-orgs at multiple depths)\r\n\r\nRe the concept NACK in general - if reliance on zeroconf transactions is heavily discouraged then I think its certainly worth maintaining this in the wallet. Furthermore - as @ryanofsky has pointed out in earlier comments - there are a number of other places where this sort of state tracking would benefit the wallet and for which this logic could be further utilized. One example is coinbase maturity testing which currently calls GetDepthInMainChain(). I'd also note that while the logic added might be internally complicated - there is no additional persistent state introduced and the public interface to the class is very limited - i.e. I tried to minimize as much as possible how it interacts with the rest of the wallet (i.e. most notable of these was maintaining additional internal range bounding logic in exchange for not requiring notification on BlockDisconnected() events).

      "body": "I wonder if it the concerns about code complexity would be addressed by splitting up the general purpose confirmation tracking code from the application-specific wallet notification logic. If you pulled the `notify_command_template` stuff out of `WalletTransactionNotifier` class, you could be left with a more general purpose class like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass ConfirmationTracker\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n   //! Create new confirmation tracker which invokes callbacks after a\r\n   //! specified number of confirmations.\r\n   ConfirmationTracker(int num_confirmations);\r\n\r\n   //! Register callback which will be called later when block at block_height\r\n   //! has the specified number of confirmations, or immediately if it already\r\n   //! has enough confirmations.\r\n   void addCallback(int block_height, function<void()> callback);\r\n\r\n   //! Handle new block being connected at block_height by invoking callbacks\r\n   //! registered at (block_height - num_confirmations), and dropping callbacks\r\n   //! previously registered at block_height (in case of reorgs).\r\n   void blockConnected(int block_height);\r\nprivate:\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be a standalone class which could just go in libbitcoin_util and not be tied to the wallet. This way wallet notification code would not be much more complicated than it is now, and it would also be possible to imagine extending this class and using it more places like in the GUI, zmq code, or non-wallet RPCs.",
