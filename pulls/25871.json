The code would benefit from some improvements internally, but it is of relatively high-quality.\r\n\r\n> and what goals would you be hoping to accomplish in particular in your tenure as a P2P & Networking focused maintainer?\r\n\r\nNot leave PRs that are ready for merge unmerged.\r\n\r\nI am also, always, careful to not break it. As with other modules in this project, the stake is **very** high for not breaking existent code or functionality. However, that is more for reviewers to achieve, rather than maintainers.\r\n\r\n> What should the general goals of Bitcoin Core (not Bitcoin) with respect to P2P & Networking?\r\n\r\nRemain decentralized (increasing the traffic requirements becomes a centralization factor at some point), accessible (one can run full node on a phone nowadays) and cooperative with other implementations. Encrypting P2P traffic over clearnet seems to be important.\r\n",

If this was just over the `lower level networking, sockets`, it's pretty clear you're one of the most active contributors there. However for net processing and peer interaction code, I'm not sure that's the case. Looking at some of the most significant net processing changes over the past 12 - 24 months (apologies if I've missed some):\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19219\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19398\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19607\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20624\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20651\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20799\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21186\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21515\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23443\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24170\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24171\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24178\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24545\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24571\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25268\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25515\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25720\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25717\r\n\r\n\r\nit doesn't look like you've been majorly involved in the discussion / reviewed any of them. This includes the just-merged #25717, which is probably one of the most involved changes to our p2p logic in some time (I see you left a comment with a coverage report post-merge).\r\n\r\nIt seems a little odd to me to make someone a maintainer over an area of the codebase when they don't have a history of actively writing/reviewing the code or contributing to the higher level discussion. The complexity / nuance (and the stakes) for the net processing code are high enough that I think that having separate maintainers for that the `lower level networking, sockets` is warranted.  When you look over that same group of net processing / peer interaction PRs, there is a cohort of regular contributors that I'd think would probably be better positioned to be a maintainer for it.",

      "body": "@fanquake,\r\n\r\nOftentimes I would skip reviewing a PR if there is already a crowd of reviewers on it. Why? On one hand, one more pair of eyes cannot hurt, but on the other hand I have to spend my scarce resources wisely. I know the fellows will bring the crowded PR into shape and thus it is better for me to review another one that is under-reviewed. I do not feel like every PR out there needs my fingerprints. Also, reviewers, in addition to finding strict bugs, post suggestions on how to improve the code. This is sometimes subjective. Too many reviewers and inevitably there will be contradicting suggestions which could be counter productive.\r\n\r\nThe BIP155/addrv2, Torv3, I2P and CJDNS PRs are missing from the list above. Sometimes modules are overlapping and boundaries unclear, but those should classify as high level peer interaction?\r\n\r\nSome quick stats for fun: in the last 2 years [389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02) P2P PRs/issues were opened. For any given contributor it is true that there are more than 100 PRs/issues in which the contributor neither commented nor authored them (was not involved). For example I only authored [56](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02+author%3Avasild) and commented on [150](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02+commenter%3Avasild), leaving 183 (389-56-150) ones in which I was not involved at all. That is, in addition to the 18 PRs from your list, there are 165 others which I did not touch. These numbers do not take into account the actual value brought into the project - maybe I only posted style nits suggestions? IMO they are mostly for fun and not for drawing conclusions.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

      "body": "Concept ACK vasild for Networking scope maintenance\r\n\r\nI think the low-level networking is a signficant scope in itself, I would say there are many things belonging there: CJDNS, I2P, Tor, the peers monitoring tooling, the resource consumption control settings, the sockets handling, BIP324 support, likely refactoring like #25572. Beyond, it could be fruitful to monitor more actively all the ongoing development on the [Tor mailing lists](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo), and bring on the surface if there any interesting issues affecting us. Tor is permanently [attacked](https://www.robgjansen.com/publications/pointbreak-sec2019.pdf), and Bitcoin transaction-relay target could be a target so juicy that it would change the incentives to run Tor exit nodes. It could be interesting also to explore the Tor's [pluggable transports](https://www.pluggabletransports.info/how/) (though here iirc the dissemination strategy of the entry points really differs from our assumptions underlying the p2p network and the poisson distribution of block issuance is a leak itself). The anonymity network space is like 40 years old and there are [many papers](https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/date.html) to check if we could reuse insights.\r\n\r\nThe P2P stack (block-relay, addr-relay, transaction-relay, peers connection strategy) sounds to me voluminous itself, and I think it would deserve its own maintainer. The discussions there are likely to become more and more abstract and quantitative-based. Interactions with higher layers are likely to become more tight, especially as we weight things like p2p packages or transaction-relay spam mitigations. Of course, it sounds any maintenance could become more general in time, though IMHO at the really time with the complexity of the codebase inceasing,  subsystems and their maintenance are more likely to become specialized.\r\n \r\nI don't know who is handling the labeling today, though it could be constructive to introduce a new \"Net\" label to dissociate from \"P2P\" and thus offer better visibility about low-level networking PRs towards reviewers.\r\n\r\nThanks to Vasil for offering the maintenance commitment.",

Personally, I would expect a history of reviewing these types of PRs from a proposed maintainer. I can't comfortably be on board with someone as maintainer who has not shown an interest in significant changes to the proposed module (by review or authoring).\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871#issuecomment-1235663238:\r\n> The BIP155/addrv2, Torv3, I2P and CJDNS PRs are missing from the list above. Sometimes modules are overlapping and boundaries unclear, but those should classify as high level peer interaction?\r\n\r\nI disagree, the boundaries are pretty clear here. Enabling support for Torv3, I2P and CJDNS is mostly a `net` (lower level networking, connection management, etc.) change that aligns well with a `net processing` change to enable the relay of longer address formats (i.e. BIP155/addrv2). Connecting to a i2p/Tor/cjdns address obviously works even if it is not rumored on the network, meaning the `net` changes can clearly be separated from the `net processing` ones.\r\n\r\nIMO, we have achieved a decent module boundary between `net` and `net processing`.  Maintaining that boundary as well as strengthening it, is something I would like to at least see mentioned here. Any maintainer of `net` or `net processing` who does not understand this relationship would risk entangling these layers once again.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871#issuecomment-1225679151: \r\n\r\n> It is robust. The code would benefit from some improvements internally, but it is of relatively high-quality.\r\n\r\nBy \"robust\" you mean \"it has been working for 10+ years and only with focused review attention are we able to maintain this status\"? `net processing` has close to no unit test coverage and afaict the fuzz coverage is mostly limited to a high level fuzzing target of `ProcessMessage(s)` (Aside from a couple components like `TxRequestTracker` or `TxOrphanage` which are also fuzzed. A trend that I would like to see continued!). In my view, this currently makes `net processing` quite brittle to subtle changes that humans likely won't catch, especially with long time contributors leaving and new ones joining.\r\n\r\nYou also make no distinction here between `net` and `net processing` but (imo) the state of these two modules is not quite the same.",

It makes me wonder if the nominee has the time to be a maintainer if resources are scarce.\r\n\r\nAlmost every maintainer is involved in more than just bitcoin core, have a life and there is nothing wrong with time management.\r\n\r\n> Maybe but maybe not. A maintainer in name who is not involved enough could cause more problems than not. Not to mention having additional access which is a security consideration as well.\r\n\r\nDisagree with this and looking at the pull requests authored or reviewed by _vasild_, I would consider him a good maintainer for P2P and privacy related pull requests. Scoping is useless when every maintainer eventually will be a general maintainer and pull requests are merged after review or its always possible to comment later if you see anything wrong.",

      "body": "I'm not exactly sure where there is going. Challenge is fine but it becomes a bit of a joke when someone like @vasild who has been very active in this repo for a sustained period, clearly has expertise in the scope described and brings a vast amount of experience as a software engineer prior to this project is asked to jump through these ill defined hoops. It has been brought up [previously](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524#issuecomment-1172570635) that new maintainers on this project are increasingly young, inexperienced and arguably lacking the wisdom and versatility that comes through working in industry or external projects for many years prior.\r\n\r\n> Oftentimes I would skip reviewing a PR if there is already a crowd of reviewers on it\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of thing that I would like to see from an experienced, versatile reviewer. Rather than getting their name on a PR that is already under review by a crowd of reviewers, seeking out the PRs that aren't getting attention is a positive attribute. There is room for different approaches (ultra focused on a single scope versus moving across different scopes) but highlighting the ability to add value outside of their scope as a negative seems absurd to me. It is a recipe for PRs falling between cracks because maintainers are unwilling or unable to add value outside of what they consider their scope.\r\n\r\n> It makes me wonder if the nominee has the time to be a maintainer if resources are scarce.\r\n\r\nA nonsense comment. Resources are scarce for every single maintainer, reviewer and indeed on this project in its entirety. If resources weren't scarce we would have open PRs in single digits. PR review is and always will be a bottleneck on this project.\r\n\r\n> A maintainer in name who is not involved enough could cause more problems than not. Not to mention having additional access which is a security consideration as well.\r\n\r\nThis is uninformed and frankly insulting to all the work @vasild has been doing. If you have anything to provide as evidence that suggests @vasild might pose a security risk to this project then please provide it. Otherwise he falls into the same bracket as all other current maintainers in that there was no evidence prior to them being added as a maintainer that they posed a security risk.\r\n\r\nDiscussing interlocking scopes and where the gaps are in terms of current maintainers' skillsets is fine. But can we refrain from uninformed criticism of individuals' work and abilities and certainly throwing around \"security risk\" accusations with zero evidence to back it up. It certainly isn't a recipe for attracting experienced developers to this project with expertise in areas we may be lacking.",

I have met @vasild personally and I didn't mean to offend him nor the contributions he has made.  I had meant to voice concern that it seems a maintainer position is a large commitment and could be  bad for the project and the individual if they are over stretched or not prepared.  That's only my opinion, nothing more.\r\n\r\n> This is indeed an improvement over the no-p2p-maintainer status quo\r\n\r\nAgain, my reaction to this comment was not to say talk badly about @vasild.  I just wanted to point out that choosing any maintainer is better than no maintainer is not necessarily helpful.\r\n\r\nI disagree with how you interpret my comments, however thank you for challenging my post in case others interrupt it the same way.",

Does he need to go in-person to a CoreDev.tech-type event to make the case (although the stated goals of that initiative say no politicking welcome).\r\n\r\nWould be great to get this out of limbo.",

I do think though that @vasild has demonstrated he can add value outside whatever his eventual scope is.\r\n\r\n> a thought: the past few years vasild, laanwj, and myself have been working on or reviewing a large-ish chunk of net code that few others have been. i believe sipa knows the code well, too, along with (maybe) a couple others. laanwj has been merging these changes. so it makes sense to me that one of these would maintain ([jonatack](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-08-18.html#l-299))\r\n\r\nWithout laanwj, sipa as maintainers we don't have too many options with deep experience of this part of the codebase so I hope this isn't stuck for a long period of time.",

Bitcoin Core maintainers have more respect, privileges, responsibilities etc. even if we consider it 'janitorial'. Sometimes even in soft forks indirectly. Its mainly because Bitcoin has only one implementation used by majority of nodes. I am not sure about other countries but in my country, some elections are open for everyone and others are decided by people who are elected and closed door meetings between them.\r\n\r\nI don't think we are trying to create a similar system and most of the people are interested in coding rather than politics. However, it has become a part of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core for a few reasons that are irrelevant to discuss here. I was even asked to [not comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25560#discussion_r922216780) in a PR by @michaelfolkson however, I still agree with his comments in this PR.\r\n\r\n1. Scope is edited if it really matters: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871#issuecomment-1268085277\r\n2. Please don't insult the only 5-10 developers that focus on privacy in bitcoin as @michaelfolkson said  based on contributions:\r\n   >This is uninformed and frankly insulting to all the work @vasild has been doing. If you have anything to provide as evidence that suggests @vasild might pose a security risk to this project then please provide it. Otherwise he falls into the same bracket as all other current maintainers in that there was no evidence prior to them being added as a maintainer that they posed a security risk.",

Obviously you can only speak for yourself and not for others.\r\n\r\npersonally, no I don't think so; also I mostly agree with [dergoegge](https://github.com/dergoegge).\r\n\r\nThere are a myriad of issues in the networking stack that I think should be addressed, and so I'd like to see someone with more dissatisfaction ==> ambition to fix those issues, or at least a set of issues they think are compelling and have a plan for. To the extent we're adding a maintainer for networking, I would expect them to express more vision and leadership around how the module should be improved and how the goals (including stated ones around encryption) will be able to be moved forward meaningfully. \r\n\r\nI also strongly disagree with @vasild's statement:\r\n\r\n> I am also, always, careful to not break it. As with other modules in this project, the stake is very high for not breaking existent code or functionality. However, that is more for reviewers to achieve, rather than maintainers.\r\n\r\nFrom bitcoincore.org\r\n\r\n> Project maintainers have commit access and are responsible for merging patches from contributors. They perform a janitorial role merging patches that the team agrees should be merged. They also act as a final check to ensure that patches are safe and in line with the project goals. The maintainers’ role is by agreement of project contributors.\r\n\r\nIf a maintainer doesn't believe that maintainers are doing a final check of safety, then that's misunderstanding what contributors currrently expect a maintainer should do before merging.",

This isn't a complex PR to review, you either think @vasild has proved himself capable enough to be a maintainer over years of sustained contributions or he hasn't. You are free to suggest a tweak to the scope if that is what is delaying your response.\r\n\r\n(edit: I looked up to see how long glozow's trusted keys [PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524) took to get merged. It was opened on July 1st and was merged on July 7th after discussion of some people's reservations, a couple of initial NACKs and some unmet requests for phone calls etc. So 6 days from opening to merging. 3 months seems like an excessively long time for such a PR to be open to me.)",

If that is indeed the case (rather than just seeking attention on pull requests and adding noise for all the contributors to this repo) I would expect you to be interested in why it hasn't been merged after approximately 3 months and what the remaining maintainers are thinking with regards to this pull request. That is what I have enquired about. Changing the subject or increasing the scope of the pull request discussion, whether you know it or not, is harmful to your supposed aim of getting this PR merged.\r\n\r\nI am not forcing anyone to do anything. But by taking on the responsibility of maintainership releases are within the maintainers' remit and I don't think it is unreasonable to request comment on a PR for adding a new maintainer that has a large number of ACKs (including from a majority of the maintainers) and has been open for almost 3 months. Obviously the release takes priority currently but once that is completed I hope (and presumably you hope too) to hear from them.",

      "body": "Renewing my Concept ACK vasild for Networking scope maintenance.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm listening to other contributors concerns that maintainers should express some leadership and vision in the handling of their module(s) maintenance, from my opinion this will be a notifiable change in the project culture. As of today, I think the majority of the contributors opinions is to understand maintenance as a janitorial role rather than as a \"project manager\" one. That the project could benefit from more priorities communication and active coordination by and from the contributors is something for sure we can discuss, however I believe it's beyond the scope of this specific appointment proposal to vasild as a maintainer.\r\n\r\nOf course, we could still devise for an unbounded period of time what should be the current role description and all the tasks that a maintainer candidate should be evaluated to be competent to perform. However, I think this is coming in a relative blindness of the fast-evolving and highly-dynamic environment that Bitcoin open-source protocol development constitutes. I would say our design, development and release process are continuously changing and adapting to the reality of the ecosystem, e.g as the recent discussions about mempool policy changes shown up, and as such maintenance is hard to be understood as a strictly fixed set of tasks, at least from my perspective. Daily practice and initiative mindset trump over a pinned job description in FOSS.  \r\n\r\nAll that in consideration, I don't think we should save us from better defining the scope between \"Networking\" and \"P2P\" functional modules and logical boundaries, even if in the light of today's state of the codebase there is a lot of intertwined code and functions. Again, I would like to underscore a new label \"net\" would be a productivity gain by ensuring better review scope.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think we should be fairly liberal in our nomination of maintainers when the volunteering is coming from an experienced and established contributor. Technical knowledge gaps can be improved with dedicated time, and I hold the belief we can be clearly open-minded on someone learning the job on the trade. Somehow, we're all responsible to provide feedback towards maintainers in the performance of their tasks and to improve our process in a collaborative and constructive way.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm grateful we still have contributors step in to volunteer for project maintenance. As we all know, a janitorial role which is both a curse and a blessing.",

I feel like Gloria's trusted keys merge was rushed through and I can only speculate on the reasons why. I feel like this merge has been deliberately stalled for months and I can only speculate on the reasons why. I'm still waiting on @fanquake and/or @glozow to comment despite multiple requests for them to do so.\r\n\r\nI don't think we want to open the floodgates to everyone being a maintainer and the bar for adding a new maintainer should be very high. If I'm honest I would have liked the bar to have been higher for Gloria before she was made maintainer but I can understand why many people were enthusiastic for her to be made maintainer as soon as possible. (I ACKed her PR also).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion as the remaining maintainers @fanquake and @glozow should comment on this PR. Individually they should ACK this PR **or** they should clearly state what they expect from @vasild before they feel comfortable ACKing this PR **or** they should clearly state why they don't think @vasild should be made a maintainer now or potentially ever. Until they do that they are wasting my time and everybody else's who receives notifications from this repository or who follows the mailing list. I don't want to spend 2023 regularly checking back on this PR wondering what is happening.\r\n\r\nedit: If either @glozow or @fanquake want to chat privately I'm happy to via DM on IRC or via phone/video call. The offer is there if either of them want it.",

      "body": "Some comments from the IRC meeting that reflects how process of adding maintainers in this project has FAILED:\r\n\r\n[19:12](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-01-12#883702) <sipa> _Previous maintainers were also all selected because existing maintainers saw a need, and nominated somewhere. It's unclear to me where this is coming from here._\r\n\r\n1. Everyone is aware p2p and net modules have no maintainers since @sipa and @laanwj stepped down as maintainers\r\n2. Adding @vasild as new maintainer was ACKed by 3 present maintainers. Why would they do it if there isn't any need? Even @fanquake who had some disagreement never mentioned there isn't any need.\r\n\r\n[19:13](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-01-12#883704) <achow101> _from what I can tell, I believe the concern is the lack of addressing the specific concerns brought up in_ https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871#issuecomment-1257032315\r\n\r\n1. Scope was changed after this comment in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871#issuecomment-1268085277\r\n2. Commenter had no issues if this pull request is merged later https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871#issuecomment-1357917345 (Similar to some disagreements in PR that added last maintainer's keys)\r\n\r\n[19:10](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-01-12#883696) <achow101> _however, this is basically new territory for us, as far as I can remember, all previous maintainers were added without any disagreement at all_\r\n\r\nPrevious maintainer was added with some disagreements. Even if this is a new territory it needs to be resolved instead of ignoring and moving on.\r\n\r\n[19:16](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-01-12#883715) <_aj_> _next steps? stop trying to make vasild a maintainer when there's no particular need, work on making good PRs and reviewing them_\r\n\r\n[19:20](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-01-12#883735) <_aj_> _i've only found it hard to get review of changes in net; not merges once review's passed._\r\n\r\n[19:20](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-01-12#883736) <_aj_> _this entire topic seems much more like it's following https://www.openculture.com/2022/01/read-the-cias-simple-sabotage-field-manual.html rather than trying to solve actual problems to me_\r\n\r\n- Bitcoin Core needs a maintainer for p2p/net module. Some maintainers agree with the 'need' part and this has nothing to do with making good PRs or reviewing which is true for all modules including mempool\r\n- Bitcoin Core lacks reviewers overall and this has nothing to do with adding of new maintainer as it was done for other modules\r\n- Accusing others of sabotaging when they ask real questions about the politics and issues with adding new maintainer wont solve any problems\r\n\r\n[19:23](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-01-12#883743) <achow101> _I could just nack and close the pr if it makes you feel better ..._\r\n\r\nDid not expect this comment from @achow101\r\n\r\n[19:25](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-01-12#883748) <achow101> _frankly, I think opinions aren't being shared because of potential backlash from aggressive users such as yourself and bytes1440000_\r\n\r\nThis is an excuse. If someone wants to be transparent and share their opinions in public, there is nothing stopping them. If you can share disagreement in a pull request or other pull requests there is nothing special in this case. Not sharing opinion has stalled this PR and affected the process. Not signs of responsible maintainers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf interested to help in improving the process and start with some documentation, please review https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26868",

Or do you think there shouldn't be a P2P maintainer added in the next x months or y years? To be respectful to @vasild there has to be some guidance. Currently he is sitting there with no clue what is going on (presumably, I haven't spoken to him).

      "body": "Here are my thoughts on the purpose and benefits of a maintainer scope, my personal framework for deciding whether trusted-key is appropriate, and why I have neither ACKed nor NACKed this.\r\n\r\nA key to merge things is a *tool*, not a badge indicating someone is special. Software maintenance includes much more than merging PRs - making sure security issues are addressed, bugs are fixed, the repo is a productive place for development, etc. - and Bitcoin Core is too broad in scope for one person to do all of it. However, having lots of \"general maintainers\" can be like having lots of cooks in a kitchen without deciding who does what. Adding more cooks does not help as much as dividing up tasks does.\r\n\r\nSplitting based on areas of code is a sensible method, hence the idea of a maintainer scope. It means that, apart from helping generally with maintenance, any PR, issue, or security question that falls under a given area is automatically delegated to this maintainer to triage, review, and merge. This makes individuals' roles more manageable, while fewer things fall through the cracks and merge decisions are of higher quality. Bitcoin Core has many stuck PRs due to lack of thorough *review*, not a lack of ACKs or lack of people to push the merge button. In fact, I would say a more important role of a maintainer is to understand when to *not* merge a PR that has any number of ACKs. If this is surprising to you because you thought it was 1 github account 1 vote, you are setting the bar for Bitcoin Core too low. Merging based solely on votes is not \"decentralized,\" it's just irresponsible.\r\n\r\nI think a p2p maintainer would be extremely valuable, as in, one or more persons X such that:\r\n- X has a good understanding of p2p - they have a mental model of what its design goals are, what known issues exist, what problems should be prioritized, etc.\r\n- Given a p2p-related security disclosure, X would be able to assess its severity, know how to fix it, and who else to consult.\r\n- X reviews most things in p2p, both identifying bugs and helping projects make progress. If something had 5 ACKs and X said it was conceptually flawed, I wouldn't merge it.\r\n\r\nIn that case, I think (just me - I am not recommending this as a formal framework) X contributes to the maintenance Bitcoin Core and a key to merge PRs is an appropriate tool to continue doing so, assuming they accept that responsibility. For me, @vasild isn't this person (maybe he is for somebody else, or will be in the future), which is why I have not ACKed this.\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with how skilled or deserving I think Vasil is. Thank you very much for your contributions.\r\n\r\nI had not NACKed this either because my opinion could change over time, NACKs are sometimes needlessly interpreted as personal attacks, and Brink has been antagonized on Twitter each time multiple grantees have similar opinions about this. So I'll add that if you wish to have more decentralization in Bitcoin Core funding, you can start by creating a nonprofit, gathering donations, and funding somebody who works on Bitcoin Core.",

      "body": "NACK\r\n\r\nIn addition to my own analysis, I've also reached out to several contributors privately to form this opinion. While vasild has done great work and review in networking parts of the codebase, I don't think he is currently a good fit to be a maintainer. I also do not think a maintainer looking in the network or P2P area is needed at this time.\r\n\r\nMy primary concern is on some of his statements regarding review of PRs. While maintainership is largely a janitorial role, that does not mean it is automatable or follows a set of specific rules. There are judgement calls that need to be made, and these involve looking at and scrutinizing a PR that may be ready to be merged. This means potentially providing a detailed review of it that may prevent it from being merged even if there are multiple ACKs. Personally, I try to understand the code and ACK it before I merge it, and I hope that other maintainers do the same. What concerns me are some of the statements that vasild has made in this thread regarding review, for example:\r\n\r\n> Oftentimes I would skip reviewing a PR if there is already a crowd of reviewers on it. Why? On one hand, one more pair of eyes cannot hurt, but on the other hand I have to spend my scarce resources wisely. \r\n\r\n> I know the fellows will bring the crowded PR into shape and thus it is better for me to review another one that is under-reviewed.\r\n\r\n> As with other modules in this project, the stake is very high for not breaking existent code or functionality. However, that is more for reviewers to achieve, rather than maintainers.\r\n\r\nThese statements, coupled with\r\n\r\n> Not leave PRs that are ready for merge unmerged.\r\n\r\nsuggest to me that vasild may expect to just look at the ACKers and ACK counts of a PR and then merge it if it meets a particular threshold. If that is what we wanted, we would just use a bot to do that rather than having people who have expertise in an area become a maintainer. One of the jobs a maintainer should be doing is actual review of the PRs to be merged, and based on these statements, I'm not confident that vasild would be doing that.\r\n\r\nThis is not to disparage vasild's work or his reviews. His work and reviews are useful and valuable. But the attitudes towards review need to be different between maintainers and reviewers. Maintainers inherently need to look at the things that everyone else has already looked at, if only to give it a final once over before merging (but hopefully, an actual review, not just looking it over). So an attitude of \"it already has lots of eyes so I don't need to\" does not sit well with me.\r\n\r\nI also want to mention that the people who have become maintainers in the past have had this kind of maintainer attitude towards review prior to becoming a maintainer. The maintainers would often look for reviews from these people to determine whether something was ready to be merged. These people would often call out which PRs are ready to be merged so that the maintainers could do that. They were reviewing a wide assortment of PRs. They were, in effect, doing maintainer duties without having the actual permissions to do the merges themselves.\r\n\r\nA few people may think that these \"requirements\" are new, but I wouldn't say that they are. Previous maintainer additions were almost always foregone conclusions. They largely were the obvious choise to be a maintainer with a focus in some area because of the way that they were reviewing and calling for things to be merged. I think this is the first time that we have had a maintainer nominee who I did not think was an obvious choice for the position. Although I initially Concept ACK'd the proposal, that was more of a \"I guess so\" rather than a \"duh, that's the obvious choice\". Since this is the first time for me that I did not consider a nominee to be the obvious candidate for maintainership, it has taken a while for me to articulate why I feel this way.\r\n\r\nLastly, I don't think we need another maintainer, regardless of scope. Having looked (briefly) at every single PR in this repo, there aren't really any PRs that look like they are ready to be merged that haven't been merged. As always, the bottleneck is really in doing review. Adding a maintainer doesn't change that. In terms of the proposed scope of networking, it doesn't seem like there has been any net related PRs that were ready and not merged for a while. Personally I've been branching out and looking at PRs outside of my nominal scope, and I thnk the other maintainers have been doing this as well. It does not feel like there is a lack of merging of PRs in that scope, but I don't work there actively so please correct me if that's wrong.",

      "body": "Closing this as it is not going to be merged at the moment. Doing so feels like failing all the people who ACKed it, sorry.\r\n\r\nI may reopen it in the future, if dynamics change.\r\n\r\n@achow101, merging PRs based on ACK count is pretty dump, I think this is so obviously wrong that it has not even been discussed. At the same time reviewing every PR that a maintainer merges is unrealistic. To use the numbers from my comment [above](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871#issuecomment-1235663238):\r\n\r\n> in the last 2 years [389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02) P2P PRs/issues were opened. For any given contributor it is true that there are more than 100 PRs/issues in which the contributor neither commented nor authored them (was not involved). For example I only authored [56](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02+author%3Avasild) and commented on [150](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02+commenter%3Avasild), leaving 183 (389-56-150) ones in which I was not involved at all.\r\n\r\nI work on this full time and have been one of the most active contributors. Even with that, I only touched about half of the net/p2p PRs (~200 from ~400). Most other contributors touched less than 100 PRs (from ~400). I didn't keep the exact stats, but they can be retrieved from github to confirm.\r\n\r\nSo, the point is to be able to judge by just briefly looking. I hope existent maintainers can do that with net/p2p PRs, given that they have not been very active in that area.\r\n\r\nUnmerged PRs is a sign that a maintainer is needed, but the lack of unmerged PRs does not necessary mean that a maintainer is not needed (you know, from `A=>B` does not follow that `!A=>!B`). Prematurely merged PRs are a bigger danger, more subtle and difficult to spot. I second @glozow's [comment above](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871#issuecomment-1381654564) \"... important role of a maintainer is to understand when to not merge a PR ...\"\r\n\r\nLastly, I do not take any of this personally and I respect all of your opinions, even if I don't agree with some of them.\r\n\r\n> I still think vasild would be the most suitable maintainer choice for net code, and if there were to be a maintainer added he'd be the best choice.\r\n\r\n@laanwj, that means a lot, thank you! :heart: \r\n",
