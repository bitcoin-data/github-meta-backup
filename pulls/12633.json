On a technical level, this change reduces the number of possible soft fork deployments from 29 to 13, so functionality is actually being diminished. The _only_ beneficiary is the company owned by OP, which sells hardware implementing the patented version rolling ASICBOOST being standardized by this pull request and associated BIP.\r\n\r\nWithout this, the company is likely to face a public relations nightmare when their use of the patented version roll triggers warnings for full node operators, as it rightly should. Bitcoin Core should not exist to help standardize patented tech, or aid in it's use. At the very least this should *not* be the default behavior. It's hard to not see how this pull request being merged would not significantly benefit the OP and his business. I ask you to consider if it where BITMAIN that had this optimization in their hardware, and they created a similar pull request.",

      "body": "@Cobra-Bitcoin , are you taking this into account ?\r\nhttps://www.asicboost.com/single-post/2018/03/01/opening-asicboost-for-defensive-use/\r\n\r\nBitmain already has asicboost in their hardware as we all know, but their implementation of covert asicboost only hurts the network (small blocks, incompatible with witness commitment).  If they were to propose this same proposal of overt boost then I would be very much for it, taking into account the DPL.  I don't believe the reduction from 29 to 13 concurrent soft forks is an issue, and even more so - I believe giving any miner a say in soft fork deployment is inherently broken, so nversion's use in soft fork deployment is even less of a concern for me.",
