    "body": "This pull does three things:\r\n\r\nA. It displays the version message before any disconnect logic, for debugging/logging purposes.\r\n\r\nB.1. It disconnects when it encounters irrelevant services rather than unexpected services. For example, it might have expected BLOOM services or XTHIN services, but these should not be reasons to disconnect. The criteria for disconnection should be the same as for selection, i.e. nRelevantServices, which this pull now uses. It will still log unexpected services, out of curiosity.\r\n\r\nB.2. It makes disconnection conditional on irrelevant services only on OUTBOUND connections. i.e. it restores the functionality to allow clients to connect to us, e.g. SPV nodes.\r\n\r\nC. It fixes an ambiguity in the code which led me to thinking that nExpectedServices were the services advertised by the node. They weren't, they were a subset when ANDed with the nRelevantServices, which made the 2nd commit redundant, and took away the ability to log when services are not as expected, which is now possible.\r\n",

      "body": "@sipa @gmaxwell Ok, I have changed this pull to address the issues. It is now two commits as I felt this was appropriate given it achieves two things. Firstly, it displays the version message prior to any disconnection logic. Secondly, it disconnects when an outgoing connection discovers irrelevant (rather than unexpected) services, as I believe was the intention, using the nRelevantServices variable as this is designed for. It also logs when a node provides unexpected services, but as long as those unexpected services are still relevant, it does not disconnect - as I can't imagine we would want this - for example, just because you get a cherry on top of your cake doesn't mean you will want to throw away the cake.\r\n\r\nI hope the logic behind this is clear, but if not, please ask/comment/etc.\r\n",

It is not called nRequiredServices.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows: when selecting a peer to connect to, we pick based on their assumed services. Then we set the CNode::nServicesExpected based on that knowledge intersected with nRelevantServices. When the node later does not turn out to have all the flags in nServicesExpected, we disconnect, because apparently we did not connect to the node with the properties they claimed to have. This lets us move the decision criteria to the selection loop, rather than decide ad-hoc after connecting.\n",
