    "body": "Currently when we load a wallet, we just iterate through all of the records in the database and add them completely statelessly. However we have some records which do rely on other records being loaded before they are. To deal with this, we use `CWalletScanState` to hold things temporarily until all of the records have been read and then we load the stateful things.\r\n\r\nHowever this can be slow, and with some future improvements, can cause some pretty drastic slowdowns to retain this pattern. So this PR changes the way we load records by choosing to load the records in a particular order. This lets us do things such as loading a descriptor record, then finding and loading that descriptor's cache and key records. In the future, this will also let us use `IsMine` when loading transactions as then `IsMine` will actually be working as we now always load keys and descriptors before transactions.\r\n\r\nIn order to get records of a specific type, this PR includes some refactors to how we do database cursors. Functionality is also added to retrieve a cursor that will give us records beginning with a specified prefix.\r\n\r\nLastly, one thing that iterating the entire database let us do was to find unknown records. However even if unknown records were found, we would not do anything with this information except output a number in a log line. With this PR, we would no longer be aware of any unknown records. This does not change functionality as we don't do anything with unknown records, and having unknown records is not an error. Now we would just not be aware that unknown records even exist.",

Solved here: https://github.com/furszy/bitcoin/commit/558fcb0c56cb0b50a8dd2c76ed216bb0ed2af58a.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The main thing would be making the \"walletdb: refactor X loading\" commits self contained and not leave behind dead code that needs to be cleaned up later. It's hard to identify what code is being replaced in current commits when not all the code being replaced is actually removed.\r\n2. I think it might be good to move first 2 commits up to \"wallet: Add GetPrefixCursor to DatabaseBatch\" (422a8436089c844934903a61fcec6b7b93995c07) to a different PR. Those commits require a different kind of review than the rest of the PR, and I suspect there are probably wallet developers who'd be perfectly comfortable reviewing the rest of the PR but less comfortable acking the lower level bdb & sqlite code there.\r\n\r\nI left a bunch of review comments, but also posted a branch https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/review.24914.9-edit with suggested changes to fix up the \"refactor X loading commits\"",

It's hard to identify what code is being replaced in current commits when not all the code being replaced is actually removed.\r\n\r\nI've implemented your suggestions and some additional dead code cleanups.\r\n\r\n>   2. I think it might be good to move first 2 commits up to \"wallet: Add GetPrefixCursor to DatabaseBatch\" ([422a843](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/422a8436089c844934903a61fcec6b7b93995c07)) to a different PR. Those commits require a different kind of review than the rest of the PR, and I suspect there are probably wallet developers who'd be perfectly comfortable reviewing the rest of the PR but less comfortable acking the lower level bdb & sqlite code there.\r\n\r\n#27790\r\n",

There's a tradeoff but in this case it seems better to make the API implementation a little more complex if it can avoid making API usage more complex or error prone.",

For example if you are looking for keys with prefix `X'FFFF'`, the right condition to check for is simply `key >= X'FFFF'`. It is not `key >= X'FFFF' AND key < X'01FFFF'`.\r\n\r\nYou could fix this by replacing this line with `end_range.clear()`. Then in the `end_range.empty()` case below, prepare the SQL statement `WHERE key >= {begin_range}` instead of `WHERE key >= {begin_range} AND key < {end_range}`.\r\n\r\nThis would fix the prefix scan for prefixes that consist of `0xff` bytes. It would also fix the prefix scan for empty prefixes (by returning all rows), so you could drop the `if (prefix.empty()) return nullptr;` error above too.\r\n\r\nRelated to this, I previously implemented an sqlite prefix scan more simply using the sqlite `instr` function in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7a05b1dee2fa68b32bfb19e273fb55a5b3836a3e#diff-d43e46c8f7010dde905ec31057a1c5c2674df9be11683f98a21546377f2cd706 from #18608. But probably the approach in this PR is more efficient, unless the sql interpreter is doing some fancy rewriting.\r\n",

Right now, some flows return due corruption right after finish reading all the records of one type, while others continue for a bit longer.\r\n\r\nI'm just not so convinced that worth to log all corrupted records. I don't see much of a benefit for the user, might worth for debugging but in that case, might be better to have an RPC command or an external tool that scans the .dat file and dumps overall info about the wallet (including the corrupted info etc).\r\n\r\nBut no problem, all good if it's to preserve the current behavior. This PR is already doing a lot. Let's keep moving forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSide not, I just had a dejavú. Most likely, we had this convo earlier in the PR and I forgot it..

BDB will malloc a new pointer whether or not you not pass DB_DBT_MALLOC. But you pass it, you are responsible for freeing the pointer, and if you don't pass it, BDB will manage the memory as part of the cursor object so you don't have to free it yourself. If you don't want BDB to malloc memory to return the key, you can pass it a different DB_DBT_USERMEM flag instead.\r\n\r\nThis does raises the question of whether it is ok to call memory_cleanse on memory that is owned by the cursor and should probably be read-only. But maybe it doesn't need to be read-only, or doesn't need to be read-only as long as you are done with the key and about to advance the cursor.",

It would be good to note this in the commit message for this commit.",

This would make the database code less fragile and basically catch same programming errors at a higher level in the wallet.",
