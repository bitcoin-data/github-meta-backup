As the compiler can't know that B isn't a reference to an object of a class C that derives from B, it has to emit the vtable lookup. But in many cases, analysis can show that this B variable points to an object of type B exactly (especially if it was constructed within the same module). If adding `final` does not change the binary, I guess that for all cases where it was introduced, the compiler was already able to infer enough. Note that there are more classes were `final` could apply.",
