The implementation of LOCK_ASSERTION as it stands will cause compile errors if you use the wrong assertion. I think you're completely mistaken in thinking LOCK_ASSERTION looks \"safer\" than \"AssertLockHeld\".\r\n\r\n>     * Unclear why it's called a \"quick fix\". It's basically the same size as #19918 except it has fewer comments and an incomplete description with no stated rationale\r\n\r\nIt's a \"fix\" because it corrects obviously broken behaviour, and it's \"quick\" because it leaves the issues where there's debate about what to do them to be addressed elsewhere. This isn't an \"alternative\" to other approaches as you suggest in your edit to the PR description, it's just a first step.",
