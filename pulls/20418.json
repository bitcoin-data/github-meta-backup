      "diff_hunk": "@@ -60,422 +55,9 @@ From Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\n longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\n when macOS \"dark mode\" is activated.\n \n-The node's known peers are persisted to disk in a file called `peers.dat`. The\n-format of this file has been changed in a backwards-incompatible way in order to\n-accommodate the storage of Tor v3 and other BIP155 addresses. This means that if\n-the file is modified by 0.21.0 or newer then older versions will not be able to\n-read it. Those old versions, in the event of a downgrade, will log an error\n-message \"Incorrect keysize in addrman deserialization\" and will continue normal\n-operation as if the file was missing, creating a new empty one. (#19954)\n-\n Notable changes\n ===============\n \n-P2P and network changes\n------------------------\n-\n-- The mempool now tracks whether transactions submitted via the wallet or RPCs\n-  have been successfully broadcast. Every 10-15 minutes, the node will try to\n-  announce unbroadcast transactions until a peer requests it via a `getdata`\n-  message or the transaction is removed from the mempool for other reasons.\n-  The node will not track the broadcast status of transactions submitted to the\n-  node using P2P relay. This version reduces the initial broadcast guarantees\n-  for wallet transactions submitted via P2P to a node running the wallet. (#18038)\n-\n-- The size of the set of transactions that peers have announced and we consider\n-  for requests has been reduced from 100000 to 5000 (per peer), and further\n-  announcements will be ignored when that limit is reached. If you need to dump\n-  (very) large batches of transactions, exceptions can be made for trusted\n-  peers using the \"relay\" network permission. For localhost for example it can\n-  be enabled using the command line option `-whitelist=relay@127.0.0.1`.\n-  (#19988)\n-\n-- The Tor onion service that is automatically created by setting the\n-  `-listenonion` configuration parameter will now be created as a Tor v3 service\n-  instead of Tor v2. The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be\n-  left untouched in the `onion_private_key` file in the data directory (see\n-  `-datadir`) and can be removed if not needed. Bitcoin Core will no longer\n-  attempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a\n-  file named `onion_v3_private_key`. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not\n-  recommended), then `onion_private_key` can be copied over\n-  `onion_v3_private_key`, e.g.\n-  `cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key`. (#19954)\n-\n-Updated RPCs\n-------------\n-\n-- The `getpeerinfo` RPC now has additional `last_block` and `last_transaction`\n-  fields that return the UNIX epoch time of the last block and the last valid\n-  transaction received from each peer. (#19731)\n-\n-- `getnetworkinfo` now returns two new fields, `connections_in` and\n-  `connections_out`, that provide the number of inbound and outbound peer\n-  connections. These new fields are in addition to the existing `connections`\n-  field, which returns the total number of peer connections. (#19405)\n-\n-- Exposed transaction version numbers are now treated as unsigned 32-bit\n-  integers instead of signed 32-bit integers. This matches their treatment in\n-  consensus logic. Versions greater than 2 continue to be non-standard\n-  (matching previous behavior of smaller than 1 or greater than 2 being\n-  non-standard). Note that this includes the joinpsbt command, which combines\n-  partially-signed transactions by selecting the highest version number.\n-  (#16525)\n-\n-- `getmempoolinfo` now returns an additional `unbroadcastcount` field. The\n-  mempool tracks locally submitted transactions until their initial broadcast\n-  is acknowledged by a peer. This field returns the count of transactions\n-  waiting for acknowledgement.\n-\n-- Mempool RPCs such as `getmempoolentry` and `getrawmempool` with\n-  `verbose=true` now return an additional `unbroadcast` field. This indicates\n-  whether initial broadcast of the transaction has been acknowledged by a\n-  peer. `getmempoolancestors` and `getmempooldescendants` are also updated.\n-\n-- The `bumpfee`, `fundrawtransaction`, `sendmany`, `sendtoaddress`, and `walletcreatefundedpsbt`\n-RPC commands have been updated to include two new fee estimation methods \"BTC/kB\" and \"sat/B\".\n-The target is the fee expressed explicitly in the given form. Note that use of this feature\n-will trigger BIP 125 (replace-by-fee) opt-in. (#11413)\n-\n-- In addition, the `estimate_mode` parameter is now case insensitive for all of\n-  the above RPC commands. (#11413)\n-\n-- The `bumpfee` command now uses `conf_target` rather than `confTarget` in the\n-  options. (#11413)\n-\n-- The `getpeerinfo` RPC no longer returns the `banscore` field unless the configuration\n-  option `-deprecatedrpc=banscore` is used. The `banscore` field will be fully\n-  removed in the next major release. (#19469)\n-\n-- The `testmempoolaccept` RPC returns `vsize` and a `fees` object with the `base` fee\n-  if the transaction would pass validation. (#19940)\n-\n-- The `getpeerinfo` RPC now returns a `connection_type` field. This indicates\n-  the type of connection established with the peer. It will return one of six\n-  options. For more information, see the `getpeerinfo` help documentation.\n-  (#19725)\n-\n-- The `getpeerinfo` RPC no longer returns the `addnode` field by default. This\n-  field will be fully removed in the next major release.  It can be accessed\n-  with the configuration option `-deprecatedrpc=getpeerinfo_addnode`. However,\n-  it is recommended to instead use the `connection_type` field (it will return\n-  `manual` when addnode is true). (#19725)\n-\n-- The `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPC call will now fail with\n-  `Insufficient funds` when inputs are manually selected but are not enough to cover\n-  the outputs and fee. Additional inputs can automatically be added through the\n-  new `add_inputs` option. (#16377)\n-\n-- The `fundrawtransaction` RPC now supports `add_inputs` option that when `false`\n-  prevents adding more inputs if necessary and consequently the RPC fails.\n-\n-Changes to Wallet or GUI related RPCs can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\n-\n-New RPCs\n---------\n-\n-- The `getindexinfo` RPC returns the actively running indices of the node,\n-  including their current sync status and height. It also accepts an `index_name`\n-  to specify returning only the status of that index. (#19550)\n-\n-Build System\n-------------\n-\n-Updated settings\n-----------------\n-\n-- The same ZeroMQ notification (e.g. `-zmqpubhashtx=address`) can now be\n-  specified multiple times to publish the same notification to different ZeroMQ\n-  sockets. (#18309)\n-\n-- The `-banscore` configuration option, which modified the default threshold for\n-  disconnecting and discouraging misbehaving peers, has been removed as part of\n-  changes in 0.20.1 and in this release to the handling of misbehaving peers.\n-  Refer to \"Changes regarding misbehaving peers\" in the 0.20.1 release notes for\n-  details. (#19464)\n-\n-- The `-debug=db` logging category, which was deprecated in 0.20 and replaced by\n-  `-debug=walletdb` to distinguish it from `coindb`, has been removed. (#19202)\n-\n-- A `download` permission has been extracted from the `noban` permission. For\n-  compatibility, `noban` implies the `download` permission, but this may change\n-  in future releases. Refer to the help of the affected settings `-whitebind`\n-  and `-whitelist` for more details. (#19191)\n-\n-- Netmasks that contain 1-bits after 0-bits (the 1-bits are not contiguous on\n-  the left side, e.g. 255.0.255.255) are no longer accepted. They are invalid\n-  according to RFC 4632. Netmasks are used in the `-rpcallowip` and `-whitelist`\n-  configuration options and in the `setban` RPC. (#19628)\n-\n-Changes to Wallet or GUI related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet  section below.\n-\n-Tools and Utilities\n--------------------\n-\n-- The `connections` field of `bitcoin-cli -getinfo` is expanded to return a JSON\n-  object with `in`, `out` and `total` numbers of peer connections. It previously\n-  returned a single integer value for the total number of peer connections. (#19405)\n-\n-- A new `bitcoin-cli -generate` command, equivalent to RPC `generatenewaddress`\n-  followed by `generatetoaddress`, can generate blocks for command line testing\n-  purposes. This is a client-side version of the\n-  former `generate` RPC. See the help for details. (#19133)\n-\n-- The `bitcoin-cli -getinfo` command now displays the wallet name and balance for\n-  each of the loaded wallets when more than one is loaded (e.g. in multiwallet\n-  mode) and a wallet is not specified with `-rpcwallet`. (#18594)\n-\n-New settings\n-------------\n-\n-- The `startupnotify` option is used to specify a command to\n-  execute when Bitcoin Core has finished with its startup\n-  sequence. (#15367)\n-\n-Wallet\n-------\n-\n-- Backwards compatibility has been dropped for two `getaddressinfo` RPC\n-  deprecations, as notified in the 0.20 release notes. The deprecated `label`\n-  field has been removed as well as the deprecated `labels` behavior of\n-  returning a JSON object containing `name` and `purpose` key-value pairs. Since\n-  0.20, the `labels` field returns a JSON array of label names. (#19200)\n-\n-- To improve wallet privacy, the frequency of wallet rebroadcast attempts is\n-  reduced from approximately once every 15 minutes to once every 12-36 hours.\n-  To maintain a similar level of guarantee for initial broadcast of wallet\n-  transactions, the mempool tracks these transactions as a part of the newly\n-  introduced unbroadcast set. See the \"P2P and network changes\" section for\n-  more information on the unbroadcast set. (#18038)\n-\n-- The `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` RPCs accept an optional `verbose=True`\n-  argument to also return the fee reason about the sent tx. (#19501)\n-\n-- The wallet can create a transaction without change even when the keypool is\n-  empty. Previously it failed. (#17219)\n-\n-- The `-salvagewallet` startup option has been removed. A new `salvage` command\n-  has been added to the `bitcoin-wallet` tool which performs the salvage\n-  operations that `-salvagewallet` did. (#18918)\n-\n-- A new configuration flag `-maxapsfee` has been added, which sets the max\n-  allowed avoid partial spends (APS) fee. It defaults to 0 (i.e. fee is the\n-  same with and without APS). Setting it to -1 will disable APS, unless\n-  `-avoidpartialspends` is set. (#14582)\n-\n-- The wallet will now avoid partial spends (APS) by default, if this does not\n-  result in a difference in fees compared to the non-APS variant. The allowed\n-  fee threshold can be adjusted using the new `-maxapsfee` configuration\n-  option. (#14582)\n-\n-- The `createwallet`, `loadwallet`, and `unloadwallet` RPCs now accept\n-  `load_on_startup` options to modify the settings list. Unless these options\n-  are explicitly set to true or false, the list is not modified, so the RPC\n-  methods remain backwards compatible. (#15937)\n-\n-- A new `send` RPC with similar syntax to `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, including\n-  support for coin selection and a custom fee rate. The `send` RPC is\n-  experimental and may change in subsequent releases. Using it is encouraged\n-  once it's no longer experimental: `sendmany` and `sendtoaddress` may be\n-  deprecated in a future release. (#16378)\n-\n-- `fundrawtransaction` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` when used with the\n-  `lockUnspents` argument now lock manually selected coins, in addition to\n-  automatically selected coins. Note that locked coins are never used in\n-  automatic coin selection, but can still be manually selected. (#18244)\n-\n-- The `-zapwallettxes` startup option has been removed and its functionality\n-  removed from the wallet.  This option was originally intended to allow for\n-  the fee bumping of transactions that did not signal RBF. This functionality\n-  has been superseded with the abandon transaction feature. (#19671)\n-\n-- The error code when no wallet is loaded, but a wallet RPC is called, has been\n-  changed from `-32601` (method not found) to `-18` (wallet not found).\n-  (#20101)\n-\n-### Automatic wallet creation removed\n-\n-Bitcoin Core will no longer automatically create new wallets on startup. It will\n-load existing wallets specified by `-wallet` options on the command line or in\n-`bitcoin.conf` or `settings.json` files. And by default it will also load a\n-top-level unnamed (\"\") wallet. However, if specified wallets don't exist,\n-Bitcoin Core will now just log warnings instead of creating new wallets with\n-new keys and addresses like previous releases did.\n-\n-New wallets can be created through the GUI (which has a more prominent create\n-wallet option), through the `bitcoin-cli createwallet` or `bitcoin-wallet\n-create` commands, or the `createwallet` RPC. (#15454)\n-\n-### Experimental Descriptor Wallets\n-\n-Please note that Descriptor Wallets are still experimental and not all expected functionality\n-is available. Additionally there may be some bugs and current functions may change in the future.\n-Bugs and missing functionality can be reported to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues).\n-\n-0.21 introduces a new type of wallet - Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets store\n-scriptPubKey information using descriptors. This is in contrast to the Legacy Wallet\n-structure where keys are used to generate scriptPubKeys and addresses. Because of this\n-shift to being script based instead of key based, many of the confusing things that Legacy\n-Wallets do are not possible with Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets use a definition\n-of \"mine\" for scripts which is simpler and more intuitive than that used by Legacy Wallets.\n-Descriptor Wallets also uses different semantics for watch-only things and imports.\n-\n-As Descriptor Wallets are a new type of wallet, their introduction does not affect existing wallets.\n-Users who already have a Bitcoin Core wallet can continue to use it as they did before without\n-any change in behavior. Newly created Legacy Wallets (which is the default type of wallet) will\n-behave as they did in previous versions of Bitcoin Core.\n-\n-The differences between Descriptor Wallets and Legacy Wallets are largely limited to non user facing\n-things. They are intended to behave similarly except for the import/export and watchonly functionality\n-as described below.\n-\n-#### Creating Descriptor Wallets\n-\n-Descriptor Wallets are not created by default. They must be explicitly created using the\n-`createwallet` RPC or via the GUI. A `descriptors` option has been added to `createwallet`.\n-Setting `descriptors` to `true` will create a Descriptor Wallet instead of a Legacy Wallet.\n-\n-In the GUI, a checkbox has been added to the Create Wallet Dialog to indicate that a\n-Descriptor Wallet should be created.\n-\n-Without those options being set, a Legacy Wallet will be created instead. Additionally the\n-Default Wallet created upon first startup of Bitcoin Core will be a Legacy Wallet.\n-\n-#### `IsMine` Semantics\n-\n-`IsMine` refers to the function used to determine whether a script belongs to the wallet.\n-This is used to determine whether an output belongs to the wallet. `IsMine` in Legacy Wallets\n-returns true if the wallet would be able to sign an input that spends an output with that script.\n-Since keys can be involved in a variety of different scripts, this definition for `IsMine` can\n-lead to many unexpected scripts being considered part of the wallet.\n-\n-With Descriptor Wallets, descriptors explicitly specify the set of scripts that are owned by\n-the wallet. Since descriptors are deterministic and easily enumerable, users will know exactly\n-what scripts the wallet will consider to belong to it. Additionally the implementation of `IsMine`\n-in Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets. Notably, in Legacy Wallets, `IsMine`\n-allowed for users to take one type of address (e.g. P2PKH), mutate it into another address type\n-(e.g. P2WPKH), and the wallet would still detect outputs sending to the new address type\n-even without that address being requested from the wallet. Descriptor Wallets does not\n-allow for this and will only watch for the addresses that were explicitly requested from the wallet.\n-\n-These changes to `IsMine` will make it easier to reason about what scripts the wallet will\n-actually be watching for in outputs. However for the vast majority of users, this change is\n-largely transparent and will not have noticeable effect.\n-\n-#### Imports and Exports\n-\n-In Legacy Wallets, raw scripts and keys could be imported to the wallet. Those imported scripts\n-and keys are treated separately from the keys generated by the wallet. This complicates the `IsMine`\n-logic as it has to distinguish between spendable and watchonly.\n-\n-Descriptor Wallets handle importing scripts and keys differently. Only complete descriptors can be\n-imported. These descriptors are then added to the wallet as if it were a descriptor generated by\n-the wallet itself. This simplifies the `IsMine` logic so that it no longer has to distinguish\n-between spendable and watchonly. As such, the watchonly model for Descriptor Wallets is also\n-different and described in more detail in the next section.\n-\n-To import into a Descriptor Wallet, a new `importdescriptors` RPC has been added that uses a syntax\n-similar to that of `importmulti`.\n-\n-As Legacy Wallets and Descriptor Wallets use different mechanisms for storing and importing scripts and keys\n-the existing import RPCs have been disabled for descriptor wallets.\n-New export RPCs for Descriptor Wallets have not yet been added.\n-\n-The following RPCs are disabled for Descriptor Wallets:\n-\n-* importprivkey\n-* importpubkey\n-* importaddress\n-* importwallet\n-* dumpprivkey\n-* dumpwallet\n-* importmulti\n-* addmultisigaddress\n-* sethdseed\n-\n-#### Watchonly Wallets\n-\n-A Legacy Wallet contains both private keys and scripts that were being watched.\n-Those watched scripts would not contribute to your normal balance. In order to see the watchonly\n-balance and to use watchonly things in transactions, an `include_watchonly` option was added\n-to many RPCs that would allow users to do that. However it is easy to forget to include this option.\n-\n-Descriptor Wallets move to a per-wallet watchonly model. Instead an entire wallet is considered to be\n-watchonly depending on whether it was created with private keys disabled. This eliminates the need\n-to distinguish between things that are watchonly and things that are not within a wallet itself.\n-\n-This change does have a caveat. If a Descriptor Wallet with private keys *enabled* has\n-a multiple key descriptor without all of the private keys (e.g. `multi(...)` with only one private key),\n-then the wallet will fail to sign and broadcast transactions. Such wallets would need to use the PSBT\n-workflow but the typical GUI Send, `sendtoaddress`, etc. workflows would still be available, just\n-non-functional.\n-\n-This issue is worsened if the wallet contains both single key (e.g. `wpkh(...)`) descriptors and such\n-multiple key descriptors as some transactions could be signed and broadast and others not. This is\n-due to some transactions containing only single key inputs, while others would contain both single\n-key and multiple key inputs, depending on which are available and how the coin selection algorithm\n-selects inputs. However this is not considered to be a supported use case; multisigs\n-should be in their own wallets which do not already have descriptors. Although users cannot export\n-descriptors with private keys for now as explained earlier.\n-\n-#### BIP 44/49/84 Support\n-\n-The change to using descriptors changes the default derivation paths used by Bitcoin Core\n-to adhere to BIP 44/49/84. Descriptors with different derivation paths can be imported without\n-issue.\n-\n-### Wallet RPC changes\n-\n-- The `upgradewallet` RPC replaces the `-upgradewallet` command line option.\n-  (#15761)\n-- The `settxfee` RPC will fail if the fee was set higher than the `-maxtxfee`\n-  command line setting. The wallet will already fail to create transactions\n-  with fees higher than `-maxtxfee`. (#18467)\n-\n-GUI changes\n------------\n-\n-- Wallets created or loaded in the GUI will now be automatically loaded on\n-  startup, so they don't need to be manually reloaded next time Bitcoin Core is\n-  started. The list of wallets to load on startup is stored in\n-  `\\<datadir\\>/settings.json` and augments any command line or `bitcoin.conf`\n-  `-wallet=` settings that specify more wallets to load. Wallets that are\n-  unloaded in the GUI get removed from the settings list so they won't load\n-  again automatically next startup. (#19754)\n-\n-- The GUI Peers window no longer displays a \"Ban Score\" field. This is part of\n-  changes in 0.20.1 and in this release to the handling of misbehaving\n-  peers. Refer to \"Changes regarding misbehaving peers\" in the 0.20.1 release\n-  notes for details. (#19512)\n-\n-Low-level changes\n-=================",

Those old versions, in the event of a downgrade, will log an error\n-message \"Incorrect keysize in addrman deserialization\" and will continue normal\n-operation as if the file was missing, creating a new empty one. (#19954)\n-\n Notable changes\n ===============\n \n-P2P and network changes\n------------------------\n-\n-- The mempool now tracks whether transactions submitted via the wallet or RPCs\n-  have been successfully broadcast. Every 10-15 minutes, the node will try to\n-  announce unbroadcast transactions until a peer requests it via a `getdata`\n-  message or the transaction is removed from the mempool for other reasons.\n-  The node will not track the broadcast status of transactions submitted to the\n-  node using P2P relay. This version reduces the initial broadcast guarantees\n-  for wallet transactions submitted via P2P to a node running the wallet. (#18038)\n-\n-- The size of the set of transactions that peers have announced and we consider\n-  for requests has been reduced from 100000 to 5000 (per peer), and further\n-  announcements will be ignored when that limit is reached. If you need to dump\n-  (very) large batches of transactions, exceptions can be made for trusted\n-  peers using the \"relay\" network permission. For localhost for example it can\n-  be enabled using the command line option `-whitelist=relay@127.0.0.1`.\n-  (#19988)\n-\n-- The Tor onion service that is automatically created by setting the\n-  `-listenonion` configuration parameter will now be created as a Tor v3 service\n-  instead of Tor v2. The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be\n-  left untouched in the `onion_private_key` file in the data directory (see\n-  `-datadir`) and can be removed if not needed. Bitcoin Core will no longer\n-  attempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a\n-  file named `onion_v3_private_key`. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not\n-  recommended), then `onion_private_key` can be copied over\n-  `onion_v3_private_key`, e.g.\n-  `cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key`. (#19954)\n-\n-Updated RPCs\n-------------\n-\n-- The `getpeerinfo` RPC now has additional `last_block` and `last_transaction`\n-  fields that return the UNIX epoch time of the last block and the last valid\n-  transaction received from each peer. (#19731)\n-\n-- `getnetworkinfo` now returns two new fields, `connections_in` and\n-  `connections_out`, that provide the number of inbound and outbound peer\n-  connections. These new fields are in addition to the existing `connections`\n-  field, which returns the total number of peer connections. (#19405)\n-\n-- Exposed transaction version numbers are now treated as unsigned 32-bit\n-  integers instead of signed 32-bit integers. This matches their treatment in\n-  consensus logic. Versions greater than 2 continue to be non-standard\n-  (matching previous behavior of smaller than 1 or greater than 2 being\n-  non-standard). Note that this includes the joinpsbt command, which combines\n-  partially-signed transactions by selecting the highest version number.\n-  (#16525)\n-\n-- `getmempoolinfo` now returns an additional `unbroadcastcount` field. The\n-  mempool tracks locally submitted transactions until their initial broadcast\n-  is acknowledged by a peer. This field returns the count of transactions\n-  waiting for acknowledgement.\n-\n-- Mempool RPCs such as `getmempoolentry` and `getrawmempool` with\n-  `verbose=true` now return an additional `unbroadcast` field. This indicates\n-  whether initial broadcast of the transaction has been acknowledged by a\n-  peer. `getmempoolancestors` and `getmempooldescendants` are also updated.\n-\n-- The `bumpfee`, `fundrawtransaction`, `sendmany`, `sendtoaddress`, and `walletcreatefundedpsbt`\n-RPC commands have been updated to include two new fee estimation methods \"BTC/kB\" and \"sat/B\".\n-The target is the fee expressed explicitly in the given form. Note that use of this feature\n-will trigger BIP 125 (replace-by-fee) opt-in. (#11413)\n-\n-- In addition, the `estimate_mode` parameter is now case insensitive for all of\n-  the above RPC commands. (#11413)\n-\n-- The `bumpfee` command now uses `conf_target` rather than `confTarget` in the\n-  options. (#11413)\n-\n-- The `getpeerinfo` RPC no longer returns the `banscore` field unless the configuration\n-  option `-deprecatedrpc=banscore` is used. The `banscore` field will be fully\n-  removed in the next major release. (#19469)\n-\n-- The `testmempoolaccept` RPC returns `vsize` and a `fees` object with the `base` fee\n-  if the transaction would pass validation. (#19940)\n-\n-- The `getpeerinfo` RPC now returns a `connection_type` field. This indicates\n-  the type of connection established with the peer. It will return one of six\n-  options. For more information, see the `getpeerinfo` help documentation.\n-  (#19725)\n-\n-- The `getpeerinfo` RPC no longer returns the `addnode` field by default. This\n-  field will be fully removed in the next major release.  It can be accessed\n-  with the configuration option `-deprecatedrpc=getpeerinfo_addnode`. However,\n-  it is recommended to instead use the `connection_type` field (it will return\n-  `manual` when addnode is true). (#19725)\n-\n-- The `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPC call will now fail with\n-  `Insufficient funds` when inputs are manually selected but are not enough to cover\n-  the outputs and fee. Additional inputs can automatically be added through the\n-  new `add_inputs` option. (#16377)\n-\n-- The `fundrawtransaction` RPC now supports `add_inputs` option that when `false`\n-  prevents adding more inputs if necessary and consequently the RPC fails.\n-\n-Changes to Wallet or GUI related RPCs can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.",

Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\n when macOS \"dark mode\" is activated.\n \n-The node's known peers are persisted to disk in a file called `peers.dat`. The\n-format of this file has been changed in a backwards-incompatible way in order to\n-accommodate the storage of Tor v3 and other BIP155 addresses. This means that if\n-the file is modified by 0.21.0 or newer then older versions will not be able to\n-read it. Those old versions, in the event of a downgrade, will log an error\n-message \"Incorrect keysize in addrman deserialization\" and will continue normal\n-operation as if the file was missing, creating a new empty one. (#19954)\n-\n Notable changes\n ===============\n \n-P2P and network changes\n------------------------\n-\n-- The mempool now tracks whether transactions submitted via the wallet or RPCs\n-  have been successfully broadcast. Every 10-15 minutes, the node will try to\n-  announce unbroadcast transactions until a peer requests it via a `getdata`\n-  message or the transaction is removed from the mempool for other reasons.\n-  The node will not track the broadcast status of transactions submitted to the\n-  node using P2P relay. This version reduces the initial broadcast guarantees\n-  for wallet transactions submitted via P2P to a node running the wallet. (#18038)\n-\n-- The size of the set of transactions that peers have announced and we consider\n-  for requests has been reduced from 100000 to 5000 (per peer), and further\n-  announcements will be ignored when that limit is reached. If you need to dump\n-  (very) large batches of transactions, exceptions can be made for trusted\n-  peers using the \"relay\" network permission. For localhost for example it can\n-  be enabled using the command line option `-whitelist=relay@127.0.0.1`.\n-  (#19988)\n-\n-- The Tor onion service that is automatically created by setting the\n-  `-listenonion` configuration parameter will now be created as a Tor v3 service\n-  instead of Tor v2. The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be\n-  left untouched in the `onion_private_key` file in the data directory (see\n-  `-datadir`) and can be removed if not needed. Bitcoin Core will no longer\n-  attempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a\n-  file named `onion_v3_private_key`. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not\n-  recommended), then `onion_private_key` can be copied over\n-  `onion_v3_private_key`, e.g.\n-  `cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key`. (#19954)\n-\n-Updated RPCs\n-------------\n-\n-- The `getpeerinfo` RPC now has additional `last_block` and `last_transaction`\n-  fields that return the UNIX epoch time of the last block and the last valid\n-  transaction received from each peer. (#19731)\n-\n-- `getnetworkinfo` now returns two new fields, `connections_in` and\n-  `connections_out`, that provide the number of inbound and outbound peer\n-  connections. These new fields are in addition to the existing `connections`\n-  field, which returns the total number of peer connections. (#19405)\n-\n-- Exposed transaction version numbers are now treated as unsigned 32-bit\n-  integers instead of signed 32-bit integers. This matches their treatment in\n-  consensus logic. Versions greater than 2 continue to be non-standard\n-  (matching previous behavior of smaller than 1 or greater than 2 being\n-  non-standard). Note that this includes the joinpsbt command, which combines\n-  partially-signed transactions by selecting the highest version number.\n-  (#16525)\n-\n-- `getmempoolinfo` now returns an additional `unbroadcastcount` field. The\n-  mempool tracks locally submitted transactions until their initial broadcast\n-  is acknowledged by a peer. This field returns the count of transactions\n-  waiting for acknowledgement.\n-\n-- Mempool RPCs such as `getmempoolentry` and `getrawmempool` with\n-  `verbose=true` now return an additional `unbroadcast` field. This indicates\n-  whether initial broadcast of the transaction has been acknowledged by a\n-  peer. `getmempoolancestors` and `getmempooldescendants` are also updated.\n-\n-- The `bumpfee`, `fundrawtransaction`, `sendmany`, `sendtoaddress`, and `walletcreatefundedpsbt`\n-RPC commands have been updated to include two new fee estimation methods \"BTC/kB\" and \"sat/B\".\n-The target is the fee expressed explicitly in the given form.

(#19200)\n-\n-- To improve wallet privacy, the frequency of wallet rebroadcast attempts is\n-  reduced from approximately once every 15 minutes to once every 12-36 hours.\n-  To maintain a similar level of guarantee for initial broadcast of wallet\n-  transactions, the mempool tracks these transactions as a part of the newly\n-  introduced unbroadcast set. See the \"P2P and network changes\" section for\n-  more information on the unbroadcast set. (#18038)\n-\n-- The `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` RPCs accept an optional `verbose=True`\n-  argument to also return the fee reason about the sent tx. (#19501)\n-\n-- The wallet can create a transaction without change even when the keypool is\n-  empty. Previously it failed. (#17219)\n-\n-- The `-salvagewallet` startup option has been removed. A new `salvage` command\n-  has been added to the `bitcoin-wallet` tool which performs the salvage\n-  operations that `-salvagewallet` did. (#18918)\n-\n-- A new configuration flag `-maxapsfee` has been added, which sets the max\n-  allowed avoid partial spends (APS) fee. It defaults to 0 (i.e. fee is the\n-  same with and without APS). Setting it to -1 will disable APS, unless\n-  `-avoidpartialspends` is set. (#14582)\n-\n-- The wallet will now avoid partial spends (APS) by default, if this does not\n-  result in a difference in fees compared to the non-APS variant. The allowed\n-  fee threshold can be adjusted using the new `-maxapsfee` configuration\n-  option. (#14582)\n-\n-- The `createwallet`, `loadwallet`, and `unloadwallet` RPCs now accept\n-  `load_on_startup` options to modify the settings list. Unless these options\n-  are explicitly set to true or false, the list is not modified, so the RPC\n-  methods remain backwards compatible. (#15937)\n-\n-- A new `send` RPC with similar syntax to `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, including\n-  support for coin selection and a custom fee rate. The `send` RPC is\n-  experimental and may change in subsequent releases. Using it is encouraged\n-  once it's no longer experimental: `sendmany` and `sendtoaddress` may be\n-  deprecated in a future release. (#16378)\n-\n-- `fundrawtransaction` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` when used with the\n-  `lockUnspents` argument now lock manually selected coins, in addition to\n-  automatically selected coins. Note that locked coins are never used in\n-  automatic coin selection, but can still be manually selected. (#18244)\n-\n-- The `-zapwallettxes` startup option has been removed and its functionality\n-  removed from the wallet.  This option was originally intended to allow for\n-  the fee bumping of transactions that did not signal RBF. This functionality\n-  has been superseded with the abandon transaction feature. (#19671)\n-\n-- The error code when no wallet is loaded, but a wallet RPC is called, has been\n-  changed from `-32601` (method not found) to `-18` (wallet not found).\n-  (#20101)\n-\n-### Automatic wallet creation removed\n-\n-Bitcoin Core will no longer automatically create new wallets on startup. It will\n-load existing wallets specified by `-wallet` options on the command line or in\n-`bitcoin.conf` or `settings.json` files. And by default it will also load a\n-top-level unnamed (\"\") wallet. However, if specified wallets don't exist,\n-Bitcoin Core will now just log warnings instead of creating new wallets with\n-new keys and addresses like previous releases did.\n-\n-New wallets can be created through the GUI (which has a more prominent create\n-wallet option), through the `bitcoin-cli createwallet` or `bitcoin-wallet\n-create` commands, or the `createwallet` RPC. (#15454)\n-\n-### Experimental Descriptor Wallets\n-\n-Please note that Descriptor Wallets are still experimental and not all expected functionality\n-is available. Additionally there may be some bugs and current functions may change in the future.\n-Bugs and missing functionality can be reported to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues).\n-\n-0.21 introduces a new type of wallet - Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets store\n-scriptPubKey information using descriptors. This is in contrast to the Legacy Wallet\n-structure where keys are used to generate scriptPubKeys and addresses. Because of this\n-shift to being script based instead of key based, many of the confusing things that Legacy\n-Wallets do are not possible with Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets use a definition\n-of \"mine\" for scripts which is simpler and more intuitive than that used by Legacy Wallets.\n-Descriptor Wallets also uses different semantics for watch-only things and imports.\n-\n-As Descriptor Wallets are a new type of wallet, their introduction does not affect existing wallets.\n-Users who already have a Bitcoin Core wallet can continue to use it as they did before without\n-any change in behavior. Newly created Legacy Wallets (which is the default type of wallet) will\n-behave as they did in previous versions of Bitcoin Core.\n-\n-The differences between Descriptor Wallets and Legacy Wallets are largely limited to non user facing\n-things. They are intended to behave similarly except for the import/export and watchonly functionality\n-as described below.\n-\n-#### Creating Descriptor Wallets\n-\n-Descriptor Wallets are not created by default. They must be explicitly created using the\n-`createwallet` RPC or via the GUI. A `descriptors` option has been added to `createwallet`.\n-Setting `descriptors` to `true` will create a Descriptor Wallet instead of a Legacy Wallet.\n-\n-In the GUI, a checkbox has been added to the Create Wallet Dialog to indicate that a\n-Descriptor Wallet should be created.\n-\n-Without those options being set, a Legacy Wallet will be created instead. Additionally the\n-Default Wallet created upon first startup of Bitcoin Core will be a Legacy Wallet.\n-\n-#### `IsMine` Semantics\n-\n-`IsMine` refers to the function used to determine whether a script belongs to the wallet.\n-This is used to determine whether an output belongs to the wallet. `IsMine` in Legacy Wallets\n-returns true if the wallet would be able to sign an input that spends an output with that script.\n-Since keys can be involved in a variety of different scripts, this definition for `IsMine` can\n-lead to many unexpected scripts being considered part of the wallet.\n-\n-With Descriptor Wallets, descriptors explicitly specify the set of scripts that are owned by\n-the wallet. Since descriptors are deterministic and easily enumerable, users will know exactly\n-what scripts the wallet will consider to belong to it. Additionally the implementation of `IsMine`\n-in Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets. Notably, in Legacy Wallets, `IsMine`\n-allowed for users to take one type of address (e.g. P2PKH), mutate it into another address type\n-(e.g. P2WPKH), and the wallet would still detect outputs sending to the new address type\n-even without that address being requested from the wallet. Descriptor Wallets does not\n-allow for this and will only watch for the addresses that were explicitly requested from the wallet.\n-\n-These changes to `IsMine` will make it easier to reason about what scripts the wallet will\n-actually be watching for in outputs. However for the vast majority of users, this change is\n-largely transparent and will not have noticeable effect.\n-\n-#### Imports and Exports\n-\n-In Legacy Wallets, raw scripts and keys could be imported to the wallet. Those imported scripts\n-and keys are treated separately from the keys generated by the wallet. This complicates the `IsMine`\n-logic as it has to distinguish between spendable and watchonly.\n-\n-Descriptor Wallets handle importing scripts and keys differently. Only complete descriptors can be\n-imported. These descriptors are then added to the wallet as if it were a descriptor generated by\n-the wallet itself. This simplifies the `IsMine` logic so that it no longer has to distinguish\n-between spendable and watchonly. As such, the watchonly model for Descriptor Wallets is also\n-different and described in more detail in the next section.\n-\n-To import into a Descriptor Wallet, a new `importdescriptors` RPC has been added that uses a syntax\n-similar to that of `importmulti`.\n-\n-As Legacy Wallets and Descriptor Wallets use different mechanisms for storing and importing scripts and keys\n-the existing import RPCs have been disabled for descriptor wallets.\n-New export RPCs for Descriptor Wallets have not yet been added.\n-\n-The following RPCs are disabled for Descriptor Wallets:\n-\n-* importprivkey\n-* importpubkey\n-* importaddress\n-* importwallet\n-* dumpprivkey\n-* dumpwallet\n-* importmulti\n-* addmultisigaddress\n-* sethdseed\n-\n-#### Watchonly Wallets\n-\n-A Legacy Wallet contains both private keys and scripts that were being watched.\n-Those watched scripts would not contribute to your normal balance. In order to see the watchonly\n-balance and to use watchonly things in transactions, an `include_watchonly` option was added\n-to many RPCs that would allow users to do that. However it is easy to forget to include this option.\n-\n-Descriptor Wallets move to a per-wallet watchonly model. Instead an entire wallet is considered to be\n-watchonly depending on whether it was created with private keys disabled. This eliminates the need\n-to distinguish between things that are watchonly and things that are not within a wallet itself.\n-\n-This change does have a caveat. If a Descriptor Wallet with private keys *enabled* has\n-a multiple key descriptor without all of the private keys (e.g. `multi(...)` with only one private key),\n-then the wallet will fail to sign and broadcast transactions. Such wallets would need to use the PSBT\n-workflow but the typical GUI Send, `sendtoaddress`, etc. workflows would still be available, just\n-non-functional.\n-\n-This issue is worsened if the wallet contains both single key (e.g. `wpkh(...)`) descriptors and such\n-multiple key descriptors as some transactions could be signed and broadast and others not. This is\n-due to some transactions containing only single key inputs, while others would contain both single\n-key and multiple key inputs, depending on which are available and how the coin selection algorithm\n-selects inputs. However this is not considered to be a supported use case; multisigs\n-should be in their own wallets which do not already have descriptors. Although users cannot export\n-descriptors with private keys for now as explained earlier.\n-\n-#### BIP 44/49/84 Support\n-\n-The change to using descriptors changes the default derivation paths used by Bitcoin Core\n-to adhere to BIP 44/49/84. Descriptors with different derivation paths can be imported without\n-issue.\n-\n-### Wallet RPC changes\n-\n-- The `upgradewallet` RPC replaces the `-upgradewallet` command line option.\n-  (#15761)\n-- The `settxfee` RPC will fail if the fee was set higher than the `-maxtxfee`\n-  command line setting. The wallet will already fail to create transactions\n-  with fees higher than `-maxtxfee`. (#18467)\n-\n-GUI changes\n------------\n-\n-- Wallets created or loaded in the GUI will now be automatically loaded on\n-  startup, so they don't need to be manually reloaded next time Bitcoin Core is\n-  started. The list of wallets to load on startup is stored in\n-  `\\<datadir\\>/settings.json` and augments any command line or `bitcoin.conf`\n-  `-wallet=` settings that specify more wallets to load. Wallets that are\n-  unloaded in the GUI get removed from the settings list so they won't load\n-  again automatically next startup. (#19754)\n-\n-- The GUI Peers window no longer displays a \"Ban Score\" field. This is part of\n-  changes in 0.20.1 and in this release to the handling of misbehaving\n-  peers. Refer to \"Changes regarding misbehaving peers\" in the 0.20.1 release\n-  notes for details. (#19512)\n-\n-Low-level changes\n-=================",
