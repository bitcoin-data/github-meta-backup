      "body": "@luke-jr In this specific case the alternative and the current situation is that a human reviewer with probability ~100 % will point out that the PR author forgot to add the `explicit` specifier. The PR author will then add it with probability ~100 % before PR merge since `explicit` is the reasonable post-C++11 default which we explicitly recommend in the developer notes:\r\n\r\n> **By default, declare single-argument constructors explicit.**\r\n> \r\n> Rationale: This is a precaution to avoid unintended conversions that might arise when single-argument constructors are used as implicit conversion functions.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most common review comments in my experience. IMO it is better to have it automatically and mechanically fixed by the PR author before human review takes place to minimise the time spent by human reviewers on dull \"mechanical review work\".\r\n\r\nRationale directly from the Bible's Old Testament^W^W^WC++ Core Guidelines with editors Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter:\r\n\r\n> **[C.46](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c46-by-default-declare-single-argument-constructors-explicit): By default, declare single-argument constructors explicit**\r\n> …\r\n> **Reason:** To avoid unintended conversions.\r\n> …\r\n> **Enforcement:** (Simple) Single-argument constructors should be declared explicit. Good single argument non-explicit constructors are rare in most code based. Warn for all that are not on a “positive list”.\r\n\r\n:-)",
