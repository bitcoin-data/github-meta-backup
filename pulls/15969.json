    "body": "This is an experimental refactor I wrote to help myself understand script validation logic better. I'm not strongly advocating for it as it touches consensus and I haven't thoroughly verified it is identical, but I felt it was much clearer than the existing logic, so was worth sharing.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the current VerifyScript logic processes all scripts down the same control flow path. This makes the code a bit hard to reason about as the logic for enabling features (e.g., segwit, p2sh, p2sh segwit) is all interleaved cleverly. Furthermore, the use of the stack between execution to communicate conditions for checks (e.g., clearstack) is confusing. In order for me to understand what it was doing and be convinced it is correct, I felt I should re-write it to be less clever in several small steps. This PR is the result of de-clevering this code.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I:\r\n1) duplicate the entire verification logic for the main Script templates we know about.\r\n2) Simplify the logic substantially for several types of script.\r\n3) Get rid of swapping the stack copy and just running p2sh on a copy of the stack\r\n4) Because we know the exact side effects of a SegWit program, we are able to avoid executing the segwit script at all and directly run the segwit program. (We could do the same trick for P2SH, but it is a bigger refactor).\r\n5) Moved assertions about flag combinations to be unconditional\r\n6) Made a few checks into asserts where we know (based on script type) it will never fail\r\n\r\nThe code could be further simplified with a bit more duplication (currently the classic script verification code is used in multiple modes), but at current I think it is a nice balance between repetition and clarity.\r\n\r\nIn the future if new flags are introduced, they should hopefully only be affecting witness programs and not scripts. If this logic needed to be amended, it should be (IMO) easier to patch this version of the function than the current one.\r\n\r\nI haven't benchmarked, but skipping a few extra EvaluateScripts for segwit probably doesn't hurt.\r\n\r\nThe Diff for this PR kinda sucks, I recommend just looking at the files side-by-side.",

Can you explain what your motivation is for opening this? What are you expecting from other contributors?\r\n\r\nA good general principal is that we shouldn't change consensus code unless there are very obvious benefits, and if we do have to make changes, the review bar should be very high indeed. This PR clearly doesn't offer those benefits or meet that bar. Much of the feedback in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14837 also applies here.\r\n\r\nConcept NACK",

      "body": "Well, the idea is that I wanted to understand how this part of the code was working and it was needlessly more complicated than it should be.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand it better, I refactored it into something simpler. I opened the PR because if anyone in the future has an interest in looking at this logic, perhaps because they are adding a new script flag, I would point them towards perhaps doing this refactor first if the logic becomes especially complex. \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving a PR open means that if someone touches this function DrahBot will automatically warn the conflict, allowing a reviewer to check it out as well even if they don't search. \r\n\r\nAnother possible outcome from this would be to turn this version of the code into a comment, which details that the semantics of the following code should be equivalent to the comment flow.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of this, and a reason why you should spend your time to review it, is that it passes the test suite. If you think there is a risk that this code couldn't have identical semantics, you could write a test demonstrating that which would help protect us from errors made down the line when there are changes adding a feature rather than behavior less refactoring.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for benchmarking -- I don't necessarily suspect that the current version is slow, but perhaps now this gives me a reason to write a benchmark which can test master as well (I didn't write this one with performance in mind, just clarity). That benchmark can help prevent regression in the future. ",

There would obviously be tests to (aim to) verify correspondence between the two, but from an assurance perspective, we would not know for sure that they exhibit the same behavior in all cases. Bugs in the second would only affect its users, rather than risk forking the network however.\n\nThis is the sort of change that would make perfect second in (2), but not in (1).",

(I reproduced this from scratch, not a branch that existed prior). Each commit *should* be able to run and pass all tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n@sipa I agree that it would be good to produce an untouched version that stays the same for a very long time -- I suppose where we might differ in opinion is that I think that this might be a good candidate for that freeze/reference logic ahead of the fork to a more feature-ful version. I'm not what kind of features you mean though, given that they would probably impact consensus at the end of the day.",

      "body": "We don't disagree that the goal is consistency.\r\n\r\nMy view is that, as noted above, this version is superior in maintaining consistency with future versions/features added.\r\n\r\nI.e., if we add further complexity to this code for handling a new case or flag we will have an increased likelihood of those code paths causing an incompatibility if the flag is added against the old version than against a refactored version. E.g., if the current version is 0.20 and 0.21 makes a change that is incompatible with version 0.20 and earlier that is worse than a change which is compatible with 0.20 and incompatible with 0.19. I doubt that in the event of a catastrophic fork error anyone is going to take \"whatever Bitcoin 0.8 syncs to\" as the ground truth.\r\n\r\nWhat's further nice about this version is that because SegWit is pattern matched, an incompatible future change in script processing (or existing bug) has segwit's behavior isolated, reducing the surface of a change to EvalScript's logic having an impact on SegWit detection, even at the expense of consistency. I'd personally -- and I understand this may not be a consensus view -- rather have old nodes fork off if SegWit had some specification error in it which caused old interpreters to treat SegWit programs as invalid spends. I admit that's a cherry picked example -- it's entirely possible the new code would make something previously spendable unspendable.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm not strongly advocating that we need to change the code to be this way. But I think it might be worth it to do something like this in advance of further flags or complexities being added which bear an equal if not greater risk of breaking consensus.",
