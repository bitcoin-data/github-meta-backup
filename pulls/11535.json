      "body": "I don't have any authority here, I can only offer advice how I would approach this.\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean by \"this\"? I think the code should transition to using signed integers pervasively, everywhere by default, except the places where it needs unsigned integers (such as bit fiddling and modulo-2 arithmetic, a lot of crypto code falls into this category).\r\n\r\nI think getting there has to be incremental, and during the transition there will probably be a net increase of signed/unsigned casts. But in the end the whole codebase could be built with `-Wsign-conversion -Werror`, which would be a great place to be in, and with fewer casts.\r\n\r\n@practicalswift I believe you've found the issues you've addressed here with `-fsanitize=unsigned`, right? I think that's a good tool to find the most egregious misuses of unsigned integers, they should probably be the first ones to go. However, perhaps addressing all of these individual spots in a single commit isn't the right slicing or increment towards the goal of reducing misuses of unsigned integers. Perhaps instead, pick one, and fix that one properly, including all the ripple-effects it may have.\r\n\r\nfor example, take [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11535/files#diff-ca74c4b28865382863b8fe7633a85cd6R219) part of the patch.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would make more sense to explore what would happen if `GetTxSize()` would return an `int64_t` (which seems like a cleaner solution than casting its result like this).",
