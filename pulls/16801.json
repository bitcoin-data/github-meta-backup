    "body": "This is a custom allocator for node based containers, as described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16718#issuecomment-525878177. Hopefully, this is a less controversial change and easier to review than https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16718.\r\n\r\nThe allocator retains memory of nodes, and allocates them in bulk. In my benchmarks, using this pool allocator for `CCoinsMap` gives about 16% faster `-reindex-chainstate`, and decreases memory usage by ~8%. The allocator is potentially useful for all node-based containers like `std::list`, `std::map`, `std::unordered_map`, etc. I believe this is especially useful on systems where malloc() and free() are relatively expensive operations, since this allocator will dramatically reduce these calls.\r\n\r\nSome noteworthy properties about this allocator:\r\n\r\n* It relies on the fact that node based containers allocate nodes one at a time. If a container doesn't behave like this, the allocator will still work but won't be any faster.\r\n\r\n* The allocator determines the size of the nodes, which will then be used throughout the pool, by the first call to allocate(1). So if the container would not allocate something with the size of a node in its first call to allocate(1), the pool won't be usable for nodes since it was set up with a different size. With C++17 it would be possible to use a containers type `node_type` to correctly initialize the pool's size, but for now we have to rely on this heuristic.\r\n\r\n* Copying / moving / swapping a map propagates the allocator. So if two different pools are used for two containers a and b, calling `a = b` will from now on use b's pool in a.\r\n\r\n* The pool is not threadsafe. Two containers which use the same pool in different threads won't work.\r\n\r\n* A pool's memory is only actually destroyed in the pool's destructor.\r\n\r\nI've added a benchmark to compare std::map, std::unordered_map with and without the pool allocator for the `CCoinsMap`.

      "body": "After running benchmarks across a few different machines, I'm pretty confused.\r\n\r\nThe raw results are below, but the headline is that I'm consistently seeing branches using this allocator outperform master but also *vice versa* depending upon the host. It's about half and half, and when master wins it's by a pretty dramatic margin.\r\n\r\nE.g. master is reliably faster than this branch and #16718 on bench-ssd-2, bench-ssd-5, and bench-hdd-5 (except for one weird run where master took 41 hours??). On all other hosts (ssd-3, ssd-4, hdd-4), these branches beat master consistently.\r\n\r\nThis is very confusing to me because AFAICT -reindex-chainstate should be a deterministic process - i.e. I'd expect the same logical execution for a given height on mainnet regardless of host. I guess maybe blockfile layouts can differ, but would that really be responsible for so dramatic a difference?\r\n\r\nBefore anyone asks: these are dedicated benchmarking machines (specs listed below). Before each run I'm dropping all caches (`sudo /sbin/swapoff -a; sudo /sbin/sysctl vm.drop_caches=3;`), tuning with pyperf (`sudo /usr/local/bin/pyperf system tune;`), and I've ensured that the CPU governors are set to `performance`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nHostname:              bench-ssd-2\r\nKernel:                Linux 4.9.0-8-amd64\r\nOS:                    Debian GNU/Linux 9\r\nRAM (GB):

wondering if this allocator is behaving pathologically based upon some different initial condition across the hosts, but for now I'm pretty stumped. In the coming weeks I'll work on tooling that will allow me to get a more precise idea of where time is being spent and will roll all that into [bitcoinperf](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/bitcoinperf).",

It would be interesting to see where it's slowing down: e.g. if it's in the DB sync, or continuously, or right *before* a sync.\r\n\r\nI think since your host only has 7.7GB memory the slowdown might come from the host swapping. Maybe the problem is the way bitcoin is handling the cache: As transactions are added to the cache, it slowly gets full.\r\nWith some bad luck / bad configuration, the hashmap's load factor can get full close to the actual dbcache limit. If it has to double it's size right at that time, it will temporarily need a lot more memory than the dbcache, has to rehash, and once this costly operation is done, it will be over the dbcache limit, and the cache is dumped and thrown away. \r\n\r\nSo in that case it would be a much better logic to flush the cache once the load factor reaches maximum, and when another insert would bump it over the limit.",

      "body": "James walked me through the benchmarks, and I guess a summary is that the benchmarks do generally look good and show expected decreases in runtime and memory usage at varying dbcache sizes.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that in some benchmark setups, reindexing reliably but for no explicable reason takes a lot longer (9 hours vs 2 hours) on the bulk allocator and robinhood branches than it does on the master branch. That is, the robinhood and bulk allocator branches generally perform better in the ways we would expect, but on some particular benchmarking machines with particular datadirs, reindexing takes a *lot* longer when using bulk allocator and robinhood branches instead of the master branch.\r\n\r\nAlso, very strangely, copying the datadir from a benchmarking machine where reindexing with the bulk allocator branch was fast, to a benchmarking machine where reindexing with the bulk allocator branch was slow, somehow makes reindexing on that same machine fast as well. This is suspicious and probably indicates either a mistake made in benchmark setup, or the presence of a pre-existing pathological performance bug in bitcoin somehow triggered by changing the allocator. (But even that doesn't make much sense, because while it's possible to imagine the layout of block data in the datadir impacting reindex time, the actual block reads done during reindexing should be identical between the master and bulk allocator branches.)\r\n\r\nIt does seem like we need to debug the case where switching to the bulk allocator appears to cause reindexing slowdowns with particular datadirs, even though using the bulk allocator could only be causing these slowdowns very indirectly.",

      "body": "Okay, I'm back with good news and bad(ish) news. The good news is that the bench weirdness has been resolved by comparing master (6a7c40bee4, [`bench/master.1`](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/tree/bench/master.1)) to a version of this branch rebased on top of that same commit ([`bench/alloc.1`](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/tree/bench/alloc.1)). So I'm guessing the weirdness before may have been related to an assumevalid bump, but I'm not definitively sure.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that the now-very-consistent results don't show as much of an improvement as I expected. \r\n\r\nI did two separate runs over the course of a few days - for each machine, the branches were tested twice back-to-back in random order (results are ordered the same).

In fact I was a little surprised that an extra gig of dbcache doesn't seem to make any real difference in terms of runtime - if nothing else it marginally hurt the runtimes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo anyway, take this all for what it is. I wouldn't be surprised if after the wide variance seen in my benchmarking that this is all taken with a grain of salt, but I've done what I can to rule out spurious measures. That said, anyone should be able to reproduce these results by making superficial modifications to [this script](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/bitcoinperf/blob/master/bin/run_remote_reindex.py).\r\n\r\nI would say if these benchmarks are indeed characteristic of the performance gain associated with this PR, I am not in favor of merging it as such because I think the risk associated with swapping out an allocator isn't compensated for by a 3% reduction in IBD runtime. But that said I am (hopefully obviously) a big fan of this sort of work, and will continue to cheer @martinus on in his attempts to optimize what is certainly one of the biggest bottlenecks in bitcoind.",

Every release has a different assumed valid block set by default. So when looking at total IBD time, it makes sense to consider the setting where no validation happens because it is skipped by default. If there is a more than 10% speed-up, it should not be neglected.",

      "body": "@JeremyRubin that looks interesting. I think the `if (relatives.size() > full_size/2) return;` is a bit too aggressive though. For a hashmap uses doubling as resize strategy: if it has e.g. 256 elements and you add one it will double its size, and when you remove one element again it would already trigger the rehashing to decrease its size.",

      "body": "On my system the rehash policy is the  prime less than double policy, which ensures that we have a growth factor < 2 for all resizes. So in the case of 256, we would first \"double\" to 503. Then we would be at 257/503 \"fullness\", where half would be 251. So we can remove up to 6 elements before triggering a re-hash. So the pathological cases are a bit more precise, see below:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're at exactly 251, then you add one, you double to 503, and then you can remove two before triggering a rehash (strict inequality). Let's say you choose to remove a third. Then you'll rehash to either 467 or 257 (implementations depending -- I believe it's usually 257 because we go to the smallest prime larger than N). That means you will need to remove down to 233 (~20 more elements) before triggering a rehash OR more likely ~125 elements. Let's say instead, if you add back another N, you won't trigger a rehash until you hit 467, so you can add back another ~215 elements before having to go again OR more likely, 7 elements.\r\n\r\nSo there is a case to be made that it's less than ideal, but it's not quite as bad given the primes.\r\n\r\nThere's also a case to be made (at least for the use cases I'm looking at) where you're usually in a streak of erases, followed by a streak of adds. So while it is possible to trigger the bad behavior, it's atypical.\r\n\r\nTherefore I don't actually think it's that bad to use half as the shrink test, given that it quickly gets us shrunk to a more than half full table.\r\n\r\nBut if we do a resize at, say, at n <= (buckets - (buckets/100)*54), and resize to (n + (n/100)*36), then we can always be able to add at least 36% after a resize and remove 1/(1 + 0.36*1.08) - 0.36 ~~ 36% more before resizing again.  (The ~1.08 more than 36% I think, is half the average overshoot prime to prime. This is not a great estimate but can be improved).",
