      "body": "> I was playing around with this type of timing earlier and read that I should be wary of rdtsc getting reordered with respect to other instructions\r\n\r\nYes, both the compiler and the CPU pipeline may reorder it. In this specific case it's not too bad, though, because the call is already from a function (State::KeepRunning) called inside the benchmark. So there is quite some overhead already, making reordering by a few instructions probably unnoticeable in the noise.\r\n\r\n> and that if you can't use rdtscp instead, then you should add a serializing instruction first like cpuid. \r\n\r\nI didn't know that. Although rdtscp seems not to be available on all x86 processors. I'll leave that as a future improvement.\r\n\r\nx86 is already precise and low-overhead compared to the ARM path which has to do a syscall (the instructions aren't available to user-space).\r\n\r\n> Also do you not have any issues with the thread migrating to another core? I had to set cpu affinity.\r\n\r\nIndeed, calling bench with e.g. `taskset -c 0 bench_bitcoin` will likely get more precise cycle measurements.",
