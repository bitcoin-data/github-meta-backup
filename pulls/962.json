    "body": "old behaviour:\n- if -maxconnections is 0 or negative, no connection to the network was established at all\n- the maximum number of connections was in range 0 to 8 (125 was unused)\n\nnew behavior:\n- if -maxconnections is 0 or negative, MIN_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS will be used to ensure connectivity\n- if -maxconnections is unset Gavins intended default of 125 is used\n- if -maxconnections is > MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS, MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS is used\n\nPerhaps the value of MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS and MIN_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS should be refined further.\n\nI tested the changes on Windows and can confirm they work. Oh and I think this \"bug\" or let's say strange behaviour was introduced by Gavins commit to set defaults to 125. I was so sure, that I saw more than 8 connections before 0.6, but no one seems to have noticed?\n",

Yea its not hard, but you have to atleast be able to compile bitcoin, whereas making it easy to do with just command line flags opens us up to \"Your node may be under-performing (because your connection bar doesnt have full bars!) you should set -maxconnections or -outboundconnections high to get full bars\".  See; the -hubmode crap that was popular a while ago...\nNote: the connection bar wont let you have full bars without INCOMING connections to encourage people to properly forward their ports, not to make them find more outgoing connections.\n",

The first thing the loop does is count the number of outbound connections, and if the maximum has been reached (8 or -maxconnections), then it goes into a 2 second delay loop until the count is below the max.\"\n\nThat code is in ThreadOpenConnections2 and I'm asking, if the wiki is obsolete or the code has a bug, because -maxconnections will never be > 8, because of \"min(8, (int)GetArg(\"-maxconnections\", 125)\" and will allow to disable outbound connections completely if you set -maxconnections=0 or < 0.\n\nInbound connections are handled via ThreadSocketHandler2 and I should simply remove that change and we can safely ignore that in the discussion from now on :).\n",
