    "body": "We are all aware of alternative implementations of the bitcoin protocol. I've even helped personally implement [two](https://github.com/indutny/bcoin) of [them](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore). There is an obvious fundamental problem with all alternative implementations that I'm sure everyone here sees: They're not bug-for-bug compatible with Satoshi's original implementation.\n\nAs we see more and more production platforms ([BitPay](https://bitpay.com/), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Circle](https://www.circle.com/), [Blockchain](https://blockchain.info/), etc.) that _absolutely_ depend on the adamant stability of their platform, with **so** much at stake, it is imperative that their backend protocol implementation be 100% compatible with the original protocol. That is non-trivial, and maybe even impossible to do with an alternative implementation.\n\nPlatforms and services like this are forced to use bitcoind as a backend on their servers if they want stability. Using just bitcoind with RPC calls has a number of limitations and hurdles.\n\n---\n\nThis pull request alters the autoconf files to allow something like this:\n\n``` bash\n$ git clone git://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git\n$ cd bitcoin\n$ ./autogen.sh\n$ ./configure --enable-daemonlib\n$ make\n...\n$ ls -la src/libbitcoind.so\n```\n\nAny program, or binding for a platform (python, php, node.js, ruby, etc), can now link to the official bitcoin implementation. Luckily bitcoind decided not to use `static` functions and put function templates in every header file, which means linkage to any function in bitcoind should be fairly easily as every function is exposed to the program which links to it.\n## An Example\n\n``` bash\n# Write a program which links to libbitcoind\necho '#include \"bitcoind.h\"' > my_program.cc\necho '#include \"...\"' >> my_program.cc\necho 'extern bool AppInit(int, char **);' >> my_program.cc\necho 'int main(int argc, char **argv) {' >> my_program.cc\necho '  return AppInit(argc, argv) ? 0 : 1;' >> my_program.cc\necho '}' >> my_program.cc\n\n# Compile our program\ngcc -I$HOME/bitcoin/src -I$HOME/bitcoin/src/obj \\\n  -I$HOME/bitcoin/src/config -I$HOME/bitcoin/src/leveldb/include \\\n  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -g -O2 -fexceptions -frtti -fpermissive \\\n  -o my_program my_program.cc \\\n  -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem -lboost_program_options \\\n  -lboost_thread -lboost_chrono -lssl -lcrypto \\\n  $HOME/bitcoin/src/libbitcoind.so\n\n# Start our process\n./my_program -server -daemon\n\n# Bitcoind logs should be spitting out\ntail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log\n```\n\nA contrived example: Obviously this capability would most likely be used to link to different platforms' modules/bindings with that binding being dynamically loaded into python's/node.js'/php's/ruby's memory.\n### A More Complete Example\n\nAt BitPay, I have written a fully fledged node.js binding which links to `libbitcoind.so` and can do almost anything an alternative bitcoin implementation can do. It is called [bitcoind.js](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcoind.js).\n\nFeel free to examine the [documentation](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcoind.js/blob/master/README.md#documentation) and [source](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcoind.js/blob/master/src/bitcoindjs.cc) to see the actual [benefits](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcoind.js/blob/master/lib/bitcoind.js) something like this would provide.\n## What this PR does:\n- Moves `main()` out of `bitcoind.cpp` and into `bitcoind_main.cpp`. Moves all includes and variables out of `bitcoind.cpp` and into `bitcoind.h` so it can be included by both `bitcoind.cpp` and `bitcoind_main.cpp` if necessary.\n- Exposes two or three functions in header files which will be useful for different platforms linking to libbitcoind. This required creating an `rpcwallet.h` header file.\n- Adds `--enable-daemonlib` argument to `configure.ac` - this enables `-fPIC` for all object files instead of -`fPIE`. It also sets an AM conditional which is checked for in the automake file. Also resets `-fvisibility` to its default.\n- When compiling the library, automake makes use of this `AM_CONDITIONAL` such that targets are overridden by one `all:` target compiling the library, and bitcoin-qt(+tests) is ignored.\n- Now that all object files can be compiled as position independent code, the custom `Makefile` target I've added (vanilla Make syntax - I'm sure automake can do something fancier and compile a shared object through the help of libtool, but I couldn't manage to make it work) can link these object files together into `libbitcoind.so` with `-shared -fPIC`.\n## Issues and potential annoyances:\n\nI figure I'll address these since I'm fairly certain these questions will be raised.\n- If you want to compile bitcoind or bitcoin-qt, the object files compiled for libbitcoind are essentially useless since they're not `-fPIE`. You have to clean and recompile for scratch.\n- Since bitcoind was never structured like a proper library, it's essentially one big mess: there is logging and arg parsing all over the place. A coder's best bet is to write their own stripped down version of `AppInit2()` which starts up the net.cpp threads and listens for `RequestShutdown`, eventually joining all threads. Currently, bitcoind.js simply starts up `AppInit2()` on a separate thread.\n- Name Mangling: Node.js module bindings are written in C++. Lua and Ruby bindings are canonically written in C, which means in order to use libbitcoind without guessing bizarre function names, functions will have to be exposed with `extern \"C\"` on non-OO functions to force the stopping of mangled names. Of course, the workaround would be for Lua and Ruby users to write a C++ wapper and then link to them from their C binding.\n- Internal API: When I first started writing bitcoind.js, I forked bitcoin v0.9.0 and turned it into a shared library. Once I rebased it onto the latest master, a lot of functions had changed and took differen params, a lot of classes were changed or added. I had to rewrite several functions. Any program depending on libbitcoind.so will have to deal with this as bitcoind is developed since it is not developed like a library.\n- The Build: I'm sure there's a slicker way to compile this as an `.so`. I'm really not an Automake guru. I've fooled around a bit with the build here, but at the end of the day, someone smarter than me could probably do a better job at writing a `src/Makefile.daemon.include`.\n  \n  The `noinst_LIBRARIES` libraries and other magical features of automake are simply ignored when `--enable-daemonlib` is used. The .mm.o target compiles all the object files necessary to link them up into a shared library with a vanilla make target.\n- Platforms: I'm not terribly familiar with OSX, but right now, I've only tested this build on Linux (Arch). I've had two friends try to build on OSX with unfortunate results that were apparently common in trying to compile bitcoind on OSX. I'm still unsure if this will work with Macintoshes. I have even less of an idea of how windows works compared to OSX.  Maybe it could be made into a `.dll` somehow.\n## The Score\n\nThere may be better ways of doing this, but I think if the future of bitcoin and the bitcoin world is to be a bright one, bitcoind _needs_ to be reshaped into an optional library in some form. I don't only speak on behalf of my employer here ([BitPay](https://bitpay.com/)), even though I'm sure we all agree. This also happens to be my personal opinion on the matter.\n\nI open this to discussion. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make Bitcoin into a library.\n",

The planned libscript/consensus/whatever is an example of something with a very simple API and we're really close to tiny near-dependencyless implementation for it.\n\nI really prefer starting with easily-separatable parts here...\n",

      "body": "> Yes, this seems like a very bad idea to structure it this way - exposing lots and lots of bitcoin core's internal interfaces externally is very poor library design as those interfaces are nearly guaranteed to change.\n\nYes, I mentioned the burden of keeping what is normally an internal API stable in my PR. However, I see this as a problem for the platform binding maintainers, not the bitcoin core devs. I would rather change my bitcoind.js project with every update than hamstring bitcoin's improvements by forcing it to follow the traditional model of a library with a stable API.\n\nI originally started writing bitcoind.js based off a fork of bitcoin v0.9.0 (it was just what I was more familiar with at the time, and it happened to be code from roughly 8 months ago). After rebasing onto the latest HEAD, it took me maybe an afternoon to update the code for the new internal functions, classes, types, etc: That's **8 month's** worth of API changes updated in an afternoon. I don't think it will be that difficult for library authors to keep up, short of a major, major refactor.\n\nI also want to make it clear, that bitcoind.js, for example, is a **full** bitcoin node. _It simply **is** bitcoind_, just running inside a node.js process. It creates a wallet, finds peers, and downloads the blockchain as soon as it starts. bitcoind.js is sort of a proof-of-concept right now, but I hope to make it production-ready soon. bitcoind.js can access any block or transaction, listen for block and transaction events as they come in, verify blocks and transactions, send bitcoins with automatically constructed transactions based on any available unspent outputs, or build a transaction manually and broadcast it. It has enough features to be useful.\n\nUsers of this or other similar libraries essentially can run bitcoind with their own programmatic enhancements. This is a huge step up from simply making RPC calls to a bitcoind server.\n\nAlso, the coders using bitcoind.js only see the **external documented JS API**. They don't have to deal with the nitty gritty bitcoin core API. As long as whatever library (for whatever platform, be it python, ruby, etc) stays up to date with bitcoin's internal interface, the only people who have to worry about it are the library maintainers, like myself. It isn't as difficult as it may seem at first.\n\nI may be wrong, but I don't see this as much of a change. It's all hidden behind a compile-time flag. Very little has to change in the codebase. You can simply forget about it if you want to. Don't bother worrying about maintaining a stable API. Leave that to the platform library maintainers, or maybe there could be one well-maintained global wrapper for it as mentioned. Who knows?\n\nI heard the `-export-dynamic`/`-rdynamic` argument mentioned here and there (which maybe only works with gcc? I suppose it doesn't work with clang, now the compiler of choice for Apple machines), which builds a binary which is both linkable/dlopen'able and executable. I think that's a great idea. Anything to make this simpler is good. Like I said, the build could be improved. That's why I posted this.\n\nPersonally, I can live with OSX users not being able to use this because I'm a total linux fiend, however, the ability for programmers to test on OSX is also probably important. All that being said, if this option does end up being used, `-fvisibility` would still most likely have to be set to default on all object files (correct me if I'm wrong). This is mentioned in my post and apparent in the diff.\n\nI've spent the last several months working on two different alternative bitcoin implementations, yet I've decided I want to eventually write my own main wallet based on bitcoind.js or something like it.\n\nMy first attempt at a bitcoin wallet was using JSON RPC calls to bitcoind, and it was **extremely** limited. After two pull requests here trying to improve the RPC calls to make them more reasonable, I was shot down twice. So, I guess I took to more drastic measures: I wanted something better, and something that is not an alternative implementation.\n\nAnyway, that's all I really have to say. Thanks for the consideration at the very least. I was hoping there would be a few more proponents, but whatever the decision, I trust it leads bitcoin in the right direction. I figure most here are likely to be in a better position to determine that than me.\n",

The drawback is that whatever you're developing needs to be developed in lock-step with bitcoin core's internals, but for some uses that can be acceptable.\n\nFor those uses the only feasible way right now is to manually patch bitcoind to yield a library, or re-implement everything (as bitcoin-pythonlib did). I went with using bitcoin-pythonlib in my case. But I'm not opposed to doing this (IF it can be done without impact to other library-zation efforts such as the consensus library).\n\nEdit: `-rdynamic` sounds like a nice solution though. I hadn't though of that...\n",

I think it can be useful anyway and isn't too intrusive to the current build even if it appears to be a step in the wrong direction at first glance. I do like the way you did it and I'm glad you learned something about libtool (meanwhile I'm still trying to figure all of it out). :)\n\nAs of now, I've rewritten the `Makefile.daemon.include` to make it much simpler, with no hardcoded list of object files, so bitcoin core devs likely don't have to bother with modifying it much in the future. They can simply ignore it. Furthermore, leave the worrying of the API to the devs using this and wrapping it. There's no need to create a documented stable API.\n\nAlso, as a minuscule aside, you'll notice I've also renamed bitcoind_main.cpp to bitcoin-main.cpp to match source file naming convention.\n\n(NOTE: It still doesn't build on OSX: OSX seems to require some esoteric magic in order to work. If someone could give insight into that it would be fantastic. I don't have an OSX installation of my own, so I can't really test too often).\n",
