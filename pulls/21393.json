The mainnet parameters were discussed on the mailing list, the testnet ones were made up in the process of writing this PR because no one discussed testnet activation parameters.\r\n\r\nFor regtest, I chose to mirror the number of retarget periods that mainnet would experience, just on the regtest threshold and retarget period.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a small test for activating on regtest.\r\n\r\nRequires #21392",

There are devs who concept NACK’d MTP. Were these devs comprehensively polled for their opinions in light of this new change?\r\n\r\nMany (including myself, note that I had NACK'd a previous iteration of #21377) were as they were part of the discussions that took place on the IRC channel. Changes to #21377 have been made that I personally find acceptable.\r\n\r\n> But someone else should probably open a new PR with the changes.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to focus review and attention on a single proposal rather than competing proposals. Many contributors have stated that they will not provide in depth review to either proposal until a specific one is chosen. So this was closed in order to focus review onto the other proposal. From the IRC discussions, it appears that #21377 has rough consensus and has a reasonable chance of being the proposal that is actually used. However, if it is found to be deficient, then this PR will be reopened.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the discussions was that most were okay with either this PR or #21377, and the decision for which to move forward on fell to the PR authors. As such, the objections to this PR and #21377 were analyzed, and we determined that #21377 could be modified that satisfied all of my objections to it, but no solutions could be found for the objections brought for this PR. There are others who still object to #21377 but they have not provided any concrete/specific objections when asked. Therefore #21377 has rough consensus and this PR does not.",

That's not a consensus decision, it's an individual's decision based on where he thinks consensus is headed.  The result of that decision is Andrew closing his own PR---an action we (and GitHub) have always allowed PR openers to make unilaterally---and him putting his effort into helping 21377 get merged, at least for as long as he thinks that's the best use of his energy.\r\n\r\nThat seems to me like an entirely reasonable position.

      "body": "I'm doing no such thing.\r\n\r\n> Most communication about Bitcoin Core development happens on IRC, in the #bitcoin-core-dev channel on Freenode. The easiest way to participate on IRC is with the web client, webchat.freenode.net. Chat history logs can be found on http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/ and http://gnusha.org/bitcoin-core-dev/.\r\n> Discussion about codebase improvements happens in GitHub issues and pull requests.\r\n> The developer mailing list should be used to discuss complicated or controversial consensus or P2P protocol changes before working on a patch set.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not against any policy for consensus decisions to be made in IRC, nor were any made beyond personal commitments to review one PR or another, so you must be mistaken. Further, bitcoin core's CONTRIBUTING.md is not binding. Note that everything is a _should_. If folks choose to discuss in other venues that is more than fine, as long as the process is inclusive. \r\n\r\nWhat I did was organize and host 2 meetings and summarize meeting notes from each. The meetings were scheduled well in advance such that anyone could join, and were announced also on #bitcoin-core-dev IRC at the start to get any stragglers in. The ##taproot-activation channel was explicitly made to serve as a venue for anyone interested to discuss activation, and to allow the main core development channel to maintain focus on other work. \r\n\r\nWhen you don't have a substantive critique of work being done, it's natural to claim a process and procedure fault. But the process has been open for anyone to participate and I've put ample personal work into organizing and summarizing. If there is a process you think that is more conducive to consensus, feel free to take the lead on implementing it.\r\n\r\nI'm certainly not ignoring anyone who disagrees with me. My intention with hosting the meetings was to be able to cast a wide net for opinions and share back outcomes of that to the mailing list. I've responded in good faith to other developers whose positions I disagree with, and held organized space for others to voice their concerns. There was no censorship of content in the meetings, and all views were responded to there.\r\n\r\nI'm glad to hear that you did read the logs. I'm more curious in your comment for you to substantiate\r\n\r\n> There were serious concerns raised by respected developers about MTP as recently as two days ago. There are devs who concept NACK’d MTP. Were these devs comprehensively polled for their opinions in light of this new change?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two NACKs I am aware of are from Luke and from Rusty. I cannot personally say that their NACKs are irrelevant, but it seems to be the sentiment among developers given that Luke has declined to substantiate his NACK with a technical argument e.g.:\r\n\r\n> 16:36 < achow101> luke-jr: michaelfolkson: Can you articulate technical reasons why you are opposed to MTP? I get that heights were agreed upon previously, however things are not static. There have been changes proposed to the MTP implementation that would allow for a UASF.\r\n16:36 < luke-jr> jeremyrubin: miners don't decide\r\n16:37 < roasbeef> luke-jr: I think that's been discussed ad nauseam\r\n16:37 < jeremyrubin> we've used a coin flip to break a stalemate so people feel comfortable spending review energy, and then the proposal isn't \"decided\" it's then put forth for clients to upgrade to, and even then it's not final, miners have to signal\r\n16:37 < luke-jr> jeremyrubin: achow's PR is already 100% reviewed\r\n16:37 < luke-jr> there is also zero reason to even cosnider MTP\r\n16:37 < achow101> luke-jr: why?\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/JeremyRubin/status/1379591448425734148\r\n\r\netc\r\n\r\nIt seems not to matter much W.R.T. achieving consensus for luke, as _whatever_ client is released by core, Luke seems dead set on preparing a UASF client with chain split risk (which has been NACK'd by many many contributors for years and years now, speaking of ignoring consensus). \r\n\r\n& WRT to rusty's NACK, it's been addressed here  https://gist.github.com/michaelfolkson/92899f27f1ab30aa2ebee82314f8fe7f#gistcomment-3695024 as well as on the mailing list. Further, Rusty's NACK is not technical in nature, it's procedural, as he's previously noted that the activation mechanisms themselves are probably sufficient for activating, he just dislikes the precedent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there other NACKs I am missing?\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the NACKs, there are many ACKs on a speedy trial w.r.t. harding's post https://gist.github.com/michaelfolkson/92899f27f1ab30aa2ebee82314f8fe7f for either MTP or Height, many ACKs for this approach during the meeting, and a myriad of developers who are working towards reviewing AJ's pull request to ensure it is technically sound. Further, it's not new quantum physics, it is minor tweaks to an existing activation mechanism. Activation mechanisms do not generally have the same bar for consensus as do changes to bitcoin like Taproot because we aren't \"stuck with them\" beyond the single instance they are used. So whereas deep technical consensus on e.g. Taproot is much more critical, the activation code we're working on need only work once (that doesn't mean insecure code would pass review). Lastly, most users/developers/etc seem to be more concerned with _when_ taproot will be available, as opposed to if it is MTP or height. As such the meeting's have been making an effort to coordinate review for a release sometime this month, so Taproot can be active in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly I just want to note that I do appreciate your concern for wanting to make sure voices are heard and represented, hence I'll repeat my earlier question to check and see if you have any technical concerns with the current proposal you feel have not been addressed as of yet.",

      "body": "The ACK/NACK system is broken so I stopped using that terminology after the segwit debacle. But it seems I have no voice here unless I state my position clearly in those terms, so here it is:\r\n\r\nI'm NACK taproot, for reasons I've published elsewhere. Counter-factually assuming that were not the case, then I'm NACK speedy trial for the same reasons Rusty has given on the mailing list. Now finally assuming that I was for taproot via speedy trial, then I'd be NACK MTP and approach-ACK a BIP8(LOT=false) with just a few technical concerns regarding thresholds and start/stop heights that I'm ultimately flexible on.\r\n\r\nSegwit activation exposed a number of problems with the BIP9 activation state machine which was based on MTP windows. These concerns include:\r\n\r\n- Difficulty of interfacing with in-parallel activation mechanisms like BIP148, BIP91, or the presumed future LOT=true UASF for taproot. (You may not like UASF. You may be against UASF and wish is never happened. Well reality doesn't care. There will be a UASF client, that is simply a fact. That cat is out of the bag. Our job is to make sure that UASF risks are minimized for the sake of the network, which height-based activation mechanisms do better. I'm not saying MTP can't be UASF compatible, I'm just saying it's way easier to avoid foot-gunning a UASF deployment with height-based windows. And while your inner schadenfreude might laugh at a UASF foot-gun, such a chain-splitting failure affects everyone.)\r\n\r\n- Perverse timestamp-manipulation incentives for miners, who can use timestamp manipulation to slow or speed up MTP to delay or speed up the closing of an activation window. People rely on accurate MTP timestamps for things like lock times, and of course it affects difficulty adjustments, and so it is very bad for there to be incentives for miners to manipulate timestamps.\r\n\r\n- Two-week uncertainty over activation window start or end times based on alignment of 2016-block window with calendar dates. Makes it very difficult for people to schedule travel or events around a single likely activation date (+/- a day or two). This affects not just activation parties (which is a silly reason IMHO, even more so in the midst of a pandemic), but also mining and infrastructure organizations which will want staff at hand in case there are activation issues.\r\n\r\n- BIP8 was specifically created to codify our lessons learned from activating segwit into a new activation protocol to be used in the next soft-fork. It got significant review 4 years ago and in the time since, and was strengthened by that review. There is no way that some new state machine for MTP-based activation could receive the same amount of review in the speedy trial timeline. We should use the reviewed mechanisms that are already in place (or very nearly so) and which incorporate lessons learned. If you think there are flaws in BIP8(LOT=false), then start working now on an alternative activation mechanism for the *next* soft-fork.\r\n\r\nEvery single one of the above points has been made on the mailing list or in relevant Github discussions. I don't think that any of them have been adequately addressed by MTP advocates. For example, pointing out that \"timewarp could cause more uncertainty than +/- 2 weeks\" ignores a few facts: (1) timewarp is NOT a normal condition and would itself be seen as an attack on the network; (2) timewarp would require the coordination of more miners than it would take to block taproot anyway; and (3) having monotonically decreasing estimation error without a two-week floor is critical to scheduling needs.\r\n\r\nI think many of us who were involved in that prior work that went into segwit lessons learned and BIP8 review are sitting around dumbfounded and speechless at what has happened. What is the point of doing all that advanced planning if it's immediately thrown away precisely when it is needed? I'm not surprised if Luke-Jr and Jorge seem obstinate on this. They've invested literally years on this problem so that we'd have a solution when it is needed, as it is now, and getting buy-in from the developers at the time... only to have all that casually thrown away. (Because of a freaking coin flip?)\r\n\r\nSo instead of doing useful work, I am here getting nerd-sniped into a technical discussion about MTP-vs-height which I thought was settled four years ago. And you know what, I have better things to do so I won't be commenting further and won't bother reviewing #21377. It has a concept-NACK from me.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nBut the matter of process there are some things here that are important to discuss. We have always, always held the mailing list to be the ground truth for consensus in theory, and in practice have used GitHub for this purpose as well. Consensus decisions have not been made in person or on IRC. Discussion happens, of course, but not polling of developer consensus. That happens on Github and via mailing list discussions.\r\n\r\nTo have an IRC meeting (at an inconvenient time for many participants!) make a consensus-affecting decision about Bitcoin Core is ridiculous. To have done by coin flip is just plain insulting to those of us who have actually invested review effort into this and have strong technical arguments for one side or the other. If it was a joke it was in bad taste.\r\n\r\nNothing is wrong with @achow101 and @ajtowns deciding what they want to focus their time and effort on based on an IRC discussion. That's cool. But don't assume it is more than that. There are a lot more stakeholders involved.\r\n\r\nBtw @JeremyRubin, *should* is a synonym for *must* in technical and procedural contexts.",

People rely on accurate MTP timestamps for things like lock times, and of course it affects difficulty adjustments, and so it is very bad for there to be incentives for miners to manipulate timestamps.\r\n\r\nI know you said you're not planning on commenting further, but I'm unaware of these incentives in the absence of a UASF.  If a UASF is done with AJ's branch above, then all miners can do is delay activation---which they can also do with a height-based approach by not mining blocks.  Arguably, it's better to use the MTP mechanism that allows miners to continue producing blocks at a reasonable rate for a while (until difficulty changes kick in, assuming they don't timewarp) so the economy keeps functioning than it is to lose that hash rate entirely.\r\n\r\n> Two-week uncertainty over activation window start or end times based on alignment of 2016-block window with calendar dates. \r\n\r\nThis is the first I've heard of anyone saying it was important to them to staff for start and end times.  I've only previously heard (and expressed) this concern related to activation time, which in BIP9 and 21377 are based on heights (BIP9 a relative 2016 blocks; 21377 a static min_activation_height, if used).  BIP8 also uses a relative 2016 blocks for voluntary miner activations and a static activation height for forced activations, so I'm not sure what your concern is here regarding activation.\r\n\r\n> BIP8 was specifically created to codify our lessons learned from activating segwit into a new activation protocol to be used in the next soft-fork. It got significant review 4 years ago and in the time since, and was strengthened by that review. \r\n\r\nBIP8 has also been modified for speedy trial, so I don't think the argument for conservatism is well founded.",

This means that for mixed MTP-based activation schemes it is impossible to pick a single absolute height or time beyond which you can be certain that the activation mechanism has failed.\r\n\r\nThis is unlike a fully height-based solution like BIP8 where adding UASF can be as simple as a literal one-liner, turning `if (VVersionBitsState(...) == ACTIVE)` into `if (VVersionBitsState(...) == ACTIVE || height > UASF)` where `UASF` is the height of activation after lockin following the last signaling period.\r\n\r\nThat's not how LOT=true works in BIP8, but it would be a totally safe UASF activation mechanism if Bitcoin Core were to release with BIP8(LOT=false). And my point is that we have a responsibility to either (a) offer LOT=true as a configuration parameter (Rusty's argument, and my own); or (b) design activation mechanism which have these sorts of perfectly safe, trivial to review UASF mechanisms built-in.\r\n\r\nAlso I think this point need making: there will be a UASF client. I don't know if there will be a UASF movement like we saw last time, but there will be a UASF client. The lesson I learned from 2017 is that \"devs propose, miners activate, users override\" isn't statement about fallback mechanisms but rather how things need to be structured *from the beginning*. I was not the only one to learn this lesson.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I won't be making a UASF client myself or having my miners run it is because I think taproot shouldn't activate. But there are others from that 2017 time who I won't name who feel the same as I do regarding lessons learned and who I have no doubt will make and run a UASF client.\r\n\r\nWhat we don't know now is whether the UASF movement will be fridge, principled radicals or a real movement like it was in 2017. But to assume that there will be *NO* UASF client is a fantasy.\r\n\r\n> I'm unaware of these incentives in the absence of a UASF.\r\n\r\nYou can use timewarp to keep MTP in the past prior to the start point, and keep it there for the entire duration, and then zoom it forward to the present with a mere six blocks once the wall clock has exited the activation window. That would skip activation entirely.\r\n\r\nIt's an unlikely outcome I think because it takes less hash power to simply block activation than to execute a timewarp, and the timewarp is more destructive. But we should nevertheless choose designs that have defense in depth against possible attacks, on the justification that we can't see all possible motivations for executing such an attack. E.g. maybe a miner wants to do a timewarp attack anyway (to play out subsidy) and then uses blocking taproot as more agreeable excuse for why they did it, to try and get away with it.\r\n\r\nIt's better to use height-based activation windows because it blocks off the possibility of an activation-related timewarp entirely, instead of a fragile argument about miner incentives.\r\n\r\n> This is the first I've heard of anyone saying it was important to them to staff for start and end times.\r\n\r\nAny state machine transition should be watched in realtime, not just activation. Especially if it is a first-time deployment using a new state machine.\r\n\r\n> BIP8 has also been modified for speedy trial, so I don't think the argument for conservatism is well founded.\r\n\r\nThe modification for speedy trial could be as simple as extending the lock-in period from one 2016 block period to twelve, or approximately six months. That would be, again, a literal one-liner change to BIP8 and does not modify the state machine structure itself. My conservatism is over the size of the code delta from BIP8 or BIP9.",

You're comparing apples to oranges.\r\n\r\nYes you can do a similar one-liner with #21377. But with some bad choices of parameters and/or some serious chain manipulation by miners you end up in edge cases with undesired outcomes. These are edge cases that are supremely unlikely to happen by chance, but that doesn't mean we can ignore them. There may be entities out there that want to timewarp the chain (for that sweet, sweet subsidy) and are looking for an excuse.

The concern is that signets being created now will require every one of their users to run with custom parameters (or a custom client) if they want to use future height-activated soft forks on that network.  That's a coordination headache that would be nice to avoid.\r\n\r\n> Are you talking about the fact that AJ's design forces at least one consideration period? We're already conditioning this discussion on a timewarp attack being executed, which requires enough of a mining cartel to also block taproot activation. So I'm not sure why you think it would still activate?\r\n\r\nWe're talking about UASF where activation is mandatory.  In an MTP UASF, that guaranteed consideration period becomes the mandatory signaling period, so (As I said) all miners can do is delay.  In my original response, I also noted: \"[miners] can also [delay] with a height-based approach by not mining blocks. Arguably, it's better to use the MTP mechanism that allows miners to continue producing blocks at a reasonable rate for a while (until difficulty changes kick in, assuming they don't timewarp) so the economy keeps functioning than it is to lose that hash rate entirely.\"\r\n\r\n(As an aside, I don't think timewarp is a realistic concern.  It's easy to detect, it's a problem for all Bitcoin users, it's easy to block on an ad hoc basis, and it's easy to deploy a tradeoff-free soft fork permanently eliminating it as a concern.  At least it's easy if we can agree on an activation mechanism :-)",
