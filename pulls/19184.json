    "body": "This replaces the transaction request logic with an encapsulated class that maintains all the state surrounding it. By keeping it stand alone, it can be easily tested (using included unit tests and fuzz tests).\r\n\r\nThe new logic is close in spirit to the current one, but much easier to specify I think:\r\n* Always prefer outbound peers over inbound peers, as long as any are available.\r\n* Don't download from inbound peers during the first 2 s after announcement, to give time for announcements from outbound peers to come in.\r\n* The peer who is the very first to announce a txid is preferred (compared to other inbounds or other outbounds), so that chains of dependent transactions announced by one peer will generally not be split out to other peers.\r\n* After the peer that announces a txid first, requests go to uniformly selected peers (outbounds first; inbounds that are past their 2 s delay afterwards), to minimize the impact an attacker can have (as attackers can easily race the network and be first).\r\n* A txid is never requested twice from the same peer, as long as other candidates remain (even when reannounced).\r\n* Transactions are requested from new candidates as soon as old requests expire, or NOTFOUND is received, or invalid-witness transactions are received (i.e. this includes the functionality added by, and replaces, #18238).\r\n\r\nOne significant change is the removal of the in-flight limit of 100 txids. I think this limit is not exactly desirable (e.g. when a txid is only announced by one peer, we should request it, regardless of how many other txids we're already waiting for), and with the changes to handle NOTFOUND immediately, there is less problems with high limits. This implementation's performance is also only determined by the number of total transaction/peer pairs tracked (O(log n)), not by the number in-flight, removing another reason for having that limit.\r\n\r\nA few further improvements could be investigated and relatively easily added if desirable:\r\n* Biasing away from peers with lots of in-flight requests (but not outright limiting like now).\r\n* Making the 2s inbound delay Poisson-distributed.\r\n* Adding a wtxid flag to entries to make it compatible with #18044.\r\n* Adding a time limit for the time between announcement and request.\r\n\r\nWhile the implementation is non-trivial due to performance and resource usage considerations, it has a significantly simpler exact specification. This specification is documented in src/txrequest.h, and reimplemented naively in the src/test/fuzz/txrequest.cpp fuzz test. It may be a good idea to review those first to understand the desired semantics before digging into the optimized implementation.\r\n",

Also as it's a critical part of the codebase how do we build confidence of the correctness of this new transaction request logic implementation with regards to substituted old part ?

If we found (or created) a replacement for that there, it should work here too, so I don't think it's much of an increase in the dependency.",

      "body": "@ariard As @ajtowns said, we're already relying on boost/multi_index for CTxMemPool. I also spent a week or two thinking about how to implement this with custom data structures, but it's... really hard to match the same performance/memory usage characteristics without multi_index. So I think it's just the right tool for the job, plus it's a headers-only library (so it doesn't introduce runtime dependencies, which is a large part of what makes boost annoying).\r\n\r\nAs far as correctness/desirability of the behavior goes:\r\n\r\n* Reasoning about whether the behavior is desirable, when considered standalone, I believe is much easier than the current one. The current behavior is very much defined by interactions of randomized insertion orders in a queue, and has few guarantees about what those actually accomplish. You can look at the fuzz test, which contains a complete reimplementation of the semantics (without optimized performance).\r\n\r\n* At a (very) high level you can see that the existing behavior is maintained (apart from the max-in-flight rule) by looking at the changes in test/functional/p2p_tx_download.py. But at a lower level it's again hard to say much because the existing behavior is already so hard to describe exactly.",

The idea is that this would prevent an attacker who races announcements, but doesn't respond, will (as soon as they reach their max-in-flight) not be able to interfere with chains of dependent transactions (which we'd like to request from the same peer).\r\n\r\nThis seems like a good idea, and easy to implement, but it'll require some changes to tests.",

This matches reality more closely (as the `outbound` property wasn't exactly for outbound peers, but also other whitelisted ones). It is also more compatible with the approach taken in #18044 (where the delay becomes a function of both outboundness and wtxidness).\r\n* Renamed CANDIDATE_NEW to CANDIDATE_DELAYED\r\n* Renamed CANDIDATE_OTHER to CANDIDATE_READY\r\n\r\nAs there are still other changes I want to make to the behavior, I've marked this as Draft for now.",

The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one.

It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer is inbound, this will always prefer an\n+ *     outbound peer as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout).

When a\n+ * NOTFOUND is received, an invalid transaction is received, or a download times out (after a configurable delay),\n+ * the next candidate is immediately scheduled according to the same rules above. The same transaction is never\n+ * re-requested from the same peer, unless the transaction was forgotten about in the mean time. This happens\n+ * whenever no candidates remain, or when a transaction is successfully received.\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * === Specification ===\n+ *\n+ * The data structure maintains a collection of entries:\n+ *\n+ * - CANDIDATE (txid, peer, reqtime) entries representing txids that were announced by peer, and become available for\n+ *   download after reqtime has passed (which is immediately for outbound peers, and inbound_delay after announcement\n+ *   for inbound ones).\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer is inbound, this will always prefer an\n+ *     outbound peer as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between.

When a\n+ * NOTFOUND is received, an invalid transaction is received, or a download times out (after a configurable delay),\n+ * the next candidate is immediately scheduled according to the same rules above. The same transaction is never\n+ * re-requested from the same peer, unless the transaction was forgotten about in the mean time. This happens\n+ * whenever no candidates remain, or when a transaction is successfully received.\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * === Specification ===\n+ *\n+ * The data structure maintains a collection of entries:\n+ *\n+ * - CANDIDATE (txid, peer, reqtime) entries representing txids that were announced by peer, and become available for\n+ *   download after reqtime has passed (which is immediately for outbound peers, and inbound_delay after announcement\n+ *   for inbound ones).\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer is inbound, this will always prefer an\n+ *     outbound peer as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between.

The behaviour you describe (not rerequesting an orphan transaction from another announcing peer if we later discover that its witness is mutated) also exists in master. As soon as we put a transaction in `mapOrphanTransactions` it'll return true from `AlreadyHave()` and will then be removed from each peer's `TxDownloadState`.\r\n\r\nI think it's ok to keep this behaviour. Orphan handling is to some extent best effort, so shouldn't be relied on for timely transaction propagation. If an adversary is able to poison a transaction in the orphan set, then we won't rerequest it from other peers when `AcceptToMemoryPool()` fails, but it won't be added to our recent rejects filter, and if just one other peer later announces it to us, we'll attempt to fetch it again.",

When a\n+ * NOTFOUND is received, an invalid transaction is received, or a download times out (after a configurable delay),\n+ * the next candidate is immediately scheduled according to the same rules above. The same transaction is never\n+ * re-requested from the same peer, unless the transaction was forgotten about in the mean time. This happens\n+ * whenever no candidates remain, or when a transaction is successfully received.\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * === Specification ===\n+ *\n+ * The data structure maintains a collection of entries:\n+ *\n+ * - CANDIDATE (txid, peer, reqtime) entries representing txids that were announced by peer, and become available for\n+ *   download after reqtime has passed (which is immediately for outbound peers, and inbound_delay after announcement\n+ *   for inbound ones).\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer is inbound, this will always prefer an\n+ *     outbound peer as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between. Any other\n+ *   non-const operation removes the ability to call RequestedTx.\n+ */\n+class TxRequestTracker {\n+    //!

When a\n+ * NOTFOUND is received, an invalid transaction is received, or a download times out (after a configurable delay),\n+ * the next candidate is immediately scheduled according to the same rules above. The same transaction is never\n+ * re-requested from the same peer, unless the transaction was forgotten about in the mean time. This happens\n+ * whenever no candidates remain, or when a transaction is successfully received.\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * === Specification ===\n+ *\n+ * The data structure maintains a collection of entries:\n+ *\n+ * - CANDIDATE (txid, peer, reqtime) entries representing txids that were announced by peer, and become available for\n+ *   download after reqtime has passed (which is immediately for outbound peers, and inbound_delay after announcement\n+ *   for inbound ones).\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer is inbound, this will always prefer an\n+ *     outbound peer as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between. Any other\n+ *   non-const operation removes the ability to call RequestedTx.\n+ */\n+class TxRequestTracker {\n+    //!

      "body": "That's a good suggestion, but I don't think it would actually be desirable (but fortunately, it also wouldn't gain any efficiency). An earlier design of this code worked like that, but I decided to move off that.\r\n\r\nSay we're calling `GetRequestable` for peer A. There is a txid T that was announced by peer A and peer B. For some reason, peer B is currently the `CANDIDATE_BEST` peer for T, but its exptime is in the past. That means that the (T,B) pair in reality should be `COMPLETED` now (but the data structure hasn't been updated to reflect that), and peer A is actually the best match. If `GetRequestable` for A would only invoke `SetTimePoint` for currently-`CANDIDATE_BEST` entries, T won't be returned, at it'll only be when B calls `GetRequestable` that its expiration happens. This is probably not terrible behavior, but makes it *much* harder to exactly specify the behavior, and perhaps it introduces a bias in the selection - it's hard to say.\r\n\r\nThankfully, it also doesn't gain anything. Every (txid,peer) pair only ever transitions once to `COMPLETED`, so certainly in bulk work there cannot be any difference. Furthermore, `SetTimePoint` only iterates over all expired entries in its first loop, as they're sorted by time. So no time is wasted processing unexpired entries.\r\n\r\nA similar reasoning applies to the second loop.",

When a\n+ * NOTFOUND is received, an invalid transaction is received, or a download times out (after a configurable delay),\n+ * the next candidate is immediately scheduled according to the same rules above. The same transaction is never\n+ * re-requested from the same peer, unless the transaction was forgotten about in the mean time. This happens\n+ * whenever no candidates remain, or when a transaction is successfully received.\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * === Specification ===\n+ *\n+ * The data structure maintains a collection of entries:\n+ *\n+ * - CANDIDATE (txid, peer, reqtime) entries representing txids that were announced by peer, and become available for\n+ *   download after reqtime has passed (which is immediately for outbound peers, and inbound_delay after announcement\n+ *   for inbound ones).\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer is inbound, this will always prefer an\n+ *     outbound peer as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between.

We always favor non-delayed ones over delayed ones, so in `PromoteCandidateNew`, an entry from the former is likely to be favored but we sorting them uniformly randomly obviously don't favor the fastest one.

This happens whenever no candidates remain, or when a transaction is successfully received.\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * === Specification ===\n+ *\n+ * The data structure maintains a collection of entries:\n+ *\n+ * - CANDIDATE (txid, peer, reqtime) entries representing txids that were announced by peer, and become available for\n+ *   download after reqtime has passed. The reqtime can std::chrono::microseconds::min() for immediate entries,\n+ *   or some timestamp in the future for delayed ones.\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer had a delay, immediate entries will always be\n+ *     picked first as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between.

When a NOTFOUND is received, an invalid transaction is received, or a download\n+ * times out (after a configurable delay), the next candidate is immediately scheduled according to the same rules\n+ * above. The same transaction is never re-requested from the same peer, unless the transaction was forgotten about\n+ * in the mean time. This happens whenever no candidates remain, or when a transaction is successfully received.\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * === Specification ===\n+ *\n+ * The data structure maintains a collection of entries:\n+ *\n+ * - CANDIDATE (txid, peer, reqtime) entries representing txids that were announced by peer, and become available for\n+ *   download after reqtime has passed. The reqtime can std::chrono::microseconds::min() for immediate entries,\n+ *   or some timestamp in the future for delayed ones.\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call.

This is the\n+ *   case for entries from inbound non-whitelisted nodes. The priority for delayed entries is always higher than\n+ *   non-delayed ones, so non-delayed ones are always preferred.\n+ * - Within the set of delayed peers and within the set of non-delayed peers:\n+ *   - The very first announcement for a given txid is always lowest.\n+ *   - Announcements after the first one are ordered uniformly randomly (using a salted hash of txid/peer).\n+ */\n+class PriorityComputer {\n+    const uint64_t m_k0, m_k1;\n+public:\n+    explicit PriorityComputer(bool deterministic);\n+    uint64_t operator()(const uint256& txid, uint64_t peer, bool delayed, bool first) const\n+    {\n+        uint64_t low_bits = 0;\n+        if (!first) {\n+            low_bits = CSipHasher(m_k0, m_k1).Write(txid.begin(), txid.size()).Write(peer).Finalize() >> 1;\n+        }\n+        return low_bits | uint64_t{delayed} << 63;\n+    }\n+};\n+\n+/** Data structure to keep track of, and schedule, transaction downloads from peers.\n+ *\n+ * === High level behavior ===\n+ *\n+ * Transaction downloads are attempted in random order, first choosing among non-delayed peers, then delayed\n+ * ones whose delay has passed. When a NOTFOUND is received, an invalid transaction is received, or a download\n+ * times out (after a configurable delay), the next candidate is immediately scheduled according to the same rules\n+ * above. The same transaction is never re-requested from the same peer, unless the transaction was forgotten about\n+ * in the mean time. This happens whenever no candidates remain, or when a transaction is successfully received.\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * === Specification ===\n+ *\n+ * The data structure maintains a collection of entries:\n+ *\n+ * - CANDIDATE (txid, peer, reqtime) entries representing txids that were announced by peer, and become available for\n+ *   download after reqtime has passed. The reqtime can std::chrono::microseconds::min() for immediate entries,\n+ *   or some timestamp in the future for delayed ones.\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer had a delay, immediate entries will always be\n+ *     picked first as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between. Any other\n+ *   non-const operation removes the ability to call RequestedTx.\n+ */\n+class TxRequestTracker {\n+    //!

This is necessary, as otherwise you can't fairly decide what to give to which peer (the peer you're calling for may have an announcement that just became ready, but another peer may also have an announcement for the same tx with a lower priority). So it's conceptually true what you say, but only if you think of a full cycle of GetRequestable/RequestedTx for all peers.\r\n\r\nI *really* want to avoid having TxRequestTracker depend on being able to call `AlreadyHave` - it would make it much less modularized and harder to test the data structure itself.",

When a NOTFOUND is received, an invalid transaction is received, or a download\n+ * times out (after a configurable delay), the next candidate is immediately scheduled according to the same rules\n+ * above. The same transaction is never re-requested from the same peer, unless the transaction was forgotten about\n+ * in the mean time. This happens whenever no candidates remain, or when a transaction is successfully received.\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * === Specification ===\n+ *\n+ * The data structure maintains a collection of entries:\n+ *\n+ * - CANDIDATE (txid, peer, reqtime) entries representing txids that were announced by peer, and become available for\n+ *   download after reqtime has passed. The reqtime can std::chrono::microseconds::min() for immediate entries,\n+ *   or some timestamp in the future for delayed ones.\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer had a delay, immediate entries will always be\n+ *     picked first as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between.

New block announcements don't affect TxRequestTracker (except for transactions that are in the block, and we don't need anymore).\r\n\r\n> \"Assuming a fast-inbound attacker-controlled peer and low outbound not-controlled ones, a transaction propagation can be delayed at most for one GETDATA_TX_INTERVAL period\"\r\n\r\nI added a much more accurate formula.",

When a NOTFOUND is received, an invalid transaction is received, or a download\n+ * times out (after a configurable delay), the next candidate is immediately scheduled according to the same rules\n+ * above. The same transaction is never re-requested from the same peer, unless the transaction was forgotten about\n+ * in the mean time. This happens whenever no candidates remain, or when a transaction is successfully received.\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * === Specification ===\n+ *\n+ * The data structure maintains a collection of entries:\n+ *\n+ * - CANDIDATE (txid, peer, reqtime) entries representing txids that were announced by peer, and become available for\n+ *   download after reqtime has passed. The reqtime can std::chrono::microseconds::min() for immediate entries,\n+ *   or some timestamp in the future for delayed ones.\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer had a delay, immediate entries will always be\n+ *     picked first as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between. Any other\n+ *   non-const operation removes the ability to call RequestedTx.\n+ */\n+class TxRequestTracker {\n+    //!

      "body": "> I have difficulty parsing what you're trying to say here, but I've added some related comments. Please have a look to see if it's better addressed now.\r\n\r\nIIRC I meaned the following. \"Learning about a transaction identifier doesn't guarantee the node will successfully receive the transaction, no more take special steps to ensure it as sending non-solicited GETDATAs. An entry is guarantee to never stuck, assuming the local clock is moving forward\"\r\n\r\nThe first point is a minor. The second underscores an important property of new TxRequestTracker design, its state machine always progress towards a terminal state and should never halt. Though it's so obvious it's worthy to comment.\r\n\r\n> I don't understand this. New block announcements don't affect TxRequestTracker (except for transactions that are in the block, and we don't need anymore).\r\n\r\nIIRC I meaned the following scenario:\r\n* a peer announces and sends Tx 1, it is rejected due to its unconfirmed parent being invalid\r\n* all other pending requests for Tx 1 are deleted (ForgetTxHash)\r\n* the unconfirmed parent is re-announced, sent and accepted under a different wtxid\r\n* a peer announces Tx 1, the TxRequestTracker will never learn about it due to AlreadyHave()==true\r\n* a block is received, the rejection filter is received\r\n* a peer announces Tx 1, the TxRequestTracker learns and requests it\r\n\r\nThat said, not reevaluating validity of child transactions when the parent one has changed is already an existing issue. Maybe RequestTx comment could be updated to underscore that a received INV isn't unconditionally process by TxRequestTracker but depends of existing transaction relay state.",

The reqtime can std::chrono::microseconds::min() for immediate entries,\n+ *   or some timestamp in the future for delayed ones.\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer had a delay, immediate entries will always be\n+ *     picked first as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between.

As long as you have at least one non-attacker peer that announces a transaction, I believe it is probabilistically true (over time the probability of not reaching a final state, where the transaction is forgotten about, tends to 0), but not more than that. An attacker can disconnect and reconnect, and with (arbitrary) amounts of luck, an attacker can be chosen every time, making the transaction stay arbitrarily long.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it's worth going that deep in comments.\r\n\r\n> That said, not reevaluating validity of child transactions when the parent one has changed is already an existing issue. Maybe RequestTx comment could be updated to underscore that a received INV isn't unconditionally process by TxRequestTracker but depends of existing transaction relay state.\r\n\r\nI don't think this has anything to do with TxRequestTracker - it just does as it's told, and the current code in net_processing, will not immediately retry for entries in recentRejects. We can document this, but it's a far more high level thing, not specifying the behavior of the TxRequestTracker. Maybe more something for the wiki?",

The reqtime can std::chrono::microseconds::min() for immediate entries,\n+ *   or some timestamp in the future for delayed ones.\n+ *\n+ * - REQUESTED (txid, peer, exptime) entries representing txids that have been requested, and we're awaiting a\n+ *   response for from that peer. The exptime value determines when the request times out.\n+ *\n+ * - COMPLETED (txid, peer) entries representing txids that have been requested from a peer, but they timed out, a\n+ *   NOTFOUND message was received for them, or an invalid response was received. They're only kept around to prevent\n+ *   downloading them again. If only COMPLETED entries exist for a given txid remain (so no CANDIDATE or REQUESTED\n+ *   ones), all of them are deleted (this is an invariant, and maintained by all operations below).\n+ *\n+ * The following operations are supported on this data structure:\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedInv(txid, peer) adds a new CANDIDATE entry, unless one already exists for that (txid, peer) combination\n+ *   (whether it's CANDIDATE, REQUESTED, or COMPLETED).\n+ *\n+ * - DeletedPeer(peer) deletes all entries for a given peer. It should be called when a peer goes offline.\n+ *\n+ * - AlreadyHaveTx(txid) deletes all entries for a given txid. It should be called when a transaction is successfully\n+ *   added to the mempool, seen in a block, or for whatever reason we no longer care about it.\n+ *\n+ * - ReceivedResponse(peer, txid) converts any CANDIDATE or REQUESTED entry to a COMPLETED one. It should be called\n+ *   whenever a transaction or NOTFOUND was received from a peer. When the transaction is acceptable, AlreadyHaveTx\n+ *   should be called instead of (or in addition to) this operation.\n+ *\n+ * - GetRequestable(peer) does the following:\n+ *   - Convert all REQUESTED entries (for all txids/peers) with (exptime <= now) to COMPLETED entries.\n+ *   - Requestable txids are selected: txids which have no REQUESTED entry, and for which this peer has the\n+ *     lowest-priority CANDIDATE entry among all CANDIDATEs with (reqtime <= now) at the time of the GetRequestable\n+ *     call. As the high bit of the priority is whether or not the peer had a delay, immediate entries will always be\n+ *     picked first as long as one is available.\n+ *   - The selected txids are sorted in order of announcement and returned (even if multiple were added at the same\n+ *     time, or even when the clock went backwards while they were being added).\n+ *\n+ * - RequestedTx(peer, txid) converts the CANDIDATE entry for the provided peer and txid into a REQUESTED one, with\n+ *   exptime set to (now + timeout). It can ONLY be called immediately after GetRequestable was called (for the same\n+ *   peer), with only AlreadyHaveTx and other RequestedTx calls (both for other txids) in between.
