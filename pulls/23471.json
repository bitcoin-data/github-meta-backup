They are now much more detailed and help to understand these terms better.\r\n- A note is added explaining the difference in the representation of 32-byte hashes and RPC interface and block explorer.\r\n\r\nThere are no critical grammatical mistakes in the updated PR, and I find the expanded description to be logically sound and easy to understand. Great Work @mbildwic!\r\n",

This is done to make the description more robust if there is an ordering change of topics in the future.\r\n- String describing the syntax of `rawtx` and `rawblock` is added, along with the previously added syntax of `hashtx` and `hashblock`.\r\n\r\nI agree with the updated changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the description has become too lengthy, with a lot of repeated content in succession. I don’t exactly know how to tackle this. Maybe **bolding** or _italicizing_ the main difference between topics might help, but I don’t know if that would be the right approach. ",
