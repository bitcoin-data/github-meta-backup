    "body": "This feature allows for the pruning of blocks from the disk, when their blockHeight is > to the current Tip height. \r\n\r\nWhy is this needed?\r\nWell let's say you want to create a backup of the blocks & chainstate at a specific block height, you can easily do this by running `invalidateblock` and making a copy of the `blocks/` and `chainstate` folders. \r\nThe issue with creating a backup this way is that when installing a node based on it, you would run into this issue. #16353 \r\nThis feature solves this by simply removing most of the blocks that are invalidated from the disk. \r\n\r\nIf this feature gets Concept ACK, I will build the tests needed and update the PR.",

Gitian sigs can be done by anyone, not just devs.\r\n\r\nThe project in question is about 95% ready for deployment, this was the biggest roadblock. I guess it's just gonna be one more option for users to choose from, at the very least until assumeutxo is completely integrated; but I'm not sure what's this pushback is all about, if you don't like the idea of this service, that's fine, you certainly don't have to use it. \r\nI'm not sure of why we are discussing the merits of the service I'm building instead of focussing on the content of this PR: can it be useful to have in Core or not?
