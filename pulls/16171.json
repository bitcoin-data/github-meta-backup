      "body": "Concept ACK.  I'm not sure it's worth arguing over as we have plenty of more important things to do, but I do think that we should get rid of this option -- I will try to explain because I suspect there's some misunderstanding of what this option does because I don't think this is something anyone should want to use.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is not about whether we continue the BIP 125 RBF compromise where some transactions are not replaceable while others are.  Our replacement policy already gives users a choice of whether to opt their transactions in to RBF or not, and we have tools in the wallet so that transaction recipients can be aware of whether an unconfirmed transaction is subject to that replacement policy.  This PR does not change any of that.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR is proposing is to get rid of a command-line option that is (a) a footgun for users and (b) does not reflect what I believe to be the understanding most users have, which is that BIP-125-style replacement strategies are expected to propagate well on the network.\r\n\r\nTo explain further: \r\n(a) For non-miners, I do not believe there is any good reason to run with mempool replacement disabled.  Say you're a merchant who doesn't wish to receive opt-in RBF transactions -- we already report this information in the wallet so that you could go back to the customer and decline the transaction until it is either confirmed or replaced with a non-rbf signaling transaction.  Because the `-mempoolreplacement` flag does not reject RBF-signaling transactions (only their replacements!) this flag is actually counterproductive for a merchant to use, as it does not prevent their wallet from reporting receipt of a RBF-signaling transaction (ie you still need to check whether received transactions descend from RBF-signaling ones), but it DOES prevent their wallet from being aware of the transaction being replaced by the rest of the network if a conflicting one is relayed, and it even prevents their wallet from being aware of a replacement that would no longer signal RBF.\r\n\r\nFor miners: of course disabling replacement reduces fee income, so this is a footgun in that a miner using this might be unaware that they are hurting their bottom line by using it.  Not long ago we removed the ability for miners to use `getblocktemplate` without segwit-support, as we discovered some miners inadvertently were producing non-segwit blocks due to operational issues.  Removing this option is a bit like removing production of non-segwit blocks -- it's almost certainly not what the miner intends to do!\r\n\r\nBut, if a miner was trying to be thoughtful about this and doing what they believe is in the best interests of the network, they might be willing to make this tradeoff for a while -- however even then, I would think that a miner opposed to BIP 125 would much more likely want to censor _RBF-signaling transactions_ altogether, rather than just censor their _replacements_.  Imagine a merchant somewhere takes zero-conf payments and never accepts rbf-signaling transactions, and imagine there is some miner out there who is ideologically aligned as well and decides to use this command line option.  Whenever that merchant receives an RBF-signaling transaction and demands the sender replace it with a non-signaling one, it finds that their ideologically-aligned miner is never able to mine that replacement transaction!\r\n\r\nIn short, I can't think of any justification for this behavior, as I do not believe it helps accomplish any goal (even goals I do not share).  Of course, this is non-consensus code and all network participants can do what they like with regard to mempool policy without breaking the network.  But that brings me to my next point:\r\n\r\n(b) Wallet users today expect that BIP 125 is largely supported, and we should encourage this.  BIP 125 struck a balance between satisfying part of the community that (however misguided) wanted to preserve how they understood transaction relay to work in the past.  Today I believe that users generally expect that BIP 125 transaction replacements should relay well on the network, and that this does not harm non-BIP-125 users.  We should not go out of our way to make it easy for users to do something that we think is bad for the network and harmful to others.\r\n\r\nI made the point above that a miner opposed to BIP 125 might realistically want to censor BIP-125 signaling transactions.  While that would be something we could not prevent, if someone were to open a PR that implemented such a behavior behind a command-line option that defaulted off, I should hope that everyone would NACK it as incompatible with our project's goals!  I think this `-mempoolreplacement` option is a bit like that, except that it falls so short of accomplishing even a misguided goal that I think we should all be able to agree to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nI don't think this rises to the level that Luke is concerned about, namely a prelude to forcing a common relay policy on all nodes.  In particular I do agree it makes sense that we offer some ways of customizing policy parameters (eg the mempool size, min relay fee, etc).  Instead, I think the justification for this change is that we should not support behaviors we think are harmful to the ecosystem overall and have no legitimate use-case, and we should eliminate ways that users might inadvertently shoot themselves in the foot.",

      "body": "> For non-miners, I do not believe there is any good reason to run with mempool replacement disabled. \r\n\r\nIMO node operators have a right to decide how to interact with the network consistent with the protocol. So they do not need a good reason, or a valid excuse[1] to choose to disable or filter the transactions relayed or mined in some way. IMO we should design and advance the network with this in mind, rather than seek to reduce it.\r\n\r\nBased on that, I think a removal of choice should be justified by the removal solving some significant problem, or enabling some significant benefit, for example @TheBlueMatt mentions \"compact block reconstruction failures\", and \"breaks a lot of modern wallet behavior\". Those could rise to the level of justification that I personally would be happy with, but those justifications should be articulated/evinced rather than just invoked.\r\n\r\n>  a miner opposed to BIP 125 would much more likely want to censor RBF-signaling transactions altogether, rather than just censor their replacements.\r\n\r\nPutting myself in the shoes of this ideological miner, I disagree: disregarding replacements to rbf-signalling transactions is the same as treating them as non-rbf-signalling transactions. That is, you're disregarding the signalled behavior, rather than the transaction itself. An ideological miner / relayer is not opposed to transactions but to the behavior.\r\n\r\n> For miners: of course disabling replacement reduces fee income, so this is a footgun in that a miner using this might be unaware that they are hurting their bottom line by using it\r\n\r\nI don't think being able to opt for incrementally reduced income qualifies as a footgun. A footgun has significant unintended deleterious effects. Incremental loss of income is minor in the scope of things - a reasonable way to address that might be to log warning message.\r\n\r\nIt is also part and parcel with many opinionated miner configurations. If I set up a miner to produce blocks of segwit-only transactions, I am in all likelihood necessarily reducing my fee earnings, but that does not make the choice invalid - the choice is an expression of my prerogative as a node operator. \r\n\r\nThe set of miner configurations which optimize for income is very small, if not singular. Accepting possibly reduced miner income as the basis for removing choice seems to me to be the path @luke-jr alludes to.\r\n\r\n> Wallet users today expect that BIP 125 is largely supported, and we should encourage this.\r\n\r\nIMO setting the default behavior to supported is a substantial and reasonable way to express our support for BIP 125. Beyond that I think it is the node operators' prerogative as to whether BIP 125 is largely supported.\r\n\r\nI think being Bitcoin's reference implementation places a responsibility on the project to accommodate the preferences of node operators wherever the trade-offs allow for it.[2] In a future where we have innumerable node operators operating a global currency on our software, the maximally decentralized and trustless network is not one in which the primary determinant on how the network operates is our own interpretation of user preferences, but rather node operators' preferences as enabled by our software.\r\n\r\n[1] I do not believe we are the arbiters of the validity of their choices.\r\n[2] Again, I would be glad to see a further elaboration on the points originally cited.",

The reverse may be easier for the group, but it seems also a significantly lower level of rigor than I would think necessary to prevent problematic changes over time. IMO burden of proof should be on the one putting the PR forward.\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n> Please describe what wallet behaviour this breaks.\r\n\r\nIMO the claim that a miner was using the configuration in error is not compelling.

But that didn't happen, and it no longer makes much sense to adopt the old behaviour in today's world where most users/miners/nodes work fine with opt-in rbf. Maybe some other behaviour would be worth having as an option, but that needs  to be implemented first. (\"only mine/relay tx's that don't signal opt-in-rbf\" could be worthwhile, but any significant adoption of that seems to me like that'd just make people start using \"full-rbf for everything\" relay/mining policies)",
