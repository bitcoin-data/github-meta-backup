It seems safe to remove this lock ~because it look like it was only added by accident in #11634 to try to satisfy lock annotations, even though it was never really needed to satisfy lock annotations even according to the thread there https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11634/files#r227725517~. (EDIT: lock was not added by accident, it was needed but was always broader than it needed to be and it became unnecessary after a recursive lock was added in #20773)\r\n\r\n⬆️ I think above information would be helpful to add to PR description because otherwise this PR seems like a random change.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, I **think** there are no more cases where `cs_wallet` and `wallets_mutex` are locked at the same time so there is no required lock ordering between them. But in the future, GUI code could do arbitrary things in its `wallet_load_fns` handler, and maybe it will call a wallet function and lock `cs_wallet` in one. In that case the lock order would be `wallets_mutex` first then `cs_wallet` second. It may be good to state some intended lock ordering, maybe adding a code comment to `WalletContext::wallets_mutex` like \"It is unsafe to lock this after locking a `CWallet::cs_wallet` mutex because this could introduce inconsistent lock ordering and cause deadlocks.\"\r\n\r\n> > One concern might be that one of the `wallet_load_fns` callbacks could call a wallet method and acquire cs_wallet mutex _after_ context.wallets_mutex, and maybe this would be in inconsistent order.\r\n> \r\n> Would be bad to lock one `cs_wallet` after `wallets_mutex`?\r\n\r\nIf there is any thread locking `wallets_mutex` after `cs_wallet` then it would be bad, but if not, then it's fine.\r\n\r\n> In master that already happens but works because `cs_wallet` is recursive. Couldn't find more cases of cs_wallet -> wallets_mutex lock order.\r\n\r\nI don't think this matters because recursive locks are no-ops. It a thread locks mutex A, then locks mutex B, then recursively locks mutex A again, then the recursive lock isn't doing anything, and the lock order is still A before B.",

A load handler can always lock `cs_wallet` if needed.\r\n> \r\n> The lock was added in [1c7e25d](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/1c7e25db0c898abc9968ab487b254454b709e628) to satisfy TSAN. With [44c430f](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/44c430ffac940e1d1dd7f5939a495470bc694489) most of the code requiring the lock is in `CWallet::AttachChain`. A comment is added to warn about wallets_mutex and cs_wallet lock ordering.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11634/files#r227725517 is correct, then the lock was not added to satsify TSAN but was added to satisfy clang annotations. I think you could summarize this by saying that this LOCK(cs_wallet) was correctly added in #11634, but it became no longer unnecessary after #20773 when code requiring the lock was moved to the new `AttachChain` method. \r\n\r\nAlso it now seems like the motivation for this change is not just removing an unnecessary lock, but reversing the 1. cs_wallet 2. wallets_mutex lock order so it can now be 1. wallets_mutex 2. cs_wallet, because upcoming GUI PR https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/417 needs this",
