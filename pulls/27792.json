    "body": "This PR is the wallet API and implementation portion of the GUI PR ( https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/733 ) which is an implementation of the ideas in Paul Sztorc's blog post \"**Deniability - Unilateral Transaction Meta-Privacy**\"(https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/).\r\n\r\nThe GUI PR has all the details and screenshots of the GUI additions. Here I'll just copy the relevant context for the wallet API changes:\r\n\r\n\"_In short, Paul's idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\r\nWe've implemented this as an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up to the WalletView class._Â \"\r\n\r\nWhile the Deniability dialog can be implemented entirely with the existing API, adding the core \"deniabilization\" functions to the interfaces::Wallet API allows us to implement the GUI portion with much less code, and more importantly allows us to add RPC support and more thorough unit tests, which is what this PR attempts to do.\r\n\r\nThe main \"deniabilization\" functionality is implemented in spend.cpp/h and feebumper.cpp/h and exposed via the interfaces::Wallet API. \r\nWe've added RPC support via a new RPC call \"walletdeniabilizecoin\". \r\nWe also extended the Wallet tests with coverage for the functionality.\r\n",

      "message": "wallet: Deniability API\n\nThis PR is the wallet API and implementation portion of the GUI PR ( https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/733 ) which is an implementation of the ideas in Paul Sztorc's blog post \"Deniability - Unilateral Transaction Meta-Privacy\"(https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/).\n\nThe GUI PR has all the details and screenshots of the GUI additions. Here I'll just copy the relevant context for the wallet API changes:\n\n\"\nIn short, Paul's idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\nI've implemented this as an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up to the WalletView class.Â \n\"\n\nWhile the Deniability dialog can be implemented entirely with the existing API, adding the core \"deniabilization\" functions to the CWallet and interfaces::Wallet API allows us to implement the GUI portion with much less code, and more importantly allows us to add RPC support and more thorough unit tests.",

Bitcoin Core's wallet has a \"unique\" fingerprint on transactions that is shared by way less than 50% of transactions in the network, so creating additional transactions where it is likely (latest when the outputs are spent) that it was a self-transfer seems only to be bloating the utxo set and chain space? I haven't thought about this, but it would be good to have a more in-depth analysis of this, considering using a different \"fingerprint vector\".",

It's just cumbersome and error prone.\r\n\r\nThe API we're adding in this PR makes this a simple and robust single operation (C++ API call or RPC call).\r\nIt's entirely opt-in and the user can decide to use it or not, up to their own judgement on how effective it is in improving their privacy. I would assume anyone using the C++/RPC interface understands the implications and can be trusted to know what they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe GUI PR (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/733) implements automation on top of this API, which is also entirely opt-in. We provide an explanation of how it works, so the user could make an educated decision on whether to use it or not. \r\nA lot of new Bitcoin users (myself including), weren't aware early on that it's important to use new addresses when receiving BTC. Many exchanges also don't make it easy either (eg by requiring time-locked whitelisting etc).\r\nAs a result I suspect many users may wish to improve their privacy by \"deniabilizing\" their UTXOs after the fact.\r\nThis has been my main motivation to pursue creating this tool. I personally wanted to use it and I suspected others may appreciate it too. ",
