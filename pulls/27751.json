Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.

(#26265)\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The scanblocks RPC returns the relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors by\n+  scanning all blockfilters in the given range. It can be used in combination with\n+  the getblockheader and rescanblockchain RPCs to achieve fast wallet rescans. Note\n+  that this functionality can only be used if a compact block filter index\n+  (-blockfilterindex=1) has been constructed by the node.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- Transactions of non-witness size 65 and above are now allowed by mempool\n+  and relay policy. This is to better reflect the actual afforded protections\n+  against CVE-2017-12842 and open up additional use-cases of smaller transaction sizes. (#26265)\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The scanblocks RPC returns the relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors by\n+  scanning all blockfilters in the given range. It can be used in combination with\n+  the getblockheader and rescanblockchain RPCs to achieve fast wallet rescans. Note\n+  that this functionality can only be used if a compact block filter index\n+  (-blockfilterindex=1) has been constructed by the node. (#23549)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- All JSON-RPC methods accept a new [named\n+  parameter](JSON-RPC-interface.md#parameter-passing) called `args` that can\n+  contain positional parameter values. This is a convenience to allow some\n+  parameter values to be passed by name without having to name every value. The\n+  python test framework and `bitcoin-cli` tool both take advantage of this, so\n+  for example:\n+\n+```sh\n+bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=mywallet load_on_startup=1\n+```\n+\n+Can now be shortened to:\n+\n+```sh\n+bitcoin-cli -named createwallet mywallet load_on_startup=1\n+```\n+\n+- The `verifychain` RPC will now return `false` if the checks didn't fail,\n+  but couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level. This could be due\n+  to missing data while pruning, due to an insufficient dbcache or due to\n+  the node being shutdown before the call could finish.

This is to better reflect the actual afforded protections\n+  against CVE-2017-12842 and open up additional use-cases of smaller transaction sizes. (#26265)\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The scanblocks RPC returns the relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors by\n+  scanning all blockfilters in the given range. It can be used in combination with\n+  the getblockheader and rescanblockchain RPCs to achieve fast wallet rescans. Note\n+  that this functionality can only be used if a compact block filter index\n+  (-blockfilterindex=1) has been constructed by the node. (#23549)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- All JSON-RPC methods accept a new [named\n+  parameter](JSON-RPC-interface.md#parameter-passing) called `args` that can\n+  contain positional parameter values. This is a convenience to allow some\n+  parameter values to be passed by name without having to name every value. The\n+  python test framework and `bitcoin-cli` tool both take advantage of this, so\n+  for example:\n+\n+```sh\n+bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=mywallet load_on_startup=1\n+```\n+\n+Can now be shortened to:\n+\n+```sh\n+bitcoin-cli -named createwallet mywallet load_on_startup=1\n+```\n+\n+- The `verifychain` RPC will now return `false` if the checks didn't fail,\n+  but couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level. This could be due\n+  to missing data while pruning, due to an insufficient dbcache or due to\n+  the node being shutdown before the call could finish. (#25574)\n+\n+- `sendrawtransaction` has a new, optional argument, `maxburnamount` with a default value of `0`.\n+  Any transaction containing an unspendable output with a value greater than `maxburnamount` will\n+  not be submitted. At present, the outputs deemed unspendable are those with scripts that begin\n+  with an `OP_RETURN` code (known as 'datacarriers'), scripts that exceed the maximum script size,\n+  and scripts that contain invalid opcodes.",
