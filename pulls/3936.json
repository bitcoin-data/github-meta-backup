This commit resolves these errors by building Boost from source.\nBuilding from HEAD removes the guarantee of a repeatable build, but this\nappears to be a necessity until the next version of Boost is released.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the [current version of Boost is 1.55.0](http://www.boost.org/users/history). \nPresumably, the next release will include the changes now on HEAD, and once\nthat new version has been [made available in Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/boost.rb), this commit should\nbe reverted.\n",

This commit resolves these errors by building Boost from\nsource. Building from HEAD removes the guarantee of a repeatable build,\nbut this appears to be a necessity until the next version of Boost is\nreleased.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the current version of Boost is 1.55.0 [2].\nPresumably, the next release will include the changes now on HEAD, and\nonce that new version has been made available in Homebrew [3], this\ncommit should be reverted.\n\n[1]: https://gist.github.com/9704573\n[2]: http://www.boost.org/users/history\n[3]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/boost.rb",

      "body": "I'm retracting this pull request by closing it. As it turns out, this entire episode was a case of particularly bad timing on my part.\n\nI followed the `brew install` instructions in `doc/build-osx.md` when the current version of the boost formula in Homebrew was 1.55.0.\n\nAt this point, `make` was failing as described above. I reached out to #bitcoin-dev and got advice to build Boost from source, which I did, and was subsequently able to successfully build. It's at this point that I put together this pull request.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that in the meantime—literally between the time that ran the first failing `make` and the time I issued this pull request—the Homebrew team had merged a new forumla for Boost (1.55.0_1) that fixes the compilation errors I was experiencing (!). (Note that while commit for that version bump was merged 4 days ago, the actual 1.55.0_1 artifact showed up in Homebrew's [distribution directory](http://sourceforge.net/projects/machomebrew/files) only ~9 hours ago). \n\nFor reference, the Homebrew pull request that bumps Boost to 1.55.0_1 is Homebrew/homebrew#27660. Specifically, see comment https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/27660#issuecomment-37923669, which further links to the underlying issue that caused this breakage in the first place.\n\nSo, as it turns out, my compiling from HEAD worked, but only because it was getting me the same fixed that was shipped in 1.55.0_1.\n\nThanks @laanwj for asking me to take a second look at this.\n",
