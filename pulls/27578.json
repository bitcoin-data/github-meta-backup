This is a problem and will eventually cause a mempool divergence between nodes and miners. To help mitigate this we should have an option for users to accept non standard transactions on mainnet. There is already a setting for test networks, this PR just allows it to be set for mainnet.",

Generally speaking, our policy rules are designed to prevent various kinds of denial-of-service attacks, or to help make sure the network runs smoothly -- so if users are trying to bypass them, there's a good chance that there's insufficient understanding of why rules are in place (or possibly the rules are more restrictive than they need to be).\r\n\r\nMoreover, while running with different policies is not something that we can prevent on the network, we should be mindful that if the prevailing network policy is different than what a use case needs, that the use case will likely not be met anyway without some sort of preferential peering with other nodes running the same policy.  So this approach strikes me as insufficient to even achieve the goal it is aiming for.",

      "body": "> If there's a standardness rule that is interfering with someone's use case, we should discuss it and figure out whether the rule can be relaxed to accommodate the use case, or whether the use case can be adapted to comply with the standardness rules. Generally speaking, our policy rules are designed to prevent various kinds of denial-of-service attacks, or to help make sure the network runs smoothly -- so if users are trying to bypass them, there's a good chance that there's insufficient understanding of why rules are in place (or possibly the rules are more restrictive than they need to be).\r\n\r\nI think it is kinda ridiculous to have to come and try and lobby bitcoin core to relay their transaction. This is just a waste of everyone's time on both sides and accomplishes nothing. If people want to accept non standard transactions, we should let them. \r\n\r\nBitcoin core moves extremely slow (for good reason) and application devs move much faster (also for good reason), there will always be a contention here and giving application devs tools to not have to interfere with bitcoin core's process should be the goal. If someone builds something but then needs to convince bitcoin core to allow it to be relayed, then create a patch and get it code reviewed, then finally merged and wait for a release, it will be months to years before their transaction can be relayed. In that amount of time they will have just built a relationship with mining pools and circumvented the mempool completely, and everyone will be worse off for it. And this is happening today! Allowing a flag like this provides a solution so nodes and users can opt into supporting different use cases that haven't yet made it through the process of becoming a standard transaction.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, while running with different policies is not something that we can prevent on the network, we should be mindful that if the prevailing network policy is different than what a use case needs, that the use case will likely not be met anyway without some sort of preferential peering with other nodes running the same policy. So this approach strikes me as insufficient to even achieve the goal it is aiming for.\r\n\r\nYes, this isn't the 100% perfect solution because there is no perfect solution, but this is an extremely simple change that is a step in the right direction.\r\n",

      "body": "Concept NACK. These checks exist for very good reasons; being able to bypass them on mainnet is a huge footgun. If there is a specific standardness rule that you can show (1) provides little utility to the node or network and (2) is getting in the way of a use case, we can discuss changing that rule.\r\n\r\n> There are many projects today that have part of their workflow \"email a miner this transaction\" (inscriptions, https://github.com/supertestnet/breaker-of-jpegs, etc). This is a problem and will eventually cause a mempool divergence between nodes and miners.\r\n\r\nAllowing nonstandard transactions will not help with this case; you still need to find a miner accepting nonstandard transactions to peer with. You are still \"emailing a miner this transaction,\" just in a more roundabout way.\r\n\r\nLet's say, for example, an application is creating transactions with lots of gigantic, nonstandard outputs that everyone needs to store in their UTXO set. If that application caused the UTXO set to 10x in size, making it less feasible to run a lightweight full node, we would then open an issue to Bitcoin Core asking \"why the hell did you help the network relay those transactions?\" It isn't that the \"process is too slow\" to change the standardness rule. It would just be a terrible idea.\r\n\r\n> Yes, this isn't the 100% perfect solution because there is no perfect solution, but this is an extremely simple change that is a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThis \"simple change\" throws the baby out with the bathwater. The perfect solution is to write applications that don't DoS the network.\r\n\r\n> The problem is that standardness is an overloaded term, it contains some DoS protection while also just disallowing other things. As well, sometimes DoS protection also ends up being the cure that's worse than the disease creating things like transaction pinning.\r\n\r\nAgain can you please point to a specific example that you want to change? Otherwise this PR is just saying \"standardness in general is unnecessary,\" and that is incorrect.",

      "body": "It seems inevitable to me that well-coordinated \"third party\" mempools will emerge which eschew all policy and use out-of-band payment as the only means of DoS resistance. Seems likely these sources will be paid attention by large mining pools. I'm sympathetic to the motivations behind this change on those grounds, as well as with the general frustration around the sharp edges of policy (e.g. pinning).\r\n\r\nThe notion of having to lobby a council, however qualified, to \"accept a usecase\" is also understandably unappealing at face value. I think the contributors on this project who work on mempool/p2p would argue that the existing standardness/policy helps the project serve its widely understood goal of being a value/payment system rather than a carrier for arbitrary data payloads - but of course the approach towards this goal can become controversial.\r\n\r\nIt is maybe worth clarifying that this change wouldn't really affect pinning either way, since replacement/ancestry-limiting policy isn't governed by the `-acceptnonstdtxn` flag.\r\n\r\nI'm curious to see how the wider scope of this situation unfolds beyond this issue, because there are many good and conflicting lines of thinking. Being choosy about the nature and topology of transactions that this software broadcasts keeps many (most?) users with a functioning node, but it also drives other users to build consensus-compatible alternatives. The mix there can be hard to observe.\r\n\r\nCoexistence of heterogeneous mempools is maybe the steady state.",

I also believe that policy has room for improvement and we should change rules if they are harmful and unhelpful. Miners accepting out-of-band nonstandard transactions can be a symptom of Bitcoin Core's rules not being accommodating enough. (fwiw it can also mean that people are doing kind of spammy things).\r\n\r\nHowever, I haven't seen any proposals to change specific standardness rules! Why? I hope it doesn't stem from this myth that Bitcoin Core cannot move fast enough to fix things that are truly broken; it is untrue. I hope that you and other application devs feel comfortable proposing and discussing changes, even if they are not always accepted.",

That’s good news! If that’s the case, would it be reasonable to consider removing the 400kb standardness rule (only for taproot transactions)?\r\n\r\nI know for a fact that people are now pushing >400kb txs fairly routinely via out-of-band methods, and I think it would’ve been healthier to the network if they didn’t have to. I’m not sure what’s the best place to propose this but happy to look into it if there isn’t an obvious reason why this shouldn’t be done.",

Otherwise they have to modify and rebuild bitcoin core, and since we know they’re doing this, perhaps it’s better to provide a flag so they can do so safely.",

Any concerted efforts at homogenizing them across all nodes can only be understood as unwarranted overreach by bad actors.\r\n\r\nThis is inaccurate - there are a whole host of issues across the stack with large mempool divergence. From compact block relay losing their efficiency, to feerate estimates getting thrown off, to transaction validation caches becoming less efficient leading to block validation time increases, etc, etc.\r\n\r\nSome mempool divergence is unavoidable - we have to draw lines in the sand *somewhere* to avoid DoS issues, and each of those lines is an avenue for mempool divergence to occur, but that doesn't mean that mempool divergence is good, rather the opposite - those lines have to be drawn to limit mempool divergence where at all possible.",

But if a restriction can be lifted safely and benefit a specific group of users, why not?\r\n\r\nOne use case for a regular user is to gain the ability to insert out of band transactions into their mempool for proper fee estimation. Miners also mine transactions received out-of-band. This would reduce mempool divergence across the network.\r\n\r\nCreated https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27768",
