    "body": "With #24118 introducing sweep functionality, there is no reason to maintain the SubtractFeeFromOutputs (SFFO) behavior as its use case was to do sweeping. So it is now deprecated and usage of it via the RPC will require `-deprecatedrpc=sffo`. The functionality has also been removed from the GUI. The tests have been updated to either use sweep, not use SFFO, or have `-deprecatedrpc=sffo` as necessary.\r\n\r\nThere will be a followup which removes SFFO entirely.\r\n\r\nThere is also a change to `IsDeprecatedRPCEnabled` as there were linker errors for `bitcoin-wallet` with the normal way that it is used.\r\n\r\nRequired #24118.",

      "message": "Add sweep RPC for wallet\n\nCurrently, the wallet uses a fSubtractFeeAmount flag on the recipients\nobjects for all forms of sending calls. The flag was presumably\nintroduced to permit sweeping without manually calculating the fees of\ntransactions.  However, the flag leads to unintuitive behavior and makes\nit more complicated to test exhaustively many wallet RPCs. I'm proposing\nto introduce a dedicated sweep RPC which provides an avenue to easily\nempty wallets as a stepping stone towards removing the \"subtract from\nrecipient\" option on other wallet RPC.\n\nThe proposed sweep call builds a transaction from the wallet's entire\nUTXO pool and assigns the funds to one or more recipients. Recipients\ncan either be specified to receive a given amount or receive an equal\nshare of the remaining unassigned funds. At least one recipient must be\nprovided without assigned amount to collect the remainder. The call has\na sendmax option that changes the default behavior of spending all UTXOs\n(\"no UTXO left behind\"), to maximizing the output amount of the\ntransaction by skipping uneconomic UTXOs.",

You are essentially sweeping a list of specific UTXOs rather than a list of all UTXOs in the wallet. So sweep can be extended to take a list of specific UTXOs and just spend those. That way we don't need to maintain any SFFO logic. It really is not necessary to keep SFFO in coin selection logic if you aren't going to even use the coin selection logic by restricting to a specific set of UTXOs.",

Coin selection is already a multivariate analysis - we have to consider fees, whether a change may be created, the waste metric, etc. There are edge cases when values are near the balance or near dust. All of these things make analyzing coin selection fairly difficult. SFFO is another variable in that analysis, and it can and has caused issues with reasoning about what coin selection is going to do in certain scenarios (while working on #17331, I remember pulling my hair out trying to work out the logic to get SFFO to behave correctly and not interfere with the rest of coin selection). By removing it, we simplify this analysis and thus make it easier to reason about any changes to coin selection logic in the future. Having SFFO has already bitten us in the past, keeping it will surely bite us again in the future. Dealing with SFFO is far more than the extra for loop to reduce the output amounts. It has effects on the actual coin selection logic as it changes what value we use for each input (we use the real value instead of effective value with SFFO on).\r\n\r\nThe second sending function for sweep is very simple and so it is easy to maintain. It does not execute any coin selection logic at all - all UTXOs will be selected, no need to execute any algorithms to figure that out. While adding a second function is certainly a maintenance burden, removing SFFO is a much more significant reduction in maintenance that I am okay with the tradeoff.\r\n\r\n> In any case, it doesn't seem great if the main justification for the UI change is a vague complaint about code maintenance. \r\n\r\n> If having separate spend and sweep functions actually provides a better UI, that could make sense. But it doesn't seem like UI benefits have been explained anywhere (release notes in #24118 would be a good place to brag about them).\r\n\r\nThe sweep function certainly provides a better UI for sweeping a wallet than SFFO does. Instead of having to lookup the balance, specify the balance in the amount, and then specify output indices for SFFO, sweep is a simple function that does exactly what the name suggests. Furthermore, because sweep does not rely on actual coin selection logic, changes to coin selection logic will not unexpectedly break sweep.\r\n\r\n> What was the previous \"unintuitive behavior\"?\r\n\r\nThere have been a couple of bug reports with using SFFO where it fails unexpectedly or does something weird with the fees (#23026, #10034). There have also been some issues opened where users who specify a value near the balance results in the entire balance being unexpectedly spent (#16100).\r\n\r\n> Why is the new behavior more intuitive? Are there existing workflows broken by the new UI? Are there new workflows enabled by the new UI or simplified by it?\r\n\r\nSweep is unambiguous as to what it is going to do - it is going to spend all of the UTXOs in the wallet and send the amount (minus fees) to the specified address(es). It won't be broken by coin selection logic changes because it always chooses every UTXO.",

      "body": "Great feedback! Thank you for clarifying that. I didn't realize:\r\n\r\n- The reason that sweep() implementation can be simpler than send(subtract_from_outputs=true) is that the sweep() implementation only has to support manual coin selection, while the send implementation also supports automatic coin selection.\r\n\r\n- The reason that sweep() implementation is preferable to users is that it doesn't force them make additional calls to find out their balance().\r\n\r\nI'm still skeptical about some things:\r\n\r\n- It's hard to buy the claim that this is a code simplification and good for maintenance when PR adds and duplicates hundreds of lines of code without removing much. I understand your frustration with #17331, but the previous code was god-awful, and the new code is much better (thanks to your efforts!). And the edge cases have been discussed, debugged, documented, and have good test coverage. So deprecating subtract from outputs at this point almost seems like a revenge-killing. If you want to add a sweep RPC that calls just wraps the send code setting subtract=true, that seems like it would be more straightforward to review, and better for long term maintenance, without a duplicate implementation and different set of tests.\r\n\r\n- I still don't know actual use-cases where subtract from outputs has done something bad or harmful or unexpected. To me seems like a straightforward and useful option and like a **simplifying** concept. In a typical bitcoin transaction, amount received is less than than amount sent due to fees, coin selection, etc. So when you create a transaction you have to decide whether you will fix the receive amount, and let the send amount vary. Or fix the send amount and let the receive amount vary. And \"subtract from outputs\" is toggle for doing that. Any time you don't care about receiver receiving an exact quantity (sending between wallets, depositing to an exchange or other online service) your ~probably~ may want to use this option. It seems unfortunate to me if it goes away. I assume people are using it as part of their existing workflows too, but I guess we will have have to find out about that.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Changed \"probably\" -> \"may.\" In typical case you need to create a change output anyway so using option provides no benefit\r\n",

Advantage because you don't have to sum up coin amounts, but drawback because being forced to specify the amount you are sending when you send is kind of a safety feature.

The conclusion was that SFFO does seem to have a use case outside of sweep, and many contributors do not want to see it go. However many people do use SFFO to sweep, and that would still be better served with a dedicated sweep function.\r\n\r\nSo the current idea is to still introduce sweep, and to direct people to use that instead of SFFO if the intention appears to be sweep. This makes it easier for us to reason about edge cases with values near the balance as SFFO will no longer need to be considered.",
