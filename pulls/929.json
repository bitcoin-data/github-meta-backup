Right now, Bitcoin appeals to libertarians, anarchists, and some other groups. By supporting more languages, Bitcoin extends to people who don't speak English. By supporting non-decimal numbers, Bitcoin can extend to those who use or prefer those numbers too. No modern fiat currency can be used effectively with Tonal, so for those who prefer it, this is a \"killer feature\".\n",

      "body": "decimal vs tonal makes perfect sense in this forum, which is a forum discussing this change, which is a change directly related to decimal vs tonal. To avoid a discussion on decimal vs tonal is to avoid discussing this change, isn't it?\n\nI've read the wikipedia article on tonal, which seems to be the same as hexadecimal, which I am familiar with, having used it on a BBC Micro for a good decade or so. I see why it's useful to use hexadecimal with things such as network masks, as they are already based on base 2. Bitcoin numbers are not, and therefore I see no logic in introducing a new base, based on 16, pi, or any other number when there is already one (base 10) established and in use.\n\nI also don't see why 1 BTC doesn't equal 1 TBC. Why was it decided that 0.0001 TBC = .00000001 BTC? Seems a bit arbitrary to me.\n\nThe problem I have with this change is that it sets a precedent, where the end result is not clear. If we add this, do we then add any other base anyone else fancies adding, and if not, what argument would there be not to? It's clear to me there needs to be a strong reason for this base (and a rationale for why it's fixed 0.0001 to 0.00000001 as suggested) over any other base that could be added in order to avoid an unhealthy precedent.\n",

Usually you do numbers in your mind, where fingers are of no relevance. The human mind does not work well with 5s. This is why almost every unit of measurement humans have naturally come up with have been binary, dozenal, or tonal. The modern metric system (SI/decimal) has only ever been adopted by force, and even to this day has notable resistance under persecution in countries that enforce it (except on the decimal clock and calendar, which most everyone has given up on). Also, note that even when finger-counting is helpful, it's much better suited to tonal since you can do a full digit on each hand (ie, 0 through  (15 deci) on one hand, or up to  (255 deci) on both).\n",

      "body": "Luke, so far this change seems to be based on a number of untruths. The bitcoin wiki article on tonal had a number of inaccuracies, which I have edited to correct. e.g. it's not infinitely divisible, as bitcoins txs have limited decimal places, and it's not easier to use than decimal for most people I know. How many people are going to remember that  1 BTC = 1525.87890625 TBC? It just introduces confusion for no apparent benefit.\n\nTake this article, for example : https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Units   - there are two rows both called Bitcoin, but with different values. It almost seems that this tonal proposal borders on sabotaging bitcoin by introducing such ambiguity. I don't only think it's not a healthy change, but actually an unhealthy one. I can't imagine any exchanges referring to TBCs either as it would mess up all their exchange rates unless the currency being exchanged was in base 16 also.\n\nI'm fairly certain that base 10 has not been \"forced on us by governments\", rather, it's existed as far as history can remember because we have 10 fingers, and it's the most obvious and easiest to use for humans.\n\nYou've still not explained why 1 BTC doesn't equal 1 TBC or why it was decided that it would be 0.0001 TBCs that equals 0.00000001 BTC. This are important considerations, and you seem to be avoiding answering queries about them, and instead basing your arguments on falsehoods. Why?\n",

      "body": "Tonal numbers do support infinite binary division, though Bitcoin does not. This was clear in context, though I have added a note to be explicit about it. Tonal is _objectively_ easier than decimal. Conversion can be, and often is, done approximately: do you remember that 1 centimeter = 0.393700787 inches?\n\nDecimal may not have been forced lately (though it arguably was originally when introduced to Europe in the 10th century), but decimal units - the SI metric system - were and still are forced by governments in every case that they have been adopted. Even once a decimal unit is adopted, people who have adopted it continue to use binary divisions despite their awkwardness in the decimal system (eg, US quarters).\n\nBTC is a decimal multiple unit, not part of the protocol. The protocol is based on a \"satoshi\" unit which is 0.00000001 BTC. When choosing the size of the base TBC unit, the primary consideration was what size would be reasonable in the long run. It makes no sense to define 1 TBC = 55,100 (1 BTC). Given the total 2.1 quintillion raw bitcoin elements and reasonable Earth population in the near future, 1,0000 (65,536 deci) satoshis was the most logical quantity to set the base Tonal unit to. Given Bitcoin's current market valuations, it makes more sense to work in ˢTBC (0.16777216 BTC, or about 0.80 USD).\n\nI didn't answer those questions because they were not asked. None of the arguments put forward are false.\n",

If we choose to change the protocol to more digits, we could divide the value of the base unit by a power of 2, or by a power of 10. You may argue that BTC is not a part of the protocol, and I agree, but it is part of the system: the bitcoin economy is built around the monetary unit BTC, and not TBC (though you're free to create one that does). Given that fact, if the precision is increased, the only viable option seems dividing the base unit it by a power of 10, and this new unit will not be expressible as a finite hexadecimal expansion anymore.\n\nI'm willing to accept that people living and raised in a tonal-only world may have some advantage for counting things over those in a decimal world (though I'm not certain either). Who knows? We don't. It may be your dream, but you have to stay realistic. And in a realistic setting, no I don't believe this is a practical advantage to any significant amount of potential users.\n\nI won't comment anymore on this. NACK\n",
