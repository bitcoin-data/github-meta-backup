A Unit of Test\":\r\n\r\n> Cause if you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n> If you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n> Don't be mad once you see that they remove it\r\n> If you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n> Oh, oh, oh\r\n> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\r\n> Oh, oh, oh\r\n> Oh, oh, oh\r\n> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\r\n> Oh, oh, oh\r\n> Cause if you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n> If you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n> Don't be mad once you see that they remove it\r\n> If you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n\r\nNotes to reviewers:\r\n\r\n* I believe this change to be exhaustive -- no unused methods should be left to discover in the code base (excluding dependencies) after the merge of this PR. Any counter-examples would be very welcome so that I can revisit my methodology!\r\n* Let me know if there are any open PR:s making use of any of these methods, or if there is any compelling evidence that the YAGNI principle does not hold for any of those methods :-)",

      "body": "I'm not sure how I feel about this PR.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of removing code that is untested and unreferenced, since it at risk of bitrotting, or being buggy and unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThat said, I would say that PartiallySignedTransaction::IsNull and CBlock::ToString are both (1) essentially trivial methods with a negligible possibility of error, and (2) seem like they are fulfilling some part of the interface contract of their respective classes.\r\n\r\nFor PST::IsNull, my sense is that by convention we often use value objects as \"nullable\", rather than wrap them in an Option type, if their contents are effectively all nullable. Having some sort of method to test for nullity is part of the contract required to use them in that way. (I feel more strongly about PST than PBSTInput/Output, because the latter are less likely to be useful to code external to the module, and so anybody doing fancy things with them is more likely to feel licensed to modify them to suit.)\r\n\r\nFor CBlock::ToString, it appears to be mainly intended for debugging, and I expect it's the case that many objects have ToString methods intended to fulfill this same sort of \"can be printed for debugging\" contract. I expect this method has been called with useful results in debug printfs that were never checked in, and might be again in the future. (I'm not generally working with CBlock objects, so I'm speculating, but if other nearby objects tend to have ToString methods that _are_ called that would strengthen my case.)\r\n\r\nThe BlockFilter constructor appears to be one among many, and I'm not close enough to that code to have an opinion on whether that specific variant is useful past the removal of whatever was calling it.\r\n\r\nThe comments on CBloomFilter suggest that the tweak is only useful for testing, so the reset method is unlikely to be useful outside the module's own tests, which I think makes it a good candidate for removal (again under the reasoning that anybody who's working with it is probably editing the module itself, and is likely to feel licensed to add it back if they need it.)",

I've argued this before, and I felt exactly the same when seeing this PR title. Sometimes there's an unwritten assumption about what methods to expect on a certain API, and this is broken by ripping them outâjust because they happen to be unused and untested at the moment. The better thing to do would be to add tests.\r\n\r\n(removing things can be argued on a case-by-case basis, obviously, but don't blanket-do this)\r\n\r\nEdit: okay, this PR is not as bad as the title sounds. Still, what I'm personally much more interested in would be \"used, but untested\" methods, because it means they do affect outcomes and need tests.",
