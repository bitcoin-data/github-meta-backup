    "body": "As suggested by sipa in the open issue #4576 (2014) -- \"[discussion] Dealing with assertions and optional consistency checking\" -- as an alternative to `assert(…)` in situations where `assert(…)` is not appropriate:\r\n\r\n> …\r\n> What I want is more of these checks, more as a way for the programmer to say \"this is what I assume here\", more than \"if this doesn't hold here, we're in BIG trouble\". It makes the code clearer, and simultaneously verifies that such assumptions hold. But only in cases where we're not at risk of hurting the network by dying.\r\n> …\r\n\r\n`ASSUME(expression)` works like this:\r\n* If compiled with `-DABORT_ON_FAILED_ASSUME` (set by `--enable-debug` and/or `--enable-fuzz`): Evaluate expression and abort if `expression` is `false`.\r\n* If compiled without `-DABORT_ON_FAILED_ASSUME`: Evaluate `expression` and continue execution.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint main(void) {\r\n    ASSUME(IsFoo());\r\n     ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `!IsFoo()` _and_ `-DABORT_ON_FAILED_ASSUME`, then:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    filename.cpp:123: main: ASSUME(IsFoo()) failed.\r\n    Aborted\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise the execution continues.\r\n\r\nResolves #4576.",

I think asserts and checks are best for succinctly conveying assumptions made by the code author that in no cases should ever be violated, and conveying at a very coarse level how crucial those assumptions are (abort-worthy or not). The main point of asserts and checks should be to make code more readable and communicate how to think about it.\r\n\r\nOnce you're in the realm of conditions that you think should never happen, but are more complicated and might end up happening anyway, you are really better off writing an actual log print with text that would put the error into context. You may also want to abort in these cases, which is why logging frameworks support `FATAL` and `DFATAL` severity levels.",

Let's bikeshed! :)\r\n\r\nNot interested in bikeshedding and this is fine if other reviewers want it, but I'll just point out that as of b1eba5575b53dda9bb7765701d4a6305d07faa74 this PR makes `assert` and `CHECK` mean the exact opposite things they mean in other C++ codebases, where `CHECK` aborts in all builds and `assert` aborts in debug builds only (examples in table above https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16136#issuecomment-501779934).\r\n\r\nA good way to provide more clarity, I think, would be to follow convention used in other libraries and add a pair of `CHECK`/`DCHECK` macros instead of a single macro, avoiding use of any assert. An advantage of doing this is that both macros could do extra things like log to `debug.log` or capture stack traces before aborting, which aren't so easily possible with `assert`.",

I'm trying to say that if you add a macro that aborts and reports errors in debug builds only, it would be good to have a corresponding macro that does the same thing in all builds, and that naming I've seen before for this is CHECK/DCHECK.\r\n\r\nTaking a step back, the only reason I have interest in this PR is that I think current `assert` macro sucks, and that it's be nice to have a better macro that can do things like log to debug.log, capture stack traces, suggest bug reporting, etc.",

      "body": "It's possible I misunderstood part of the intent of this PR, but I don't think the expression should be evaluated in non-debug builds. Few reasons:\r\n\r\n- It would encourage putting code that has external side effects in DCHECK macros, which would make it easier not to notice the effects of invoking code, and be bad for readability.\r\n- It would encourage general misuse of the DCHECK macro. Like I wrote in my earlier comment I think the best use of DCHECK is just to state basic assumptions that code makes so it is more readable, and to help catch simple bugs during development. It shouldn't be used as lazy way to handle errors in release builds and avoid having to write readable error messages that put errors into context.\r\n- It could potentially make release code less efficient.\r\n- It would be inconsistent with other DCHECK implementations. Neither the glog nor folly DCHECK macros have side effects in release builds (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16136#issuecomment-501779934) .\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to rename `ABORT_ON_FAILED_DCHECK` to `ENABLE_DCHECK` and when it's not defined either make `DCHECK` a no-op like folly, or make it compile the condition expression without executing it like glog.",
