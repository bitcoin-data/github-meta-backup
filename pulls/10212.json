      "body": "@practicalswift The comment you referenced is a bit misleading as this Doxygen confusion only occurs with free functions. In fact one of the changes in #10029 was not affected by the issue, `CTxMemPool::UpdateTransactionsFromBloc`, but was changed anyway.\r\n\r\nDoxygen does not get confused on any of the method signatures fixed by this PR; a query for 'BlockConnected' gives us:\r\n\r\n> BlockConnected\r\n> CMainSignals::BlockConnected()\r\n> PeerLogicValidation::BlockConnected()\r\n> ConnectTrace::BlockConnected()\r\n> CValidationInterface::BlockConnected()\r\n> CWallet::BlockConnected()\r\n> CZMQNotificationInterface::BlockConnected()\r\n\r\nIt looks like Doxygen omits the arguments altogether unless you're looking up a free function (function outside of any class).\r\n\r\nYour changes, which @MarcoFalke's was talking about, still behave oddly in Doxygen search, though slightly less so since your fix was applied and the parameter names match,\r\n\r\n> PruneBlockFilesManual\r\n> PruneBlockFilesManual(int nManualPruneHeight): validation.cpp\r\n> PruneBlockFilesManual(int nManualPruneHeight): validation.cpp\r\n\r\nThis behavior has (allegedly) something to do with Doxygen not grouping the functions by namespace and instead grouping by file, though both say .cpp so that doesn't make sense. I don't know exactly what causes this or how to fix it.\r\n\r\nGiven this I don't believe there's a reason to make these changes as there are many more identical issues which we are arbitrarily choosing not to fix. Let me know if you think I missed something, otherwise I'll take a shot at submitting a review.",
