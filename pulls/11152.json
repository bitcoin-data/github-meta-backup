    "body": "I have intentionally avoided touching DEFAULT_ANCESTOR_SIZE_LIMIT to err on the site of caution, but this is something I'd like to see lifted again.\r\n\r\nDue to the ridiculous transaction fees required these days, it's not really economically sane to rely on bitcoin core's wallet for processing deposits and withdrawals. So I have been helping a company come up with a pretty low-tech solution, and have a simple structure:\r\n\r\n* Deposits go into a wallet A\r\n* They are periodically swept to wallet B, with an extremely low fee\r\n* Withdrawals are processed from wallet C. When extra funds are needed, they are immediately sent from wallet B.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever continually sending payments from wallet C, this structure results in very long transaction chains. Even when being responsible and batching in 1 minute sends, it'll very often hit against the current limits which is fun for no one.\r\n\r\nFor a background of why the limit was previously lowered from 100 to 25:\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-October/011401.html",

The mempool being full and/or spammed is not nearly as problematic thanks to a lot of improvements, and not to mention significantly more expensive to do so.  And for safety I've kept DEFAULT_ANCESTOR_SIZE_LIMIT for sanity. And two years ago it was not nearly as needed to chain chain transactions as now. I'm providing a legitimate use case for transaction chaining that was asked for in the original mailing list post.\r\n\r\nFWIW: This isn't even for me. I'm just trying to help a company send transactions in an affordable way, without going down the path of spending thousands of dollars on writing custom coin selection that avoids this limit and can manage large unspent sets properly (like I've had to do). But I strongly feel bitcoin should be trying to minimize the harmful effects of centralization that the high fees have caused. Allowing someone to fire a hundred transactions in a row without having to write extremely complex logic is a marked improvement. \r\n\r\n> A few weeks ago you were asking the that allowed unconfirmed chaining depth be made 0. :(\r\n\r\nWas that _really_ necessary? It's a clever one-liner to try undermine my credibility -- but it's a rather blatant and unfair mischaracterization. I suggested that only in the very specific case of bip125 transactions, for the express purpose of stopping the receiver making it unfeasible for you to fee bump. And as I recall you were against such limits because of their paternalistic nature. ",

The downside to increasing the limits is a slowdown in mempool operations and, specifically, CreateNewBlock.  Quantifying that slowdown should be part of any argument in favor of raising it, along with motivation for miner income going up to compensate for that.\r\n\r\nEven putting aside arguments that a different workflow would make more sense -- from the use case described, it's not clear to me that the chain limits need to be increased in order for the transactions to confirm?  What's the problem with generating the long-chain of transactions and just rebroadcasting them as the ancestors confirm?  That could be done just by using higher local policy limits and/or -walletrejectlongchain=0 (or whatever that command line option is called).",

The main limitation of it is that the site gives txid's that aren't on the network (a little confusing) and the transaction unfortunately has no chance of confirming next block (even though it pays enough) which is a bit unfortunate. There's also a bit of a risk that you continually outpace the network, but that can be solved by just sending in 1 minute batches or so.",

I'm pretty sure it doesn't for nodes, but I didn't check the mining functionality like @sdaftuar mentioned. I was kind of hoping it was just a forgotten about thing that could safely be restored due to all the improvements that have happened in the mean time.\r\n\r\n> Come on now, that is really unfair to me. I am not trying to undermine your credibility.\r\n\r\nI apologize, I should've been more charitable in my reading. I see bip125 as a special case for when you're specifically planning on replacing transactions (e.g. doing what Luke suggested earlier) which would mean that if someone spent from it before it confirmed it would strictly be a nuisance and greatly complicate your code (as well as make you pay to orphan it).\r\n\r\n> I hope you'll provide feedback on efforts to implement that in the wallet.\r\n\r\nAll the batching and replacement stuff is a bit of a nightmare of complexity to manage for an end user. There's just a surprising  amount of cases that can happen, and they can all cost you a lot of money if you ignore them or handle them badly.\r\n\r\nLater this year I'm hoping to release a software bundle to make it sane for businesses to accept/send bitcoin, and a pretty big aspect of it is decoupling \"sends\" with actual bitcoin transactions. And the actual wallet does the logic of bundling in a single transaction (or not), and resending (e.g. monitoring and seeing if a previous transaction got confirmed, and then creating a new transaction for the parts that didn't get sent etc.),\r\n\r\nFrom the end user experience, it really should be \"fire and forget\" and they get some internal identifier to be able to query the current state of things if they're interested\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure how much of that is suitable for a consumer-level wallet though. I'm not sure there's many people who send bitcoin transactions with such a frequency that would justify that sort of thing.",
