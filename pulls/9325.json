I am not sure how it would interfere with relay - can you elaborate?\r\n\r\nI do think the code in this PR could be refined further to give a middle-road between what it currently does and what #9352 does - i.e. fetch blocktxns is they are small or base the size based on how much has already been downloaded.\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"downloading the same block multiple times\", this doesn't happen. i.e. this only causes compact-blocks-sent-as-announcements to be responded to, so the only change is more getblocktxns requests - 3 as a maximum (as this is the limit on compact block announcements we can received). Admittedly I could add code to reduce this to 1 or 2, and that would be my next proposed improvement to this code.\r\n\r\nAlso, ideally we should soon only connect to nodes that can provide compact blocks, so the case where we are downloading a full block AND compact block(s) should no longer occur soon once this change is made, so the worst case scenario with this code will be that we send three getblocktxn requests - and this in my testing so far happens very rarely - most often the first blocktxn received is enough to make the block and this occurs before the 2nd compact block is received. Certainly I have never seen 3 blocktxns requested so far - and like I say, the code could be changed to avoid this.",

      "body": "> I am not sure how it would interfere with relay - can you elaborate?\r\n\r\nThere are too many issues here for me to go through all of them, but I can give you a couple examples of ways an attacker can break this code; hopefully that will provide enough a flavor for how to think about these kinds of changes better.\r\n\r\nFirst example: what happens if high-bandwidth peer A and high-bandwidth peer B are using different algorithms for prefilling their compact blocks?  This is explicitly allowed in BIP 152.  Yet if you receive peer A's cmpctblock, and then send back a GETBLOCKTXN, and then receive peer B's cmpctblock before A send back the BLOCKTXN message, this patch would overwrite the PartiallyDownloadedBlock with information from B, causing A's response to not decode properly.  In this case, peer A might even get banned for sending a BLOCKTXN message with the wrong number of transactions(!).\r\n\r\nAnother example: imagine you have two peers, A and B, controlled by a common attacker.  Peer A and Peer B alternate in sending you cmpctblock messages that don't decode (one easy way to do this would be to just omit the coinbase transaction from the prefilled transaction list; there are other ways to do this as well).  Each time you receive a new cmpctblock message, you switch the download to being from the peer with the latest message, causing the disconnect logic for a stalling peer to not trigger.  This can allow an attacker to blind you to a block (potentially indefinitely). \r\n\r\n> Regarding the \"downloading the same block multiple times\", this doesn't happen. i.e. this only causes compact-blocks-sent-as-announcements to be responded to, so the only change is more getblocktxns requests - 3 as a maximum (as this is the limit on compact block announcements we can received). Admittedly I could add code to reduce this to 1 or 2, and that would be my next proposed improvement to this code.\r\n\r\nThere is logic in the cmpctblock handling code to request a full block in the event that there's a txid collision, so I think more care needs to be taken to ensure that we don't download the block multiple times.  (Note also that the GETBLOCKTXN message can, in the worst case, request all the transactions in the block.)\r\n\r\n",

I realise it can be difficult to spot all the flaws in code without an extra set of eyes, so thank you for lending yours.",
