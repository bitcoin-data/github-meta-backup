    "body": "There is no technical reason to prevent this, though of course, non-signalling transactions are less likely to actually get mined. There is no consensus over the mempool, and especially in times of congestion, a higher fee transaction may be able to replace a lower fee one regardless of fee rate.\r\n\r\nNo changes to the tests were required, as this case is not tested. If `-mempoolfullrbf` (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25353) is enabled, the replacement is of course added to the mempool. If not, the replacement is added to the wallet and may be broadcast later.\r\n\r\nQuestion: What would be the best way to force the transaction to be added to the mempool, with broadcast?",

Thus this should respect the `-mempoolfullrbf` option.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in line with the above principle, we generally don't make changes to the wallet involving relay policy until it is clear that a new policy has been adopted by the network. So this change should wait until `-mempoolfullrbf=1` is the default and has wide enough adoption that such transactions propagate well.\r\n\r\nThis also needs tests for the specific behavior.\r\n\r\n> No changes to the tests were required, as this case is not tested\r\n\r\nCI seems to disagree.",

Thus this should respect the `-mempoolfullrbf` option.\n\nThis isn't a matter of \"respect\": BIP 125 isn't a contract. We have a transaction that we would like to get mined that isn't getting mined. A fee bump is improving our chances.\n\n>Additionally, in line with the above principle, we generally don't make changes to the wallet involving relay policy until it is clear that a new policy has been adopted by the network. So this change should wait until `-mempoolfullrbf=1` is the default and has wide enough adoption that such transactions propagate well.\n\nBut this isn't really a question of relay policy: the fee bumped transaction is perfectly valid, and some nodes will propagate it.\n\nThe most likely scenario where this is relevant is congestion. In that scenario the minimum relay fee rate is not going to be the same on all nodes. So your fee bumped transaction genuinely has a higher chance of getting mined. Indeed, your own node may not be accepting the original to the mempool due to a higher than default relay fee. \n\n>This also needs tests for the specific behavior.\n>\n>> No changes to the tests were required, as this case is not tested\n>\n>CI seems to disagree.\n\nFWIW I ran `make check` as the docs suggested.

And of course, privacy leaks can be mitigated by occasionally accepting full-rnf replacements.\n\n>> The most likely scenario where this is relevant is congestion. In that scenario the minimum relay fee rate is not going to be the same on all nodes. So your fee bumped transaction genuinely has a higher chance of getting mined. Indeed, your own node may not be accepting the original to the mempool due to a higher than default relay fee.\n>\n>In that scenario, we should be checking the conditions for whether a transaction can be abandoned before allowing fee bumping. In such a situation, the same effect can be achieved by abandoning the transaction and recreating it.\n\nThere is no safe way of recreating a transaction from the user's perspective. The correct thing to do is to feebump to ensure that the recipient isn't paid twice.\n\nCongestion is a transient condition. Not permanent.\n\nIndeed, abandontransaction is a very dangerous RPC call that can easily result in lost money. We should have added a true cancel transaction instead that double spent to avoid a double payment.\n",

A user might have sent a transaction without RBF, not know about the -mempoolfullrbf setting and then naively call bumpfee. The result would be thoroughly confusing.\r\n\r\nI tried this today on signet. It wasn't confusing for me because Tx1 got mined soon and Tx2 was marked as conflicted.\r\n\r\n> Enabling this ability for users who manually turned on mempoolfullrbf=1 is fine with me, though the documentation should warn that the transaction will only propagate to peers that also have this enabled (i.e. it's an advanced feature).\r\n\r\nAgreed. Tested this as well by running 2 signet nodes and replacing Tx1 with Tx2 on one. It was relayed to the peer I added manually but not visible in explorers as they might not be running nodes with `mempoolfullrbf=1`. Tx1 was mined in a few minutes so I am assuming none of my automatic outbound connections and signet miners (@ajtowns  and @kallewoof) are using full rbf.",
