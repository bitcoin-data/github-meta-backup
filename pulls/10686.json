Adding superfluous initialization can conceal real bugs when it prevents valgrind and MSAN from seeing code accessing uninitialized memory because it's been filled with dummy data.  This isn't a hypothetical concern-- I've both seen errors caught this way, and real errors hidden by excess initialization.\r\n\r\nIf the initialization the appropriate initial state, then by all means... but if any use of the initialized value would be a program error then it probably should not be initialized.\r\n",
