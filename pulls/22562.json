    "body": "This brings the entirety of netaddress.h into styling compliance\r\nwith regard to the indentation of `public`/`private`/`protected`\r\nclass blocks, per the styling guidelines.\r\n\r\nAs outlined in the developer documentation, there should be\r\nno indentation for `public`/`private`/`protected` class blocks,\r\nand this file currently has a \"mixed-usage\" of indentation vs\r\nnon-indentation in this regard. This PR serves to bring the file\r\ninto uniform compliance with the standing guidelines, which\r\nshould prevent/ease further confusion.\r\n\r\nThis is a whitespace-only PR, as can be verified by enabling\r\nthe \"Hide whitespace changes\" option in GitHub's WebUI;\r\nnet 0/0 additions/deletions.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI know blanket refactors such as this are generally\r\ndiscouraged, but seeing as there is little current activity with\r\nthis file at the moment, and that it is bringing it into styling\r\ncompliance, I feel it is appropriate/justified if for nothing else\r\nthan squashing a discrepancy in the existing code styling\r\nthat is in direct contradiction to the stated guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: I have specifically ignored the pointer/reference side portion\r\nof clang-format here specifically to make this a whitespace-only\r\nchange-set. As such, anyone running the `clang-format-diff.py`\r\nscript manually against this commit will see further changes that\r\nare intentionally omitted here, but could be added if deemed\r\nappropriate.\r\n",

While this is probably a good rule for incorrect style in a single line, if a whole block is wrongly indented (e.g. 3 spaces vs 4 spaces), it makes editing that block harder because your editor might re-indent the whole block and you'd have to manually adjust the diff afterward to restore the incorrect indentation.

However, we're now trying to converge to\r\na single style, which is specified below. When writing patches, favor the new\r\nstyle over attempting to mimic the surrounding style, except for move-only\r\ncommits.\r\n> \r\n> Do not submit patches solely to modify the style of existing code.\r\n\r\n\r\n> as this was not a \"random\" reformat,\r\n\r\nYes, sorry, \"random\" might be the wrong word. I just mean it comes out of the blue, it's not a section of the code you've been working on.\r\n\r\n> Sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nNo problem, thanks for trying to contribute!",
