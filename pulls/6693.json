      "body": "No I'm not referring to a security issue, just functional and\nperformance related.\n\nWhat is happening is that the nodes are getting hung when large numbers\nof blocks are getting downloaded.  I see this clearly when running the\nwallet.py test and it happens 50% of the time I run that test.   I've\nverified this on both win32 and win64 workstations.   What is seen is\nthat at some point the client sends a getdata but the other node never\nreceives the request and it always happens when a large number of blocks\nhas to sync (such as mining 100 blocks during the wallet.py test).  That\nby itself could be a number of things, and I've run down quite a few\nrabbit trails to no avail, but when I then increase the buffer size the\nproblem goes away.  I wish I could see the traffic in the network\nsniffer but on Windows we can't monitor the loopback adapter with\nWireShark.   So I think it's a logical deduction that the buffer is\ngetting full. \n\nThe bigger problem though in my mind is that send buffers should not be\ngetting full to begin with.  There should be some handling in the code\nto check the buffer has room before data is sent down the pipe to\nprevent hangups, but I don't know the code base yet well enough to see\nif that is already being done and just not working properly, or whether\nit needs to be added.\n\nRegardless, the default 8KB Windows socket buffer is far too small (I\nreally don't understand why they still have kept it that low, I think\nsince windows 95).  Mac has a 64KB buffer default and I would expect\nLinux probably does also.  The bigger the buffer the more throughput is\npossible and hence better performance: Throughput = Buffersize/latency. \n\nOn 18/09/2015 8:09 AM, Wladimir J. van der Laan wrote:\n\n> Is this a security issue?\n> \n> I don't really know windows networking internals, but in which\n> circumstances can a client flood this buffer?

      "body": "@laanwj I agree that this may be covering up a deeper functional issue, but if there's an issue there, it's been there for a long time and likely for all platforms.  I don't really see any risk here in raising the buffer to a more reasonable size for Native Windows which OSX  and Linux already use as defaults.  IMO it really needs to be done anyway, deeper issues aside.\n\nAnd at the least, buffers size fixes issue 6554, and will likely improve sync times for windows users, and in addition, we finally get the all the python tests working on Windows and therefore (hopefully) on Travis as well.\n\nAs a side note, and as far as security goes, there's really nothing an attacker can do with this change that they can't already do.\n\nPeter\n",

If it's not completely full, small writes should continue to succeed. @ptschip Could you please add some logging so that nErr is always printed if the send() fails?

So using 8KB send, 8KB Receive, the test fails,  using 8KB send, 16KB receive the test also fails, using 8KB send and 64KB receive, the test passes.  It seems more likely the problem is on the receiving end, also noting that when the test fails a getdata is sent and a log entry made, but never received at the other end.  After reviewing the code I also don't see anything in the send data code that is cause for alarm. However, I'll still add the logprint entries and see if anything comes out of it.  But really it's starting to look like just poorly sized buffers, \n",

      "body": "@theuni Cory, I did a couple of things (see below), neither of which worked.  The same problem persists.  Only when the receive buffer is changed to 64KB does the problem go away and the test pass.  I'm wondering if there is a problem with how truncated data is handled on the receiving end , as would happen with a  receive buffer overflow?\n\n1)  disabled optimistic sending.  No change in the test.  We still fail at exactly the same place.\n\n2) made the send socket a blocking socket, which according to Microsoft would fix the issue of a delayed ACK. So, delayed ACKing is not the cause of the problem.\n\nMethod 1: Use Blocking Sockets\nThis problem only occurs with non-blocking sockets. When you use a blocking socket, this problem does not occur because Afd.sys handles the socket buffer differently. For more information about blocking and non-blocking socket programming, see the Microsoft Platform SDK documentation.\n",

      "body": "@ptschip Ok, no worries. Good luck with the move.\n\nHere's another one to try when you get a chance. Here's the theory:\n\nWe may end up in a state where we have received lots of getdatas but not yet processed them all. The message handler and socket handler both grab the recv lock via TRY_LOCK, though it will obviously take the message handler longer to process the message than it takes to grab it from the socket. So it's likely that the socket handler will fail to grab the lock much more often.\n\nDuring that time, the receive buffer will fill up because we're not actively draining it. If it gets too full, we may start failing to send() on the other end. Increasing the receive buffer would alleviate some pressure, but it wouldn't be addressing the real issue.\n\nThat's consistent with a \"fix\" of raising the receive buffer size, while also explaining the send errors.\n\nHere's a patch to test that theory.

      "body": "@theuni   Cory, here's yet another bit of code that fixes or masks the issue, we don't really need to be sleeping if we've just sent messages, rather we should be checking the receive queue for anything that's been coming back.  So now we have 3 different code changes, all performance enhancements, which on their own I think would be beneficial but none of them gets to the root of the problem.\n- g_signals.SendMessages(pnode, pnode == pnodeTrickle || pnode->fWhitelisted);\n- if(g_signals.SendMessages(pnode, pnode == pnodeTrickle || pnode->fWhitelisted))\n-       fSleep = false;\n\nOne other thing I found today, which may be just another rabbit trail, but may also be nearer to the root of the problem is that we seem to be receiving a great many blocks that we've never requested!  In the logs of the nodes that fail to sync I see this pattern:\n\n137 blocks requested\n185 blocks downloaded\n203 blocks are actually in the database however when we RPC them we only see 119.\n\nSo it appears that all blocks \"have\" been downloaded and sync'd somehow, but are not showing up in the logs as downloaded and they can't be counted by RPC'ing and getting a block count.  And now that I think of it that was one of the original observations at the beginning of the issue 6554 thread.  \n\nI'll keep digging...\n",

      "body": "@ptschip Thanks for continuing to dig.\n\nYour change (if I'm reading it right) is to set fSleep to false if SendMessages returns true? SendMessages always returns true :)\n\nSo you're effectively disabling the sleep. I bet you'd find that the cpu load is pegged on one core. That does work to strengthen my locking theory, though.\n\nPlease try building from this branch: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/tree/net-lock-hacking\n\nIt's a hack, but it should be enough to test my theory. This drops the node's receive lock while it processes messages. The result should be that it races through the messagehandler much quicker.\n",

      "body": "@theuni Cory,  I got around to testing your \"net-lock-hacking\" code and the results are pretty good.\n\nTested again on a Windows 7 with a wireless high speed connection (not over the internet)...syncing a 600MB blockchain, 3 tests each and average taken.\n\nCurrent Master Build with 8KB tcp send buffer, 8KB receive buffer:   236 seconds to sync\nCory's net lock code with 8KB tcp send buffer and 8KB receive buffer:  194 seconds to sync.\n\nAlmost an 18% improvement.  Even so, we're still only using about 1/3 of the network bandwidth...there's clearly more improvement possible to increase throughput.  Judging from the logs there is a about 50 seconds of just verifying blocks, not sure much can be done about that, but there should be another 40 or 50 seconds to save somewhere to get bandwidth utilization up to 60 or 70%.\n\nAnyway, I thought you'd like to know the results...great stuff.\n\nI'm still looking at the buffersizes and going to run some tests tomorrow.  After your code changes and the low latency of my network I'm not seeing much difference in terms of tcp buffer sizes helping performance. I'm going try test form a  separate internet connection to see what happens when there's more latency on the wire. \n",
