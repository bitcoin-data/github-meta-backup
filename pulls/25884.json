Onion connections are anonymous, so the attacker can't easily (hopefully not at all) distinguish users.\r\nTherefore, this is much easier to spot as an attack and it can't be directed efficiently against one single peer.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, clearnet, as much as:\r\n\r\n> It's also alleviated with IPv4/IPv6 connections (especially when using the `-asmap`\r\n  configuration option) due to the cost of obtaining IPs in many networks.\r\n\r\nappears to me much more vulnerable to targeted attack (your IP address can make you a sitting duck.), which are much harder to spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this ignored because it's considered an irrelevant distinction, or are there other reasons?\r\nTo be clear, I agree with the warnings added in this PR, I'm just curious as to why the arguments above are not considered/expressed.",

      "body": "> Or should we just mention the sybil risk in each doc?\r\n\r\nYeah. That is an option, with the obvious drawback of having 3 copies of the text and that each change has to be applied to 3 places. That is strictly \"no-no\" for source code, less I guess, for documentation.\r\n\r\n> What else would be placed in the security doc?\r\n\r\nI do not know. If the common text is just for Sybil, then maybe `doc/sybil.md` and refer it from here?\r\n\r\n> For example, would https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25883 be placed there\r\n\r\nI don't think so. The config also applies to other aspects (e.g. wallet), not just \"network security\".",
