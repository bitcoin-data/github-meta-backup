    "body": "Fix a very longstanding bug wherein the txindex LevelDB was not being closed properly when stopping bitcoind,\r\nwhich is done by leveldb::DB::~DB(), ie., you need to call delete once for every DB* you create.\r\nThis was causing the txindexing progress to have fallen behind to its last random checkpoint the next time\r\nbitcoind was started.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

Good thing i always write everything in a text editor because I'm so used to Android killing my apps and taking my drafts with them i dont like any ux that just deletes what you were working on because you hit one button. People accidentally hit buttons all the time. Anyway back on subject:\r\n\r\nAh yes, was just able to verify that this patch does not in fact mysteriously fix the issue, so it remains mysterious at the moment.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is, if you interrupt bitcoind in the middle of a sync with txindex on, the next time you run it, the txindexer has suddenly seemed to have fallen many blocks behind where it was when you interrupted the first process, for whatever reason that is yet to be determined, but the chainstate is always properly synced and closed so there must be a hint in comparing how the two are used differently.\r\n\r\n So, when the txindex thread restarts it wastes a bunch of time indexing blocks it has already indexed, which you can tell because no new data is written to the leveldb until it catches back up since the keys and values in the txindex don't change. Will file a bug report if i can't find an existing one. \r\n \r\nI haven't seen any crashes or anything worse than wasting some time and disk i/o, so it's not a real big deal in the grand scheme of the txindexer's overall time, just slows down syncing when you do restart it until the indexer catches back up, so if you're frequently stopping and starting the sync like because you have a magnetic spinning disk and it's your only disk, it can get a little irritating. But then that's always irritating 😂 thanks for the info\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@paulyc Oh, thank you, very nice catch. This is happening because the txindex (and the other indices) are stopped in `Shutdown` (init.cpp) before `ForceFlushStateToDisk` is called. `ForceFlushStateToDisk` triggers the `ChainStateFlushed` callback on the indices which commits the indexed state to disk. So probably the best solution is to move the index stops after that. Alternately, `BaseIndex::Stop` can just call `Commit` directly. Or do both, because I don't see a downside to either approach.",

Will file a bug report if i can't find an existing one. \r\n \r\nI haven't seen any crashes or anything worse than wasting some time and disk i/o, so it's not a real big deal in the grand scheme of the txindexer's overall time, just slows down syncing when you do restart it until the indexer catches back up, so if you're frequently stopping and starting the sync like because you have a magnetic spinning disk and it's your only disk, it can get a little irritating. But then that's always irritating 😂 thanks for the info",
