    "body": "Address #27380 (and similar future issues) by handling failed `assert_equal()` assertions in bcc callback functions   \r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nExceptions are not propagated in ctype callback functions used by bcc. This means an AssertionError exception raised by `assert_equal()` to signal a failed assertion is not getting caught and properly logged. Instead, the error is logged to stdout and execution of the callback stops.\r\n\r\nThe current workaround to check whether all `assert_equal()` assertions in a callback succeeded is to increment a success counter after the assertions (which only gets incremented if none exception is raised and stops execution). Then, outside the callback, the success counter can be used to check whether a callback executed successfully.\r\n\r\nOne issue with the described workaround is that when an exception occurs, there is no way of telling which of the `assert_equal()` statements caused the exception; moreover, there is no way of inspecting how the pieces of data that got compared in `assert_equal()` differed (often a crucial clue when debugging what went wrong).\r\n\r\nThis problem is happening in #27380: Sporadically, in the `mempool:rejected` test, execution does not reach the end of the callback function and the success counter is not incremented. Thus, the test fails when comparing the counter to its expected value of one. Without knowing which of the asserts failed any why it failed, this issue is hard to debug.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nTwo fixes come to mind. The first involves having the callback function make event data accessible outside the callback and inspecting the event using `assert_equal()` outside the callback. This solution still requires a counter in the callback in order  to tell whether a callback was actually executed or if instead the call to perf_buffer_poll() timed out.\r\n\r\nThe second fix entails wrapping all relevant `assert_equal()` statements inside callback functions into try-catch blocks and manually logging AssertionErrors. While not as elegant in terms of design, this approach can be more pragmatic for more complex tests (e.g., ones involving multiple events, events of different types, or the order of events).\r\n\r\nThe solution proposed here is to select the most pragmatic fix on a case-by-case basis: Tests in `interface_usdt_net.py`, `interface_usdt_mempool.py` and `interface_usdt_validation.py` have been refactored to use the first approach, while the second approach was chosen for `interface_usdt_utxocache.py` (partly to provide a reference for the second approach, but mainly because the utxocache tests are the most intricate tests, and refactoring them to use the first approach would negatively impact their readability). Lastly, `interface_usdt_coinselection.py` was kept unchanged because it does not use `assert_equal()` statements inside callback functions.\r\n",

      "message": "Manage exceptions in bcc callback functions\n\nExceptions are not propagated in ctype callback functions used by bcc.\nThis means an AssertionError exception raised by check_equal() to signal\na failed assertion is not getting caught and properly logged. Instead,\nthe error is logged to stdout and execution of the handler stops.\n\nThe current workaround to check whether all check_equal() assertions in\na callback succeeded is to increment a success counter after the\nassertions (which only gets incremented if none exception is raised and\nstops execution). Then, outside the callback, the success counter can be\nused to check whether a callback executed successfully.\n\nOne issue with the described workaround is that when an exception\noccurs, there is no way of telling which of the check_equal() statements\ncaused the exception; moreover, there is no way of inspecting how the\npieces of data that got compared in check_equal() differed (often\na crucial clue when debugging what went wrong).\n\nTwo fixes to this problem come to mind. The first involves having the\ncallback function make event data accessible outside the callback and\ninspecting the event using check_equal() outside the callback. This\nsolution still requires a counter in the callback to tell whether\na callback was actually executed or if instead the call to\nperf_buffer_poll() timed out.\n\nThe second fix entails wrapping all relevant check_equal() statements\ninside callback functions into try-catch blocks and manually logging\nAssertionErrors. While not as elegant in terms of design, this approach\ncan be more pragmatic for more complex tests (e.g., ones involving\nmultiple events, events of different types, or the order of events).\n\nThe solution proposed here is to select the most pragmatic fix on\na case-by-case basis: Tests in interface_usdt_net.py,\ninterface_usdt_mempool.py and interface_usdt_validation.py have been\nrefactored to use the first approach, while the second approach was\nchosen for interface_usdt_utxocache.py (partly to provide a reference\nfor the second approach, but mainly because the utxocache tests are the\nmost intricate tests, and refactoring them to use the first approach\nwould negatively impact their readability). Lastly,\ninterface_usdt_coinselection.py was kept unchanged because it does not\nuse check_equal() statements inside callback functions.",
