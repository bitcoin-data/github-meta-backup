    "body": "Prior to this commit callers of `FindNode(...)` were required to be holding `cs_vNodes` in the cases where they used the returned `CNode*` for anything aside from existence-checking (see #9626).\r\n\r\nThis resulted in locking `cs_vNodes` twice since `FindNode(...)` had a `LOCK(cs_vNodes);`.\r\n\r\nTo solve this and to make the locking requirements more explicit this commit does the following:\r\n* Add explicit locking requirements for `FindNode(...)` using `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_vNodes)`.\r\n* Remove the now redundant `LOCK(cs_vNodes)` in `FindNode(...)`.\r\n* Add a method `CConnman::NodeExists(...)` for existence-checking. Calling this method does not require holding `cs_vNodes`.",

Add NodeExists(...).\n\nPrior to this commit callers of `FindNode(...)` were required to\nbe holding `cs_vNodes` only in the cases where they used the\nreturned `CNode*` for anything aside from existence-checking\n(see #9626).\n\nThis resulted in locking `cs_vNodes` twice since `FindNode(...)`\nhad a `LOCK(cs_vNodes);`.\n\nTo solve this and to make the locking requirements more explicit this\ncommit does the following:\n* Add explicit locking requirements for `FindNode(...)`\n  using `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_vNodes)`.\n* Remove the now redundant `LOCK(cs_vNodes)` in `FindNode(...)`.\n* Add a method `CConnman::NodeExists(...)` for existence-checking.\n  Calling this method does not require holding `cs_vNodes`.",
