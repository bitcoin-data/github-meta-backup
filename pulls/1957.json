This feature needs to be included into the core because there needs to be a uniform RPC call defined that other bitcoin clients will adopt.\n\nI don't really know why an additional RPC call is met by a fear of the code maintanance overhead. This is pretty much just a wrapper function for signmessage. It's soo easy to maintain that I can't imagine the justification for NOT including it o.o If it was a security risk, or posed more maintainance, bloat, or other such problems I would understand, but on pius principle just isn't a valid reason to soo swiftly discount the inclusion.\n\nThis isn't controversial, why is it being made so?\n",

How about keeping \"signfile\" and \"verifyfile\" as client-side calls that generate a hash of the file that's sent to the server for re-hashing and signing. I think _something_ like this belongs in this client, as it's basically the reference implementation of bitcoin, there's not much point signing files in a different way in each different client.\n",
