We used similar reasoning with the peering changes that accompanied segwit: the preferential peering was active long before segwit activated, by design, so that the network topology could change gradually with software deployment, and any unexpected behaviors could be understood and corrected before the consensus changes took place.\r\n\r\nI don't feel strongly about whether the change in this PR happens now (ie for the 0.15 release, which is imminent), or in a future 0.15.1 or so, assuming we expect the latter to happen well in advance of any planned chain splits.  But I strongly believe the network topology should largely adjust pre-fork, and not post-fork, to minimize disruption.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I don't think that btc1 making a network magic code change at the fork point would eliminate the need for this PR -- the goal is for the network topology to start changing earlier, and not suddenly be disrupted.  (Perhaps if btc1 changed network magic a few weeks or more before any planned fork, then that would be sufficient to eliminate the need here, but as I see https://github.com/btc1/bitcoin/issues/99#issuecomment-320450248 there is clearly no appetite for this.)\r\n\r\nBased on the adoption rates of earlier releases, I don't expect the whole network to suddenly upgrade to 0.15 and cause a network split (I happen to personally run many older versions of bitcoin core, and I assume many others do too, which would serve as bridges).  \r\n\r\nIf we had more time on our hands and someone was so inclined, a more conservative change would be to just limit the number of outbound peers that offer these service bits, eg to 2 out of our 8.  However, given the relatively constrained time frames, I don't think the review burden of a more complicated change is worth it, given how low risk I view this change to already be.  And if we want to get this merged for 0.15 or 0.15.1 the change should be as minimal as possible, along the lines of this PR.\r\n\r\nWill test.",

The idea that the network should suddenly change topology come hard fork is only adding potential for issues on that day, so this change can only help y'all smoothly fork off.",

      "body": "> Disconnecting peers that are otherwise 100% interoperable is just bananas.\r\n\r\n> It is the opposite of the Robustness Principle (\"be liberal in what you accept') of RFC1122 and elsewhere: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#section-1.2.2\r\n\r\n@jgarzik The the Postel maxim is widely, if not yet universally, considered to be a broken idea of the past. When it's brought up in the IETF it's usually with regret or with mocking-- it is directly responsible for many serious problems on the internet today.  ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3117#section-4.5 http://programmingisterrible.com/post/42215715657/postels-principle-is-a-bad-idea ).\r\n\r\nIt's also frequently in direct conflict with security and reliability.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those cases.  Sudden changes in network topology can leave a node isolated from compatible consensus rules.  We depend on long lived connections for durability from various DOS attacks.   If suddenly a node finds all its peers incompatible with it even if its smart enough to rapidly realize this and ban incompatible peers (as Bcash's adoption of the segwit signature scheme for replay protection provided but which nothing in s2x provides), it may find that it can not find anything to connect to, e.g. because attackers have filled most of the slots elsewhere on the network.\r\n\r\nS2X nodes are not 100% compatible, because compatibility includes what the connection will do in the future as well.\r\n\r\nA Bitcoin node depends on information being easy to spread and hard to stifle, but this assumption doesn't hold when you're surrounded with peers with incompatible rules-- the incompatible peers will stifle your communications with the Bitcoin network.  The only way to be sure to have robust connections to peers with compatible rules when some event happens is to have them well before the event, so they enjoy protected high priority slots.\r\n\r\nThis was discussed extensively in the design and development of segwit, since segwit itself results in a change in P2P networking. After extensive consideration we found the best way to make sure there was no problem was to make the topology change in advance.  In particular, this moves any topology change related issues for a single node to the time of upgrade, when the operator is certainly paying attention, rather than later when they are not.\r\n\r\nConsider a node with 8 peers, all s2x nodes. At some height the s2x issuance activates, and s2x stops sending valid blocks to our node. Yet the s2x network then takes hours (like Bcash, or over a day like the btc1 testnet) to mine the even a single additional block, and because s2x has no replay protection invalid tx signatures will also not cause banning. When s2x does get a block it will only disconnect a single peer and may find connection slots exhausted all over the net (due to attacks or increased demand from other links cutting).  If it has a single connection up to the Bitcoin network, if it has more blocks it may not even notice s2x blocks are invalid if they're part of a less-work chain, since s2x doesn't use the HF bit.  All of this disruption, potentially quite severe and damaging (e.g. esp if our node in question is a Bitcoin miner) is avoided by not making a hard cut change to the network topology, but instead adopting a topology from the moment the node starts that will continue to be good for it in the future, with the change happening over time rather than as a network wide system-shock.\r\n\r\nAbove, the claim is made above that \"Bitcoin Core nodes would disconnect all segwit2x nodes\"; but that isn't the case-- only nodes running this newer software would do so. Historical update rates suggest that this will only be a moderate part of the network. But this moderate part is also important because it means there will be a reasonably large chunk of the network which are more likely to be healthy, partitioned, and more able to take the connections from nodes running older code which aren't aware of the topology change.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of, and I haven't seen presented any argument that there was an actual meaningful risk of any kind of premature partitioning as a result of this under any kind of realistic assumptions.  If I've missed it, please walk me through how that might happen.\r\n\r\n> Let's figure out a way to cooperate and maximize interoperability.\r\n\r\nThat sounds great, but people have been trying to do so recommending basic prudent changes that would prevent disruption which your project has very vigorously (and in many causes insultingly) rejected.-- including things that even Bcash got right.  Especially when your project insists on an nonnegotiable position of making these changes with many times less time than we have consistently expressed is needed to safely accomplish such things. If cooperation is in your plans, why is it not evidence in the timeframes or in the activities thus far?\r\n\r\nMost confusingly, given the relative ratio of nodes in the network changes like this are likely to be even more protective of S2X users than they are of Bitcoin's users.",

      "body": "\"Ease transition to incompatibility\" makes no sense to me.\nPlease @jgarzik explain why there's a problem in 0.15 nodes not being\nconnected to swx2 nodes - preferrably with an example of something going\nwrong -, answer one or more of the question raised in this pr that you have\nignored so far or please, please stop it.\n\nReview: I think there's value in creating the constants even if the\ncomments are clear because it reduces the chances of some other\nimplementation (or even a programmer in the same implementation) to use a\nreserved bit without noticing. I propose the following constant names:\nSRV_BIT_INCOMPATIBILITY1 and\nSRV_BIT_INCOMPATIBILITY2. That will make clearer what these service bits\nare about while keeping them in the same place as other sevice bits for a\ncode reader to read.\n\nBtc1 review (don't ask me why I'm still doing it):\nOne easy way to avoid getting disconnected from 0.15 nodes is not using any\nof those 2 incompatibility bits at all in your implementation. Another way\nwould be to move to another bit, but then I would propose to create\nSRV_BIT_INCOMPATIBILITY3\n(assuming nobody beats me to it).\n\nAnother much simpler way, which would also render this discussion useless\n(or so I think, I'm happy to be corrected and learn), would be for\nhardforks to always use the hardfork bit (you could even save the worry of\nwhether the first hf block will have enough real txs to create a bigger\nblock in an invalid way or miners will need to create artificial txs to\nfill the block with the needed amount of garbage).\n\n<offtopic> I bet this comment will be ignored here by you, jef, like my\nsuggestion to use the hf bit was ignored in the btc1 repository. I hope I'm\nwrong.\nI heard that it is better to be listen than to be listened. But I wonder if\nthat still applies when you're talking to someone who never listens and\njust repeats the same thing over and over with different words or in a\ndifferent order.\n\n<super_offtopic> I once admired you. Last drop in a full glass.\n\nOn 6 Aug 2017 02:49, \"Jeff Garzik\" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\nIt is not easing a transition when fully interoperable clients are\ndisconnected for no other reason than a service bit is set. For the time\nperiod starting now through segwit2x fork time, It is creating disruption\nwhere, provably, none would have otherwise existed.\n\nAbsent this change, Bitcoin Core and segwit2x peers will communicate\nwithout error for months to come.\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10982#issuecomment-320476760>, or mute\nthe thread\n<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AA9jSprzP6qG3jluofMl2UI7xYxIcxChks5sVP-QgaJpZM4Os6bg>\n.\n",

      "body": "ACK, based on user experience\r\n\r\n> Disconnecting peers that are otherwise 100% interoperable is just bananas.\r\n\r\n@jgarzik I disagree with you here.  I was running the Bitcoin-ABC client before and after the recent chainsplit.  Before the chainsplit occurred I was connected exclusively to many Bitcoin Core peers and was worried about what would happen after the split.  Then when the chainsplit happened my Bitcoin-ABC node kept cycling through hundreds of Bitcoin Core peers and banning them.  I was struggling to find good peers for days.  The wallet was very difficult to use, it was often many blocks behind what people were telling me on internet chat forums and many of my transactions took a long time to propagate and I had to re-broadcast some of them hundreds of times for them to work.  Please consider the actual user experience when making these decisions.\r\n\r\nI do not understand what you want to happen.  Are you expecting all nodes to be connected to each other, then in one instant when the chainsplit occurs, for two separate p2p networks to magically  form?  Sorry to be rude, but that seems \"bananas\" to me.  It was tried with Bitcoin-ABC and I had a terrible experience.\r\n\r\nSince nodes need to upgrade for SegWit2x anyway, why not build the new network magic before the chainsplit occurs, that way it can be far smoother than somehow expecting it to happen instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

And things went better than they might have for ABC-- had there been more miners initially and they experienced connectivity like yours they easily could have split into little islands working against each other...\r\n\r\nMoreover the churn from a sudden topology change would greatly amplify the effect of DOS attacks on the network, because part of our protections is that attackers have a hard time tampering with long uptime links with a history of good behavior.  The sudden change turns that protection into a liability when peers with a history of good behavior all turn bad at once.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Please correct me if I'm wrong, but assuming a large portion of NYA-signaling miners would actually start using the btc1 client, wouldn't this change end up starving out miners who wish to use Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 _before the fork_, as they wouldn't be able to get blocks as quickly as the btc1-only mining network? Or is every miner supposed to be using the FIBRE network anyways?\r\n\r\nAlso, as a Core user making transactions, wouldn't this mean that it becomes harder for transactions to find their way into blocks? Or are you hoping the un-upgraded 0.14.3 nodes pick up all the slack of relaying these transactions, and when the old node count dwindles as people upgrade, makes the problem worse?\r\n\r\nWhat prevents the btc1 project from just changing or disabling its service bit to avoid this disruption, like what @gandrewstone is saying?\r\n\r\nAs long as you are putting in specific rules for specific clients, why not just partition off at the fork block? Or slowly disconnect up to the fork, not all at once on upgrade?",

Where is your concern that Bitcoin also disconnects litecoin nodes?\r\n\r\nThere will always be malicious peers out there that will lie. That we can't help.  Also, this PR disconnects, rather than banning. (In fact, it protects the peers addresses from banning, which will avoid compatible software on the same IPs getting banned everywhere in the network... which happened to some ABC users-- where their Bitcoin node had a hard time getting connections because ABC had gotten them banned all over the place).",

      "body": "@piotrnar It sounds like you are expressing a misunderstanding  of the Bitcoin system.\r\n\r\nThe consensus rules are what defines what is or isn't mining.  Namecoin or BCash or whatever miners are not Bitcoin miners because they produce blocks which violate Bitcoin's rules.  If you look at the Bitcoin whitepaper, section 8 paragraph 2 talks about how nodes are protected against being overpowered by a majority of hashpower mining blocks which are invalid because they enforce the rules themselves.   It would have been possible to define Bitcoin a different way where nodes blindly trust miners, but that isn't how it works or has ever worked.  A miner that breaks the rules is simply ignored, and this is an integral part of the system of incentives that keeps the system from becoming insecure.\r\n\r\nThis is all pretty far off-topic for this PR now... and it shows in that several of the last posts are nothing but random people (Pheromon, and CSmith7703)  hurling abusive comments and insults at me. This is not appropriate here and not welcome.  We don't come into your projects and insult you. Please take it elsewhere.",
