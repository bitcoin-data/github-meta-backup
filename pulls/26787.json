Moreover, there are core problems relating to the technical convergence between the macOS GUI and Terminal App CLI. Specifically, the GUI and CLI are not in sync, which signifies problems deeper in the macOS architecture. \r\n\r\nI think it is important to focus on solving the real problem at hand, which is how to build bitcoin with a Mac. There is no reason to reference or direct developers to the Applications folder that I know of and please correct me if you believe I am mistaken. Here, the Principle of Parismony should apply and the simpler explanation is better.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In the GUI, the terminal effectively still appears to be in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`\r\n\r\nThese instructions, by definition, are only relevant to people that are using the GUI, because if they were using a terminal they already know where the terminal is. As such, I think they are fine to keep as is. I also wouldn't be terribly opposed to removing them, but frankly to me this just looks like a waste of time.",

I am still working through the pathing problem on installation defined in #26778. I ran into a massive sub-problem with the data requirements and now have to remove the installed software, but I'm struggling to find it on my machine because of the broader pathing issue.\r\n\r\nSome questions I have generally on contributions to Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n1. Does the core team want OSS developers to contribute?\r\n2. Does the core team want to solve problems in Bitcoin Core?\r\n3. What incentive is there for contributing to Bitcoin Core?\r\n\r\nI am indifferent to the answer to these questions, I just don't have a good way to gauge the climate or need for the network. So, I only identify problems based on my own experience developing. Of course, one developers problems could also be another developers solution, especially if the intention is to keep developers out, as is the case with many L1s. It's ok if that is the intention here too, it would just be helpful to know ahead of time. I don't want to bother anyone here if the core team does not want help or new solutions.",

There are a lot of open issues of any difficulty waiting to be fixed. However, before you start contributing, familiarize yourself with the Bitcoin Core build system and tests. Refer to the documentation in the repository on how to build Bitcoin Core and how to run the unit and functional tests. Once that is done, you are all set.\r\n\r\nIf you need more help getting started, please refer to the following resources:\r\n\r\n* https://medium.com/@amitiu/onboarding-to-bitcoin-core-7c1a83b20365\r\n* https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core\r\n\r\n### Pick something to work on\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for useful contributions to help out with, you can\r\n\r\n* Search through the [good first issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)s or the ones that are [up for grabs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22). Some of them might no longer be applicable. So if you are interested, but unsure, you might want to leave a comment on the issue first.\r\n* Write tests to improve the coverage. Any kind of test is welcome and coverage information can be obtained from a relatively recent [coverage report](https://marcofalke.github.io/btc_cov). If you are unsure, don't hesitate to check back first.\r\n* Help with review and testing. There are easy ones such as the [gui](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pulls) and [rpc](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3ARPC%2FREST%2FZMQ). However, review on any open pull request is welcome. Review will also help you understand the codebase better.\r\n* Help on meta projects related to Bitcoin Core, such as a [high-level performance monitor](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/bitcoinperf).\r\n* Join us on irc and let us know what you are interested in.",

The goal for the feature request was to prevent that from happening and have a clear installation path, which you appropriately identified as downloading from the `src`, rather than downloading binaries. I did not previously know the difference.\r\n\r\nMy aim with this PR was to make things less confusing by removing unnecessary terminal discussion because there is a core problem with downloading Bitcoin Core on macOS for purposes of development. You can download `bitcoind` to get `bitcoin-cli` access, but the problem is downloading bitcoin core to the `Applications Support` folder only gives you GUI access and downloading `bitcoind` requires over `500 GB` of storage. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think @sipa solved this almost 10 years ago on [Stack Exchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/13368/whats-the-difference-between-bitcoind-and-bitcoin-qt-different-commands). So, the solution for a lightweight installation for developers, or at least the next one I want to pursue, is running `bitcoin-qt -server` from `src`. This should allow for both prune mode to reduce the storage requirement and for developers to gain access to `bitcoin-cli`.\r\n\r\nOnce I've done this and validated the method, I can write up a new guide to solve #26778. Thanks again for your help, @fanquake.  \r\n\r\n",
