      "body": "Catching up on this, but IIRC, the last time this issue was discussed, http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2018-11-29.html#l-479, the main problem was considered to be:\r\n\r\n> your balance suddenly showing zero when you make a small payment.. because now your change is unconfirmed\r\n\r\nwhich would be fixed by implementing:\r\n\r\n> desired behavior is that balances shows confirmed + trusted-in-mempool-0conf.  And that you be able to adjust the threshold for confirmed and turn the trusted-in-mempool-zeroconf on and off. And if you make the confirmed=0, it should still only count in-mempool\r\n\r\nIt seems like this PR is addressing the problem in a different way. Instead of treating not fully confirmed spends from the wallet as trusted (and therefore including change in the balance), it is treating not fully confirmed spends as actually unspent (and therefore including the whole output value in the balance)?\r\n\r\nIt's possible I'm confused, but it would help if there was an explanation of how this fix relates to previous discussion (or doesn't relate, if it is just a tangential bugfix).",

From that PR:\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, CWallet::GetBalance (the trusted-only implementation) did not support setting a min_conf parameter. This was added in #13566, but only checked min_conf for UTXO creation, not UTXO spending.\r\n\r\nI don't understand Luke's assertion that the getbalance value should be 9.99 and -10.01. Displaying negative balance doesn't make sense to me.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour should now be that when calling `getbalance` with a minconf value:\r\n- coins that have received but have fewer than minconf confirmations are excluded\r\n- coins that have been spent but have fewer than minconf confirmations are included\r\n\r\nEffectively, this gives the balance at (TIP - minconf) height.\r\n\r\nThat behaviour makes sense to me, and I think best reflects the description in the RPC help for minconf: \"Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.\" It was what I understood commit 1ac717f8d836b16d5cb808c07f0578a309f4e9d0 in #14602 was attempting.\r\n\r\nIf people disagree that this is the desired behaviour, then I can amend or close this PR. Also happy to add more documentation if people think that's required.",

E.g. if I received 5 BTC at depth 3 and spent 4 BTC at depth 2, would getbalance(minconf=3) would show a balance of 1 before this PR and 5 after?\r\n\r\nYou need to consider the UTXO model here, rather than just balances. Here's your scenario:\r\n\r\ndepth 3: receive a 5 BTC UTXO (a)\r\ndepth 2: spend the 5 BTC UTXO (a)\r\n                    - create a 4 BTC payment UTXO (b)\r\n                    - receive a 1 BTC change UTXO (c)\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `getbalance(minconf=3)` would show a balance of **0**: (a) is not included because it has been spent, and (c) is not included because it does not have the necessary number of confirmations. After this PR, `getbalance(minconf=3)` would show a balance of 5, because (a) has the necessary number of confirmations and (b) and (c) don't.\r\n\r\n@sipa:\r\n\r\n> I think we've always counted balance as the sum of incoming UTXOs with sufficient confirmations, but which haven't been spent afterwards (even with lower confirmations).\r\n\r\nIn the scenario above, would you include the change output (c) in your balance? ie amend your definition to be: (sum of incoming UTXOs with sufficient confirmations which haven't been spent afterwards) + (sum of change UTXOs). In that case, should I count change transactions where the input UTXO has fewer confirmations than `minconf`?\r\n\r\nTo me, a balance in Bitcoin can only make sense at a given block (ie given the UTXO set associated with this block, what is the total amount of UTXOs that I can sign for?) Any alternative definition (eg the amount of UTXOs that I can sign for less those UTXOs where I have evidence they can be spent, etc) leads to confusing inconsistencies like the example above.",

      "body": "Thanks for the explanation.\r\n\r\n> To me, a balance in Bitcoin can only make sense at a given block (ie given the UTXO set associated with this block, what is the total amount of UTXOs that I can sign for?)\r\n\r\nThis definition of a balance does make sense, but it seems not very useful, and even dangerous in the example above, where somebody might think they have 5 BTC to spend instead of 1.\r\n\r\nI think the definition of a `minconf` balance that'd be most useful would be the answer to the question in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15010#issuecomment-454478112, \"If I only trust blocks with depth >= `minconf`, how much money can I be sure I have?\" It might not be practical to compute this with all conflicting spends that may be in the wallet. But if we only consider non-conflicting spends in the chain and mempool, it seems like we could start including outputs like (c) from the example. Maybe a modified [`IsTrusted`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e14cd04abbb56ed1bc65aa817132f5d6de6a37cf/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2074-L2104) check would work, that makes sure every transaction input is from the wallet and either has depth greater than minconf, or recursively satisfies the same check.",

Perhaps that's a bit of a legalistic answer, but the only thing that brings us sureness in Bitcoin is confirmations. Talking about a balance outside of confirmed transactions is dangerous in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThat's fair. I didn't specify the assumptions I was making with my suggested implementation. It would give the balance assuming you only created normal transactions with the bitcoin wallet and didn't broadcast conflicting transactions, or export your keys somewhere, etc. It would be possible to do more work and come up with an implementation that made fewer assumptions (like only assuming that the wallet knows about conflicting transactions, not that they were never broadcast) to produce a more useful `minconf` balance, but this may also be too dangerous, or just not worth the effort to implement.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't think there is an argument for `minconf` to be interpreted the way this PR currently interprets it, which is like a request for an old balance from a point in history. So I might suggest closing this PR. Or if you think this behavior is useful, it might be better to expose it as a new RPC like `gethistoricbalance` and take a height argument rather than a depth argument.\r\n\r\nBut I guess I still would be curious if @sipa has a different answer to your questions from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15010#issuecomment-476857724.\r\n\r\nAlso, I was surprised to see the conclusion the last time this topic was discussed in IRC (http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2018-11-29.html#l-596), since it seems like it is basically just requesting the current getbalance(minconf=0) behavior:\r\n\r\n> \\<gmaxwell> Right, I think the desired behavior is that balances shows confirmed + trusted-in-mempool-0conf\r\n\r\nBut it was also interesting to read because there are other potential getbalance improvements discussed there.",
