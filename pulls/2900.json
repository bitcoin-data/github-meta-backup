In addition a number of DoS attacks are made significantly\neasier by bloom support, so having an option makes it easy to take\nimmediate steps in the event of an attack.\n",

      "body": "I asked Peter to open this pull.\n\nService bitting bloom makes sense to me— it increases nodes control over the granularity of the services they are providing the public, should it be needed— I have no clue why I didn't ask for this to begin with.  The primary risk I see with this is that it will potentially result in increased levels lazy alternative node implementers not implementing the bloom server side functionality, but at the same time at least those nodes will be identifiable and avoidable (as opposed to them simply not implementing and making your connecting life hard). So I do not believe it would be useful to protocol-version-suicide-pact the bloom functionality.\n\nIf we're concerned that ignorant node operators may turn off bloom when they don't need to, we could remove the hidden switch, but I'm not especially concerned about that as bloom saves a lot of bandwidth when not being abused.\n\nSeparately, this is what litecoin has implemented since they had the benefit of later knowledge when they did their protocol update that added bloom support. So anything that supports litecoin would have the service bit testing in any case.\n",

      "body": "So the argument is that because you can ask a peer to use _less_ bandwidth, that makes dos attacks _worse_?\n\nYou can't fix a denial of service by denying service. That's backwards, especially as I don't recall the last time I saw a DoS attacker who actually paid for his own bandwidth. The only way to fix it is to figure out who should be getting service and ensuring they get it first. So why don't you fix it by allowing nodes to prioritise inbound connections?\n",

      "body": "@mikehearn As you know the DoS attacks identified are not attacks on bandwidth, but rather other resources. Those attacks are significantly easier to pull off if the attacker can reduce the amount of data the targets send back to them; bloom filters do exactly that by reducing the INV messages the attacker receives, allowing one computer to attack a very large number of nodes with very little bandwidth consumption.\n\nIt would be helpful if you responded on the email list with what types of prioritization you would consider most useful for SPV clients - @johndillon attempted to start that discussion but I haven't seen you reply. Disabling bloom filters is a form of prioritization in of itself of course, as SPV nodes do not contribute back to the network by relaying data. It is much better for them to have temporary issues connecting in an attack than for relaying in general to fail, something that could lead to a dangerous fork due to convergence failure.\n\nRegardless as @gmaxwell pointed out aside from attacks, the protocol should allow for nodes to advertise whether or not they support bloom filters as a matter of good protocol design - it is after all a service. It's telling that when I mentioned that NODE_BLOOM didn't exist, @gmaxwell was surprised.\n",

      "body": "Can we cut it out with \"revealing the exploit\" stuff? It's trivial to find DoS attacks on bitcoind. I did it for fun last time this came up and it took about 45 minutes. I was going to post about it (it's a memory bloat issue) and then got distracted with the RNG stuff.\n\nWhy would we make bloom filtering optional? There's no benefit to be had from that at this point. If somebody wants to reimplement the protocol for some reason, they can reimplement that too. No big deal. Clients that rely on it are not dramatically less important than other nodes. They're called \"end users\" and they're extremely important!\n\nYou can force nodes to do arbitrary amounts of disk seeking with or without Bloom filtering. Just ask for random blocks in the chain. Asking them to filter the blocks adds some CPU load, but that just multiplies resource exhaustion dimensions from 1 to 2. Recall that most average hard disks can only manage about 100 seeks per second. Connect 100 times, request one random block per second per connection and all the seeks are gone. Bandwidth usage is hardly a problem. Nodes don't remember what data elements they already served so you can just do that forever, but even if they did you could just reconnect every so often to make them forget.\n\nI think I've explained how to implement a working anti-DoS strategy several times by now. If I didn't reply to John it's only because this issue keeps coming up and I feel like I'm repeating myself.\n\nFirst step - make nodes understand their own resource limits. This is useful anyway because an operator may not want bitcoind to eat all available machine resources, and currently it will just if it legitimately gets busy.\n\nSecond step - implement handlers that run when the node is running out of resources, that perform load shedding. For example, throwing out low priority transactions in the mempool, disconnecting peers that score badly (idle for long periods of time, use lots more memory than would be expected, etc). Coming up with good scoring functions is a big part of the art of DoS defence. This is where you'd score transactions before signature checking as well.\n\nThird step - once you force attackers to basically act just like regular network nodes, you can introduce an optional cookie mechanism so if there are suddenly thousands of clients that appear to be well behaved, clients that have a long history get priority over clients that appeared 5 minutes ago. This also helps in the case where Bitcoin \"suffers\" a sudden spike in popularity. Established users take priority over new users.\n\nFinal step - optimise everything so the amount of load you can handle before falling over gets pushed higher and higher.\n\nThe wrong strategy is the one being pursued here:\n\n1) Find a feature that uses resources\n2) Panic and disable it\n3) GOTO 1\n\nThe last time this happened I described the strategy as a \"death spiral\" and I wasn't joking.\n",

      "body": "Mike, enough with the overheated rhetoric.\n\nOccasionally nodes will have reasons not to offer the bloom filter service, while still having block data. (NODE_NETWORK) Right now the protocol doesn't give any way to say that, adding the NODE_BLOOM service bit lets you do that.\n\nOf course, if you are going to have NODE_BLOOM, it's useful to be able to disable the bloom service for testing SPV clients, hence the undocumented command line flag. The code implementing the feature also shows what should happen if a node doesn't support bloom filters: kick peers requiring that feature so they won't waste their bandwidth. It'd also be useful as a temporary emergency measure if a DoS attack is launched, but in the meantime we don't have any reason to expect users to use the flag. It is unfortunate that Gavin's revealed a particularly effective one, but that's life. In any case, finding DoS attacks may be trivial for you, but our attackers don't seem to find them on their own and seem to only launch them after they have been revealed publicly prior to a patch.\n\nIf you want to talk about priority schemes, move it to the email list and reply to @johndillon's thread rather than cluttering up this pull-req with off-topic discussion. Your ideas only work against some types of attacks in any case.\n",

      "body": "@gavinandresen I don't really follow your reasoning; assuming an attack exists (ignoring whether it does or not for now), then forcing everyone to be vulnerable is certainly worse than making it optional and advertizing it (perhaps combining it with stronger anti-DoS measures, knowing that it may reduce availability of other offered services).\n\nI do agree with @mikehearn that a decent resource-limitating implementation is necessary as a generic solution against DoS attacks. I do believe that's orthogonal to the approach taken by this change, though.\n\nThe services offered by P2P nodes to the network (for free!) are quite distinct, and have different use cases, different clients, and different attack models:\n- (unfiltered) old blocks are only necessary for full nodes that are synchronizing. The only thing that matters is bandwidth really (latency is only important in so far that extreme degradation would increase sybil-vulnerability).\n- (unfiltered) recent blocks are only necessary for full nodes keeping up with the chain, and mostly need low latency to keep the convergence speed of the network fast. Bandwidth is only important when it starts influencing latency.\n- (filtered) blocks are only necessary for SPV nodes, and the same old/new distinction exists (old blocks need bandwidth, new blocks need latency).\n- lone transactions are only necessary for distribution to miners and (to the extent possible) aim of the network to prevent 0-conf double spending. Until the payment protocol takes off, it also matters for distribution to receivers, but this isn't necessary IMHO. I believe all this is mostly best-effort in any case, and secondary to the other services offered.\n\nIn my opinion, these are sufficiently independent from each other that they should be easily isolatable. We're relying on charity of those running full nodes to provide these services, and which of these they consider important for the survival of the network may differ. Additionally, not all of these are necessarily present to the same extent in the network - there may be more demand for some than for others. This all speaks in favor of having separate services bits for them. Maybe at some point more specialized and separately-maintained software for each exists, though that's probably not for soon.\n\nOn the other hand, requiring full node implementations to support SPV functionality probably benefits the popularity of Bitcoin as a payment system, and may improve its usefulness to the economy. \"Surviving\" up to the point where we're worried about certain attacks may be more important than dealing with those attacks in the first place. Still, ultimately this is about whether alternate full node implementations are allowed to not implement SPV services, and they may have reasons not to (perhaps because they offer a competing lightweight client model). If the choice is between them not implementing Bloom filtering (and ignore requests, or disconnect in case of such requests), and them being able to advertize not supporting it in the first place, I certainly choose the latter.\n\nI lean towards ACK, but this discussion probably belongs elsewhere (it's not entirely specific to the reference client), and certainly warrants a BIP. The implementation looks good in any case.\n",

      "body": "A good example where the very different requirements of the different types of nodes matters is for anyone with a lot of bandwidth available to them, but not a lot of disk io or memory, a common scenario for servers in datacenters.\n\nThe most efficient way to push blocks over the wire for such a server would be to use sendfile() to do a direct copy from the blockchain data on disk to the network interface - behind the scenes Linux will use direct zero-copy DMA transfers of the data from the disk interface to the network interface, or system memory to the network interface, using almost no CPU in the process. On the other hand that means the blocks have to be sent unfiltered, which is fine if my peer needs the whole block. This arrangement uses the resources I have available most efficiently for the sake of the network.\n\nBut if I start accepting SPV clients I can't use sendfile() anymore, and even worse is that because I'm serving those SPV clients filtered blocks I'm using up far more disk IO than network bandwidth, when what I have available to me is the opposite.\n\nInterestingly the opposite case is common too: lots of home users running nodes have plenty of disk IO available, especially if they have SSD's, but very poor upload capacity. It would probably make sense for full nodes to prefer to connect to nodes without NODE_BLOOM set, especially if they are syncing a lot of archival history, leaving capacity on the NODE_BLOOM capable nodes for SPV clients that need it.\n",

A single user who didn't upgrade could get their entire local cell tower or even city banned from every node with your patch activated, even for clients that are upgraded.\n\nYou could make it backwards compatible by not having such nodes take part in the regular P2P network at all and provide a separate DNS seed for them, so old clients would never see them at all, but then if you're going to have a separate P2P network why not use a P2P system that's actually designed for file distribution, like BitTorrent? \n\nIgnoring for now that Bitcoin-Qt doesn't have any SPV support and nobody is working on any, fancy automatic migration of SPV nodes to full nodes doesn't make sense from a user experience perspective - the requirements are just so different, such arguments don't persuade me. \n\nAs it is, the maintainer of the serving side says this patch is a bad idea, the maintainer of the client side says this is a bad idea, so what do you hope to achieve by keeping this issue open? It gets quite frustrating when the people who are actually maintaining the code bases that are affected by this patch both say \"this is a bad idea\" and you just plough on regardless.\n",

      "body": "Ah good, finally you looked at the code. Anyone have any comments re: the DoS behavior? I could potentially change it to simply close the associated connection.\n\nService bits are meant to advertise services, and performing computations on behalf of clients who don't serve other clients sounds very much like a service to me. That said I'd be very surprised to see many nodes operators disabling bloom filters as the command-line switch to do so is undocumented, so we've got plenty of time to upgrade DNS seeds to let nodes pick service bits they want, or just require NODE_BLOOM to be set if protocol version >=70002. (DNS seeds are just for bootstrapping after all and nodes should use them infrequently; no sense putting too much effort into them vs. decentralized peer discovery)\n\nI'm sure more people would run Bitcoin-QT full-nodes if it was useful immediately, albeit with reduced SPV security. We could certainly use more full nodes. You like to say how businesses will \"obviously\" run full nodes - maybe we can make it easier for them by getting their nodes up and running as fast as possible. An attractive alternative is to just use a central service immediately rather than waiting after all.\n\nNote the positive comments and ACKS from gmaxwell, sipa, jgarzik, and wtogami - the reference client is maintained by a group of people, not just one guy who calls the shots.\n",

What's the way forward here?\n\nIt is clear that next time that a service is introduced on the P2P network we have to be more careful, and add a services bit (or another way) to advertise the service instead of making it mandatory at a protocol version. This makes it possible for the node owner to choose whether to run the service or not, and to disable it if problems arise.\n\nHowever for Bloom filtering I think this ship has sailed. All SPV clients rely on this functionality to be available with NODE_NETWORK, and it seems unreasonable to break this expectation in a new protocol version.\n",

From what I've seen an heard, their SPV clients are not acutally looking for the service bit, since this patch is designed to be backwards compatible and there are only few nodes which disable bloom filters. Instead they are disconnected when trying to set the bloom filter and choose another node instead.\n\nI think giving node operators the option to influence cpu/bandwith tradeoffs based on their needs is a good idea, and experience from altcoins seems to suggest that SPV clients are not negatively impacted by this change in a notable way.\n",

If bitcoind were routinely saturating my cheap little VPS' CPU this sort of quick hack would be a lot more compelling, but there's no sign of such problems.
