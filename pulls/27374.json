    "body": "Follow up for #27264.\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure that our persistent outbound slots belong to different netgroups, distinct net groups of our peers are added to `setConnected`. Weâ€™d only open a persistent outbound connection to peers which have a different netgroup compared to those netgroups present in `setConnected`.\r\n\r\nCurrent `GetGroup()` logic assumes route-based diversification behaviour for tor/i2p/cjdns addresses (addresses are public key based and not route-based). Distinct netgroups possible (according to the current `GetGroup()` logic) for:\r\n1. tor => 030f, 031f, .. 03ff (16 possibilities)\r\n2. i2p => 040f, 041f, .. 04ff (16 possibilities)\r\n3. cjdns => 05fc0f, 05fc1f, ... 05fcff (16 possibilities)\r\n\r\n`setConnected` is used in `ThreadOpenConnections()` before making [outbound](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/84f4ac39fda7ffa5dc84e92d92dd1eeeb5e20f8c/src/net.cpp#L1846) and [anchor](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/84f4ac39fda7ffa5dc84e92d92dd1eeeb5e20f8c/src/net.cpp#L1805) connections to new peers so that they belong to distinct netgroups.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on master**\r\n\r\n- if we run a node only on tor/i2p/cjdns\r\n\t- we wouldn't be able to open more than 16 outbound connections(manual, block-relay-only anchor, outbound full relay, block-relay-only connections) because we run out of possible netgroups.\r\n\t- see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264#issuecomment-1481322628\r\n\t- tested by changing `MAX_OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY_CONNECTIONS` to 17 with `onlynet=onion` and observed how node wouldn't make more than 16 outbound connections.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on PR**\r\n\r\n- netgroup diversity checks are skipped for tor/i2p/cjdns addresses. \r\n- we don't insert tor/i2p/cjdns address in `setConnected` and `GetGroup` doesn't get called on tor/i2p/cjdns(see #27369)\r\n",

As far as I can see, this logic should equally be applied to addrs from alt networks, so it might be better to leave `setConnected` unchanged as sdaftuar suggested?\r\n",

It looks to me that trying to solve the problem of \"cannot open many connections to Tor\" this would create another problem: \"too many connections to Tor\" - it would allow all 8 outbound to be to Tor and will not try to diversify to IPv4 (or other networks).\r\n\r\nI feel that we should lookup `-onlynet` or allow connections to Tor up to a limit to avoid \"too many connections to Tor\". Or maybe, increase the 4 bits to 5 bits in `GetGroup()` :disappointed:. In the long term, I guess, it would be best to expand the concept of \"network group\" to \"network group with route based diversification\" (IP) + \"network group without route based diversification\" (tor/i2p/cjdns).\r\n\r\nPS This is very much related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213\r\nPS run `clang-format`",

Add an additional check inside `LimitOutboundByNetgroup()` to skip netgroup diversity checks for outbound connections belonging to pure Tor-only/I2P-only/CJDNS-only networks. Then use this as a gatekeeper before choosing diverse netgroup addresses to make outbound connections to.\r\n2.

(otherwise we can go with option 1 for now)",

As far as I can see, this logic should equally be applied to addrs from alt networks, so it might be better to leave `setConnected` unchanged as sdaftuar suggested?\r\n\r\n@lightlike Good observation, I missed this.  I think that bit of code that we're using in our `OpenNetworkConnection()` call is really trying to determine how many open connections we have, not how many distinct netgroups we're connected to?  So from that perspective, I believe that line of code is written incorrectly; if we are running only on Tor and we happen to have 8 peers from the same netgroup, then presumably we are sufficiently connected that any failures to connect should be recorded in addrman.\r\n\r\nSo I think the right change here is to modify that line to just sum the number of outbound connections (full-relay, block-relay, addr-fetch, manual, and feelers) and use that in place of `setConnected.size()`.\r\n\r\n> Does this PR trick the code to behave as if we are not connected to Tor (by not inserting into setConnected) even if we are connected? It looks to me that trying to solve the problem of \"cannot open many connections to Tor\" this would create another problem: \"too many connections to Tor\" - it would allow all 8 outbound to be to Tor and will not try to diversify to IPv4 (or other networks).\r\n\r\n@vasild While it's possible that we'd make all 8 of our outbound connections to Tor peers, I think this is an unlikely problem, because we limit the number of Tor connections to be a fraction of our addrman (I can't recall what that fraction is though, can someone remind us?).  I believe that an adversary looking to exploit this can really only do so for (eg) new nodes that have a relatively small addrman, by flooding such a node with onion addresses; but that attack is already available today (since we have 16 different onion netgroups, an adversary creating a zillion onion addresses to eclipse a victim will just have the ones that are in different netgroups be the ones that eclipse a peer, instead of ones in the same netgroup).\r\n\r\nSo I don't think that this PR makes that problem any worse, and we can wait until we have something like #27213 to solve this problem more generally.\r\n\r\n> I feel that we should lookup -onlynet or allow connections to Tor up to a limit to avoid \"too many connections to Tor\". \r\n\r\nI think this is unnecessary and would be counter to what we're trying to fix here.  If a node is running on both ipv4 and tor, I think we should still not require netgroup diversity across the tor peers, because such diversity is meaningless.  And as I explained above I don't think the implicit limiting of tor peers that might arise from this would be needed or desirable.\r\n\r\n> still curious to know opinions about increasing 4 bits to 5 bits in `GetGroup()`\r\n\r\nThis would double the number of addrman slots that can be used by Tor peers, right?  My off the cuff guess is that this would be undesirable, but I haven't gone back to figure out what fraction of the addrman this would be yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "RE `fCountFailure` bool: \r\n@mzumsande  \r\n> to determine the fCountFailure bool, which tells addrman to possibly deprioritize selecting an address after various failed attempts (nAttempts). As far as I can see, this logic should equally be applied to addrs from alt networks, so it might be better to leave setConnected unchanged as sdaftuar suggested?\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar\r\n> I think that bit of code that we're using in our OpenNetworkConnection() call is really trying to determine how many open connections we have, not how many distinct netgroups we're connected to? So from that perspective, I believe that line of code is written incorrectly; if we are running only on Tor and we happen to have 8 peers from the same netgroup, then presumably we are sufficiently connected that any failures to connect should be recorded in addrman.\r\n> \r\n> So I think the right change here is to modify that line to just sum the number of outbound connections (full-relay, block-relay, addr-fetch, manual, and feelers) and use that in place of setConnected.size().\r\n\r\nlooks like this code was introduced in #8065, with the primary motivation stated as preventing inaccurate incrementing of the addrman counter when a node is offline. this reinforces what I suspected from reading the code, so the suggestion to update the logic to the sum of outbound connections makes sense\r\n\r\nhowever, the OP of that post also states: \r\n> This is still somewhat incomplete protection because our outbound\r\npeers could be down but not timed out or might all be on 'local'\r\nnetworks (although the requirement for multiple netgroups helps).\r\n\r\nwhich, I don't fully understand. is this referring to a scenario where a node is only able to connect to other nodes within a local network environment, so would have frequent failures when trying to connect to the bitcoin network at large? and if this is the case, how could we distinguish this behavior pattern from a node running only on Tor and having all outbound peers from the same netgroup? \r\n\r\nRE 4 bits to 5 bits in `GetGroup()`:\r\nI agree with @mzumsande in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27369#issuecomment-1490395263 \r\n> I think there are two aspects to this that don't necessarily need be addressed at the same time:\r\n> 1. The rule not to make more than one outbound connection to a netgroup\r\n> 2. Netgroup-based bucketing in addrman\r\n>\r\n> [...]\r\n>\r\n> So, in the short term (25.0), I think that we should either temporarily revert https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/72e8ffd7f8dbf908e65da6d012ede914596737ab or do what @stratospher suggested, if that could still make it into the release.\r\n\r\nThe implications of changing from 4 to 5 bits in `GetGroup` are nuanced because of the impacts on addrman distributions, so I think we should evaluate it separately from this PR, which is currently marked for the 25.0 milestone.",

      "body": "> It looks to me that trying to solve the problem of \"cannot open many connections to Tor\" this would create another problem: \"too many connections to Tor\" - it would allow all 8 outbound to be to Tor and will not try to diversify to IPv4 (or other networks).\r\n\r\n> @vasild While it's possible that we'd make all 8 of our outbound connections to Tor peers, I think this is an unlikely problem, because we limit the number of Tor connections to be a fraction of our addrman (I can't recall what that fraction is though, can someone remind us?). I believe that an adversary looking to exploit this can really only do so for (eg) new nodes that have a relatively small addrman, by flooding such a node with onion addresses; but that attack is already available today (since we have 16 different onion netgroups, an adversary creating a zillion onion addresses to eclipse a victim will just have the ones that are in different netgroups be the ones that eclipse a peer, instead of ones in the same netgroup).\r\n\r\nI agree with sdaftuar. I think that keeping the netgroup-based limiting in the case where we can connect to more than 1 network is unnecessary, because the current AddrMan logic puts the alternative networks already at a disadvantage compared to clearnet, and the current netgroup just amplifies that by sometimes not picking an alt-net peer and then picking another clearnet peer instead.\r\nSo while having too many alt-net peers is not typically an issue in non-adverse scenarios, the netgroup restriction doesn't even really help that much in an adverse scenario of an attacker trying to eclipse us, because with 10 outbound peers and 16 netgroups, having all alt-net peers would still be possible (unless we also have manual connections!)\r\n\r\n> (I can't recall what that fraction is though, can someone remind us?)\r\n\r\nFrom a single fixed source, we can fill 16 buckets (1024 addrs) with onion addresses - that is, for example the case for inbound onion peers, because we see them as `127.0.0.1`. We can fill 64 buckets with IPv4 or IPv6 addresses from a single source.\r\n\r\nCounting multiple sources from the same alternative network, they can fill up a theoretical maximum of 256 buckets (~16k addresses) or 1/4 of the new tables I think (but due to collisions from the the modulo operations in `GetNewBucket` and `GetBucketPosition` that depend on `nKey`, it is typically more like ~200 buckets in reality).\r\nOn the other hand, multiple IPv4 and IPv6 sources can fill up all 1024 buckets in the `new` table.\r\n\r\n> which, I don't fully understand. is this referring to a scenario where a node is only able to connect to other nodes within a local network environment, so would have frequent failures when trying to connect to the bitcoin network at large? and if this is the case, how could we distinguish this behavior pattern from a node running only on Tor and having all outbound peers from the same netgroup?\r\n\r\nYes, I think that's the scenario - a temporary network failure that wouldn't apply to peers you are locally connected to. I don't think it's a problem if you are running `-onlynet=onion` because even if the peer you are connected to is within your network, you would fail to connect to it because you wouldn't be connecting to them directly but through onion routing (which would fail if the internet is down).",

      "body": "> however, the OP of that post also states:\r\n\r\n>> This is still somewhat incomplete protection because our outbound\r\npeers could be down but not timed out or might all be on 'local'\r\nnetworks (although the requirement for multiple netgroups helps).\r\n\r\n@amitiuttarwar Thanks for finding this, I hadn't thought about the issue of wanting to distinguish between local and non-local IPV4 networks for the purposes of detecting whether a node's network connectivity is down.\r\n\r\nThis means my suggestion of just summing outbound peers, rather than looking at netgroup diversity of peers, isn't great. I now think we could sum the IPV4/IPV6 entries in setConnected and add that to the total number of outbound alt-network peers (basically treating every alt-network peer as a distinct entry in setConnected), and use that for this check?\r\n\r\nEDIT: for the avoidance of doubt, I wrote a patch to implement my suggested approach [here](https://github.com/sdaftuar/bitcoin/commit/29807e1e25458a8e7ab859c6565e2f840ea38f3a).",

      "body": "Thanks a lot @sdaftuar! I've used the simplified approach in your patch! \r\n\r\n> Counting multiple sources from the same alternative network, they can fill up a theoretical maximum of 256 buckets (~16k addresses) or 1/4 of the new tables I think (but due to collisions from the the modulo operations in GetNewBucket and GetBucketPosition that depend on nKey, it is typically more like ~200 buckets in reality).\r\nOn the other hand, multiple IPv4 and IPv6 sources can fill up all 1024 buckets in the new table.\r\n\r\ntried a similar calculation for tried tables - which depends on netgroup of [tor address](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5a8bd4505687a7ec76d731b1a8249ee04d641990/src/addrman.cpp#L49)(16 group possibilities) and `hash1%8` which has 8 possibilities. that's 2^7 bucket possibilities out of 2^8 tried table buckets which is 1/2 the tried table.\r\n\r\nin an ideal theoretical ipv4 + tor scenario, the chance of all 8 outbound connections turning out to be tor would be = (50% new + 50 % tried)^8  \r\n- if src of all tor address is tor = (0.5 * 0.25 + 0.5 * 0.5)^8 = approx 0.04% (even less than this real scenario)   \r\n- if src of all tor address is ipv4 = (0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.5)^8 = approx 10% (even less than this in real scenario)\r\n\r\ni guess these are the upper bound probability of this scenario happening. it is anyways covered in the comments above related to how netgroup restrictions for Tor/I2P/CJDNS don't make much difference in adverse situations.\r\n \r\n\r\n> This would double the number of addrman slots that can be used by Tor peers, right? My off the cuff guess is that this would be undesirable, but I haven't gone back to figure out what fraction of the addrman this would be yet.\r\n\r\n> The implications of changing from 4 to 5 bits in GetGroup are nuanced because of the impacts on addrman distributions, so I think we should evaluate it separately from this PR\r\n\r\nthanks for explaining! makes sense, noticed how this would result in tor/i2p/cjdns addresses filling the entire addrman.\r\n\r\n\r\n>  I now think we could sum the IPV4/IPV6 entries in setConnected and add that to the total number of outbound alt-network peers (basically treating every alt-network peer as a distinct entry in setConnected), and use that for this check?\r\n\r\nI liked this approach!\r\n\r\n`setConnected.size() >= min(nMaxConnections - 1, 2)`\r\n\r\nsince we include manual connections in `setConnected`, something else which would change now is we'd record failure attempts when we attempt an outbound connection and are already sufficiently connected to just manual peers. i think this is desirable/aligned with the original intent of why `setConnected.size() >= min(nMaxConnections - 1, 2)` was written.\r\n\r\n`nMaxConnections` [do not include](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init.cpp#L936-L939) manual connections right? (`nMaxConnections` limit is default 125, manual connection limit is default 8 (not included in 125)). and `setConnected.size()` would include them. in a rare scenario in resource constrained systems (if ever `nMaxConnections`=2) and we only have manual connections, it's possible that we end up recording addrman failure attempts. but i guess that's alright.\r\n",

(See also these polls for fun: users https://twitter.com/jonatack/status/1629173539067527171 / bitcoin devs https://twitter.com/jonatack/status/1631717328416014336).\r\n\r\nPerhaps increasingly so, based on the increase in the number of Tor v3 and I2P peers reported by `-addrinfo` over the past year or so, now up to 15k onion and 1300 I2P peers, i.e. recently active / non-IsTerrible ones. (I2P peers in particular increased significantly recently after 2 node-in-a-box packages added support in December 2022.)",

We have had many examples over the years of asserts that people have added to our networking code for reasons that seem justifiable (along the lines of the reasons you've given), only to discover later that (usually due to an unexpected combination of code changes elsewhere) we ended up opening up a remote crash bug in deployed software that can take down the network -- in situations where we could easily have written code more defensively so that our software wouldn't crash.\n\nWe have Assume() exactly to avoid situations where a crash is worse than trying to gracefully recover, and we should err on the side of using that, particularly in networking code that could be triggered by an adversary against the whole network.",

This is because the Tor network is global (same for I2P or CJDNS). There is no such thing as \"local area network\" of Tor nodes (e.g. `10.0.0.0/24`) or localhost Tor address (like `127.0.0.1` in IPv4). If we are connected to one Tor node, it means we are not offline and can possibly connect to other Tor nodes as well.\r\n\r\nMaybe out of the scope of this PR, but would it not be better to change that logic to: \"if we are connected to at least one `CNetAddr::IsRoutable()` IPv4/6 address or at least one Tor address or at least one I2P or at least one CJDNS address, then we are not offline\"?\r\n\r\ncc @gmaxwell ",

Requiring two connections to be up (versus just 1 connection to e.g. Tor, or some other non-local ipv4/ipv6 network) is a tradeoff around how long we spend in a state where we're punishing addrman entries while we might be offline and just haven't noticed it yet, vs not punishing entries for being down when our network is up.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that most nodes on the network don't have local network peers, and so the effect of this logic for most users since it was deployed in #8065 -- requiring 2 non-local outbound connections before we start punishing addrman entries for failed attempts -- will be the same after this PR is merged.\r\n\r\nIf someone can figure out that it's more optimal for this to be 1 or 3 or some other value, I think we can pick that up in a new PR; however I'd suspect it doesn't matter too much, and that 2 is likely better than 1...",
