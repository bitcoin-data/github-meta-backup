    "body": "AssertLockHeldUnverified does the same thing LockAssertion except it:\r\n\r\n- Correctly reports file and line number where assertion fails instead of location in sync.h.\r\n\r\n- Has a simpler syntax that doesn't require declaring an unused variable name.\r\n\r\n- Should be harder to confuse with AssertLockHeld. Name should indicate it's an unverified assertion not to be preferred when the safer verified assert is available.\r\n\r\nThis also adds doxygen comments describing AssertLockHeld, AssertLockHeldUnverified, and AssertLockNotHeld macros.\r\n\r\nPR is compared with alternatives in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/AssertLockHeld-PRs",

Name should indicate it's a\n  weaker assertion not to be preferred when stronger compile time checks are\n  available.\n\nThis also adds doxygen comments describing AssertLockHeld,\nAssertLockHeldUnverified, and AssertLockNotHeld macros.",

I still think #19865 is a better approach would prefer it.\r\n\r\nI think there's two separate issues, (1) naming/behaviour for \"we can't prove to the compiler this is correct, so we'll just tell it to trust us\" and (2) \"do we need to manually add code for runtime checks that just duplicate the compile time checks?\". I think this improves (1) and #19685 is mostly about (2), and that it makes sense to keep them separate. YMMV.",

The name isn't intended to be confusing, but it is intended to discourage use. If you are writing an assert you should always favor `AssertLockHeld` over `WeaklyAssertLockHeld` and only fall back when the compiler forces you to because it can't prove that the mutex is locked in particular location.\r\n\r\n`AssertLockHeld` states that the lock is held with confidence, because the compiler can check that the statement is true at compile time. `WeaklyAssertLockHeld` makes the statement with less confidence because the compiler can't check that it is true.\r\n\r\nAny case, https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/AssertLockHeld-PRs#disadvantages-of-2a-approach has a table of possible names where other suggestions can be added\r\n",

      "body": "> It is confusing because you can't weakly call `abort()` or semi-`exit()`.\r\n\r\nThis is really funny. The function is not called WeaklyAbort or WeaklyExit! It is called WeaklyAssert! \r\n\r\nAssert in english means [to state or declare positively](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assert), \"often forcefully or aggressively\" like \"The suspect continued to assert his innocence.\" You can strongly assert something if that you are confident it is true, or you can weakly assert something if you are not confident. (Asserting has nothing to do with exiting in spoken english.)\r\n\r\nAnyway if there is another name you would prefer, please suggest it! There is a table of suggestions at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/AssertLockHeld-PRs#disadvantages-of-2a-approach. \r\n\r\nLOCK_ALREADY_HELD makes no sense to me be because:\r\n\r\n- The LOCK_ALREADY_HELD name hides the fact that it's an assert statement whose runtime behavior is identical to AssertLockHeld.\r\n- The LOCK_ALREADY_HELD name misleads you into thinking it may be a safer alternative to AssertLockHeld because it doesn't contain the word assert, when actually it is a more dangerous alternative. (Compiler can prove that AssertLockHeld will not trigger, but compiler has no way of knowing whether an LOCK_ALREADY_HELD will trigger)\r\n- I haven't seen anyone give a positive explanation why LOCK_ALREADY_HELD/AssertLockHeld is a good pairing of names for two assert statements that do the same thing, one with more compile time checking, one with less. I haven't seen any explanation of why the pairing of names makes sense for a different reason either. All I've seen are claims that other pairs of names are confusing, not that LOCK_ALREADY_HELD/AssertLockHeld is good or has any coherent logic\r\n",

If #19865 is rejected and closed, we can do a poll for which of those pairs is most popular and update this PR with the decision.\r\n\r\nI am still holding out hope for #19865, though. Personally I've found compile time thread safety checking useful, and thread sanitizer checking useful, and debug_lockorder checking useful, and even found AssertLockHeld useful before it had the EXCLUSIVE_LOCK annotation. But now that it has an annotation proving it won't trigger at runtime, I don't see personally see the utility anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> `AssertLockHeld` states that the lock is held with confidence, because the compiler can check that the statement is true at compile time. `WeaklyAssertLockHeld` makes the statement with less confidence because the compiler can't check that it is true.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of the person writing the code, this seems exactly backwards: if you're not getting compile time checks, and have disabled runtime checks in non-debug builds, you want to be *extremely* confident that the assertion is correct before relying on it in following code, so the `WeaklyAssertLockHeld` are actually the strongest assertions you're making.\r\n\r\nI think the right analogy for `LockAssertion` isn't to `LOCK` or to `AssertLockAlreadyHeld` (despite the implementation details) but actually to `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` -- in every place where we want to use `LockAssertion` we'd much rather use an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation, but for whatever reason are prevented from that. So how about `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_REQUIREMENT_SATISFIED(cs_main)` or something similar based on the function annotation we'd like to have, and changing the developer-notes recommendation along the lines of:\r\n\r\n> When unable to add an EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED annotation (eg, due to passing a lambda that uses a lock via a generic function that can't require it), use `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_REQUIREMENT_SATISFIED(cs)` at the start of the function to indicate to the compiler that lock correctness has been manually verified. In debug builds (with `DEBUG_LOCKORDER` set) this will be checked at runtime.\r\n\r\nI think that makes it pretty obvious that `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_REQUIREMENT_SATISFIED` is not the preferred thing to do when the alternative is possible, and I think having it at the start of a function minimises any potential leakage that might happen due to weird code paths and also makes it easy to move it to a compile-time-enforced annotation if that becomes possible.",

I think it's overthinking a little, but very neat, and I'm happy to use any names.\r\n\r\nAfter names are chosen, everything else in this approach is pretty simple. It does have two asserts, so it isn't quite as simple as #19865 or #19979 where there is only one assert. But it's easy to always favor the provable assert, and fall back to the unprovable one when analysis doesn't accept it. If analysis is turned off, both asserts are identical.",

You seem to believe according to your comments here and in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19979#pullrequestreview-492559322 that ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK is less preferable to NO_THREAD_SAFETY_ANALYSIS because ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK is \"extorting the compiler\".\r\n\r\nThis sounds to me like saying if a seatbelt doesn't fit you, instead of using a seatbelt extender, you should not wear a seatbelt, because using a seatbelt extender would be extorting the seatbelt.\r\n\r\nI think this PR is using ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK exactly the way it's intended to be used: to inform compiler thread analysis that a mutex is locked in cases where static analysis can't prove that it's locked. Do you believe this PR is misusing ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK? Or maybe that ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK is never acceptable to use? Why would giving the analysis (and giving developers reading the code) information be less preferable to disabling the analysis?",

      "body": "> You seem to believe ... that `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` is less preferable to `NO_THREAD_SAFETY_ANALYSIS`\r\n\r\nNo, I believe [having two assert functions] is less preferable to [one assert function + `NO_THREAD_SAFETY_ANALYSIS` in some exceptional places].\r\n\r\nOverall I think that the most important thing is to have a clean interface (whatever is exported by `sync.h`) - one that is impossible to misuse and does not require mentions in developer-notes or long comments in the code. That means having just one function to \"assert that the mutex is held\". Even if that has some limitations and in a few cases we need to use `NO_THREAD_SAFETY_ANALYSIS` or tweaks like in #19979.\r\n\r\nI think that this sole function should be tagged with [ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#assert-capability-and-assert-shared-capability) because it best describes what the function does.\r\n\r\nI think that tagging it with [EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#requires-requires-shared) is incorrect to some extent because internally the assert function does not do anything that requires holding the mutex (like accessing variables protected by that mutex). I.e. it can perform the checks correctly (no races would occur) without the mutex being held. However [EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#requires-requires-shared) provides stronger checks at compile time and also does not silence warnings in the code that follow it and also @aaronpuchert himself said it is ok to tag the assert function with [EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#requires-requires-shared), so I accept that.\r\n\r\n> I think this PR is using ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK exactly the way it's intended to be used: to inform compiler thread analysis that a mutex is locked in cases where static analysis can't prove that it's locked. Do you believe this PR is misusing ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK?\r\n\r\nNo, this PR is using `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` exactly as intended, as I say above, but it is using it on `AssertLockHeld2()` while still having `AssertLockHeld1()` tagged with another attribute. Two functions is what I think should be avoided.",

I wasn't aware of other guidance and didn't mean to conflict.\r\n\r\n> I think the only case where it's useful for virtual methods is if the parent class doesn't need the lock, but the child class does -- in that case invoking `Parent* p = new Child(); p->func();` won't trigger compile-time warnings but you could at least catch it with a runtime check. But I think that pattern probably should be considered a mistake anyway.\r\n> \r\n> As far as I know callbacks will need the `WeaklyAssertLockHeld` variant?\r\n\r\nre: \"pattern probably should be considered a mistake.\" IMO, the idea of having a compile time annotation whose only purpose at compile time is checking for the presence of a different compile-time annotation is a mistake. But given that, it makes sense to use `AssertLockHeld` instead of `WeaklyAssertLockHeld` to provide runtime checking inside a lambda annotated with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` called through a `std::function`, or inside an overridden virtual method annotated `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` called through a base method which is not annotated.\r\n\r\nDeleted the comment, though, because I'm becoming convinced these asserts are hopeless to explain in detail. As long we're are going to reject #19865 and have these ubiquitous asserts, the most useful practical advice will probably be to prefer using `AssertLockHeld` wherever possible and just fall back to `WeaklyAssertLockHeld` when the compiler gives an error you don't understand.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19918#discussion_r487719492\r\n\r\n> Maybe just drop the above paragraph as it contradicts with the developer nodes?

      "body": "> But given that, it makes sense to use `AssertLockHeld` instead of `WeaklyAssertLockHeld` to provide runtime checking inside a lambda annotated with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` called through a `std::function`\r\n\r\nBoth the current `LockAssertion` and your proposed `WeaklyAssertLockHeld` do runtime checking, so there's no advantage there.\r\n\r\nI don't think AssertLockHeld in lambdas ever makes much sense: there are two ways to use lambdas -- one where thread safety annotations work as expected, and one where they're broken because the lambda's a callback passed to an unannotated function. In the former case you're writing:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n    LOCK(cs);\r\n    [&]() EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs) { ++foo; }();\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere it's already obvious that `cs` is held when the lambda is called, and you're just adding the annotation to make the compiler happy.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case, you're writing:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n    LOCK(cs_main);\r\n    connman->ForEachNode([&](CNode* pnode) {\r\n        WeaklyAssertLockHeld(cs_main);\r\n        ...\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nbecause you can't pass the fact that `cs_main` is still held through the un-annotated `ForEachNode`. \r\n\r\n> inside an overridden virtual method annotated `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` called through a base method which is not annotated.\r\n\r\nI think that is something we should go out of our way to avoid. Either the base method should be annotated as requiring the lock, or the overriding method should acquire the lock itself -- with annotations, locking is part of the function signature, and you shouldn't change the signature when overriding a method. We don't have any code like this now, and I don't think there's any reason ever to, so I'm not sure it's worth addressing it explicitly, but if we are, better to discourage it outright.\r\n",

      "body": "> Note that ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK has slightly weird scoping behaviour [...]\r\n\r\nThis is unrelated to scopes, the capability is assumed to be held after the assertion, regardless of whether we leave any scopes. (Think about it, there is no destructor for the assertion, so why would the scope ending change anything?)\r\n\r\nThis analysis works on the source-level CFG. We can inspect this by passing `--analyze -Xanalyzer -analyzer-checker=debug.DumpCFG` to Clang. For the first example (using the [vocabulary from the documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#mutex-h)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n [B4 (ENTRY)]\r\n   Succs (1): B3\r\n\r\n [B1]\r\n   1: x\r\n   2: ++[B1.1]\r\n   Preds (2): B2 B3(Unreachable)\r\n   Succs (1): B0\r\n\r\n [B2]\r\n   1: m\r\n   2: [B2.1].AssertHeld\r\n   3: [B2.2]()\r\n   Preds (1): B3\r\n   Succs (1): B1\r\n\r\n [B3]\r\n   1: 1\r\n   2: [B3.1] (ImplicitCastExpr, IntegralToBoolean, _Bool)\r\n   T: if [B3.2]\r\n   Preds (1): B4\r\n   Succs (2): B2 B1(Unreachable)\r\n\r\n [B0 (EXIT)]\r\n   Preds (1): B1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `if` is in `B3` and branches on a compile-time constant, thus we see that the branch to `B1` (where the increment happens) is unreachable. In your second example the branch condition is no longer a compile-time constant. (Try adding `const` or `constexpr`, then it should work.)\r\n\r\n> This is because `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` tells the compiler we are going to check, but we actually don't check (in non-debug build).\r\n\r\nUsing `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` even though you don't always check is fine. It would be strange if it wasn't, because that's how the standard [assert](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert) behaves.\r\n\r\n> Maybe remove `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` in non-debug builds, or at least clearly explain in the comment the dangers of using this.\r\n\r\nHaving static analysis depend on the build profile doesn't really make sense IMO. If you don't have the same annotations in all profiles you're just going to make your life harder.",
