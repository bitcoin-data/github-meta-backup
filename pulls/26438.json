If so, what are they?\r\n\r\n * Is it reasonable to enforce BIP 125's rbf rules on all transactions, if those rules themselves are not always incentive compatible?\r\n\r\n * If someone were to propose a command line option that breaks v3 transaction relay in the future, is there a logical basis for opposing that which is consistent with moving towards fullrbf now?\r\n",

      "body": "Concept ACK. Admittedly, I haven't been following this issue very closely, but wow, that mailing list post was very persuasive. The analogy between the `-mempoolfullrbf` flag and a hypothetical `-disable_v3_transaction_enforcement` flag to me was the most compelling part, as well as the framing:\r\n\r\n> Relay has only ever been a best-efforts concept, where we carve out a small subset of the entire transaction universe for which we try to optimize propagation.\r\n\r\nAdding options for different nodes to see different subsets of the transaction universe seems something we would really want to avoid unless the options provide very compelling benefits. And given limitations of `-mempoolfullrbf` described in footnote 3, the benefits it provides seem scant compared to the cost and complexity having to design for multiple mempool policies on the same network going forward.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEDIT 2022-11-07: After discussion below I still support main idea behind the PR: that adding mempool options which cause different nodes to have different views of transactions could be bad in the long term for transaction propagation and network reliability and complexity of the mempool implementation. So it would be bad to add options that don't have practical individual use cases and let them accumulate over time.\r\n\r\nBut I'd also support postponing this PR, and letting people experiment with the option until we can see whether it gains usage or has any practical effect at all. I just think in the long term, we should streamline options that make the network behave less homogeneously and don't have useful local behavior.",

      "body": "> Full RBF offers 2 benefits:\r\n> \r\n> * Better security for coinjoin and multi party contracts which is hard to fix without users trying full RBF using this option\r\n\r\nAs discussed in the mailing list thread, the security problem with a coinjoin protocol/multiparty funded transaction protocol that Antoine described can still occur even if fullrbf were the norm.  So I believe this to be false (in the sense that I don't think @ariard or @instagibbs, who seem most familiar with the protocol being described, think the problem would be solved with fullrbf -- if I'm misunderstanding that viewpoint though I would welcome being corrected).\r\n\r\n> * Provide another policy option for users to replace transactions\r\n\r\n\"Providing another policy option\" is a circular reason.  The question I'm trying to get at is: what harm is there to the network from some users choosing to opt their transactions out of RBF?  The example Antoine gave would be in that category if fullrbf actually solved the problem he described, but since it doesn't seem to solve the problem I'm looking for other examples.  \r\n\r\n> > Is it reasonable to enforce BIP 125's rbf rules on all transactions, if those rules themselves are not always incentive compatible?\r\n> \r\n> Its reasonable to try and collect some insights based on usage. This could be used to improve things in future.\r\n\r\nWe have had 7 years to gain insights based on usage.  Something like 20-30% of all transactions opt-in already, I think?  I don't think we're going to learn anything more that we can't already learn from looking at current usage patterns.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps another way of phrasing this argument is, if you're going to advocate for fullrbf because non-replacement is not incentive compatible, then you should also be able to argue that our fullrbf policy is incentive compatible.  And I'm pointing out that fullrbf as it exists in master (when this `mempoolfullrbf` flag is enabled) is not incentive compatible in some obvious situations.  So it seems to me that an incentive compatibility argument cuts both ways, and those arguing that non-replacement is bad should implement an incentive compatible set of RBF rules first, before we enforce that on all transactions.\r\n\r\n> > If someone were to propose a command line option that breaks v3 transaction relay in the future, is there a logical basis for opposing that which is consistent with moving towards fullrbf now?\r\n> \r\n> I do not understand this question, v3 tx relay is still being discussed afaik and not sure how it's related to an option to use full RBF as Gloria as mentioned in [this](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html) email:\r\n\r\nIf you read my full email and still do not understand my question then I'm not sure I can explain this any better here, but I tried to argue that the restriction on not allowing replacements of non-rbf-signaling transactions is similar in concept to a restriction to not allow arbitrary children of a v3 transaction, in the v3 transaction relay proposal that is being advanced.  I like the v3 proposal, and I think we should pursue it, and I worry that setting a precedent of breaking a policy for no network benefit could be used in the future to interfere with v3 down the road, because many of the same arguments would seem to apply.\r\n\r\nSo I'm looking for people who think that (a) the v3 transaction policy proposal is good and (b) that fullrbf is good to explain how those can be mutually compatible viewpoints, because from how I think about both of these issues, I'm unable to justify supporting fullrbf right now (given my understanding of current usage patterns on the network, where there seems to be little demand for transactions that opt-out of replacement under BIP 125 being doublespent) without also justifying offering knobs to break v3 in the future, which I would be opposed to doing.",

If different mempools have different policies, it seems like it would be a lot harder to evaluate any one policy or for the network to be reliable and improve over time.",

      "body": "> > And I'm pointing out that fullrbf as it exists in master (when this mempoolfullrbf flag is enabled) is not incentive compatible in some obvious situations.\r\n> \r\n> \"I want to steal from 0-conf merchants\" is the \"use-case\" you're ignoring, and where the argument falls apart imo. It's the whole reason we're having this debate, it's that merchants are scared about it. If people didn't believe it was incentive compatible, we wouldn't be having this conversation at all.\r\n\r\nI completely agree that the fullrbf policy currently in master is incentive compatible enough to help people steal from 0-conf merchants.  \r\n\r\nThe issue with incentive compatibility that I was trying to bring up here is that if you look at our rbf policy as a whole, you'd find problems with its design (namely, the lack of comparison between the ancestor feerate of an incoming transaction, and the actual feerates of all the transactions that would be evicted, can mean that we'd evict transactions that would be mined in the next block in favor of a transaction that may not be mined for a long time).  So in that sense, adopting fullrbf is trading one set of incentive compatibility problems for another.  It's not like we have a policy A that is so perfectly designed and  incentive compatible on the one hand, and this irrational non-replacement policy B on the other hand, and we're just trying to move everyone who is suffering in the backwards B world into the enlightened A world.  Instead, A itself has some good things about it, and it has some issues, and B has some good things about it, and some issues of its own.  \r\n\r\nSo if you put aside the question of 0-conf and just tried to look at the policies on their face, it's hard to argue that this is a strict improvement over giving people a choice of which policy regime to opt into.\r\n\r\n> edit: and for anyone reading I'm completely against stealing from merchants, and personally will not be working towards fullrbf-default-on efforts because of lack of ethical use-cases.\r\n\r\nI think this gets at the fundamental issue, which I think we both largely agree on, which is that the main use case of fullrbf is helping users steal from 0-conf merchants.  It's not that an opt-in non-replacement policy is fundamentally bad; it's just that businesses offering 0-conf services seem to be offering a reason to subvert the very policy on which they (predominantly) rely.\r\n\r\n> Ostensibly, we are trying to allow people to bid fees for inclusion to blocks. Excluding people from _bidding against themselves_ is clearly different than V3 type patterns which are for making bidding a robust process.\r\n\r\nI just want to make sure that no subtlety in my argument here was overlooked -- I do think that the v3 transaction proposal, as an opt-in set of restrictions on certain transactions to support a particular use case, makes sense.  I also think that when applied to the use cases we have in mind, the v3 proposal should make it easier for the best transactions to propagate to miners.  \r\n\r\nI would also argue that a non-replacement policy, when used correctly, can also help miners get the best transactions, if the transaction participants are better able to coordinate when to use CPFP and when not to.  The pinning issues with RBF highlight this issue exactly (wouldn't it make sense for wallets to be more willing to spend unconfirmed outputs from non-signaling incoming transactions and just fee bump them appropriately? with rbf transactions, pinning and the greater chance of having your child transaction becoming invalid make this messier).\r\n\r\nMy comparison of v3 to non-replacement transactions is in the use cases that we do not foresee, which might in turn create incentives that could be argued would theoretically make the v3 ruleset not incentive compatible.  This is essentially how I see 0-conf merchants' use of non-replacement transactions; they have turned a neutral policy into something that theoretically may not be incentive compatible, by creating an incentive to break it.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm arguing though is that we should wait to see evidence that there are actually transactions being broadcast and mined that subvert the policy, and not just postulate that there are reasons for the policy to be subverted and therefore we should move to break it prematurely.  This is because there may be countering reasons why the policy isn't being subverted (perhaps because people are mostly honest), and I don't think it's great to break a theoretically useful policy (non-replacement) without a really good reason. \r\n\r\nIn the analogy to v3 transactions, a similar scenario could occur if lots of non-lightning services start using v3 transactions for reasons that (likely) wouldn't make any sense, creating theoretical demand for more child transactions for fee bumping and access to unconfirmed coins.  I would hope that we would try to support the v3 use case by just communicating that this is a bad idea and not the intent of the policy, and wait until we were to actually see evidence of transactions being relayed and mined that violate the policy, rather than offer tools to subvert the policy prematurely just because of a theoretical incentive compatibility problem.",

      "body": "Reading the reasoning  on the mailing post, I think there are more long-term implications in the suggestion of adopting the transaction-relay policy of non-interfering use cases to what the network supposes. Especially the concern we might create mining income asymmetries due to unequal access to transactions flows bypassing policies, in a future where fees should substantially contribute to block reward. Beyond, policy design miner-incentive misalignement could create \"hidden\" security risks for protocols like Lightning, leading to sudden wreckage (e.g miner-bribing contract to ignore version=3 policy). I think a more complete layout of those implications should be pursued on the mailing list. To be clear, I'm not saying a transaction-relay philosophy \"to each use-case, a set of policy rules\" AFAIU  isn't a reasonable path forward, just we should rather understand better the implications. \r\n\r\nAnswering on the direct questions, as argued multiple times, full-rbf removes one DoS concern for multi-party transactions flows. The solution is satisfying in the sense, if full-rbf is deployed on the majority of the network, a participant to a coinjoin transaction can expect the target transaction, if it offers a better fee in the definition of BIP125 to propagate to the miners. The coinjoin protocol execution doesn't have to halt, and it can keep progressing forward as long as you have fee-bumping reserves available to compete with blockspace demand >\r\n\r\n>   As discussed in the mailing list thread, the security problem with a coinjoin protocol/multiparty funded transaction protocol that Antoine described can still occur even if fullrbf were the norm.\r\n\r\nHowever, reading this statement, I'm not sure if we all think about the same success/failure terms for the security problem raised ? The arguments why the solution is not satisfying are not clear to me.\r\n\r\nAnother more distant concern (yet to be backed up by more research), full-rbf removes a mass mempool-partitioning vector, where an attacker could partition all the network mempools states and from then alter fee-estimation or leverage this as a building block for advanced pinning (cf. the last attack scenario [0]). Of course, partitioning mempools states due to policy difference is always a potential outcome (e.g Taproot transactions between upgraded and non-upgrade nodes), however I wonder what level of difficulty and cost we should burden on an attacker, or consider this as inevitable.\r\n\r\nOn the second question, if we had a stronger model of what we mean by incentive-compatible, rather to evaluate any rule on a binary approach (i.e either compatible or not), we could adopt a quantitative approach. Each policy rule impact could be measured in deviation from an \"ideal\" mining income (as we're doing in cryptanalysis where we deviate from the perfect security of the one-time pad) and to be pondered with other dimensions like privacy or full-node DoS surface increased. If we had a consistent modeling of miner incentive-compatibility that we'll agree on, we could make legible statement if enforcing BIP125 rules on all transactions or not is a improvement. One could argue today that the non-replacement policy regime as expected by zeroconf operators is \"incentive-compatible\" in the sense it favors Bitcoin adoption as a payment system, as such increase fees volume (all depends how you construct your model, and what variables you select or not). \r\n\r\nOn the last question, if someone proposes a command line option that breaks v3 transaction relay in the future, I think I would be in favor of such change. I could understand a full-node operator which is not partaking in Lightning neither interested to have compelling fee-estimation, and willing to reduce the CPU DoS surface of a low-performance node. Any transaction-relay rules or mempool acceptance rules, even wisely designed and reviewed, increases the bug surface of a full-node, a risk a node operator could choose to not burden with.  \r\n\r\n[0]  https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-June/018011.html  ",

I understand that you think two things: (a) zeroconf is antithetical to Bitcoin and should be eliminated, and (b) this PR (or the one that introduced `-mempoolfullrbf`) does not affect the safety of zeroconf in a material way, because it's inherently dangerous.\r\n\r\nI think I can accept both of those statements as your position, but if they are both true, why would you care strongly whether this PR is merged or not?  Why does anyone need the ability to enable fullrbf in the way that `-mempoolfullrbf` does, if not to improve the ability to steal from zeroconf merchants?  I'd like to understand if there's another use case for the fullrbf flag that I'm missing.",

I'd like to understand if there's another case for the fullrbf flag that I'm missing.\n\nFirst of all, people do on occasion send non-opt-in-signalling transactions\nthat need to be fee-bumped to get mined in a reasonable amount of time.\nSimilarly, it's perfectly valid to try to cancel a transaction sent in error,\nregardless of opt-in status. That alone is more than enough reason to support\nfull-rbf. The need to signal opt-in status is also of course a privacy harm.\nAgain, that's enough reason to support full-rbf.\n\nMore generally, zeroconf is dangerous.

In conjunction with `addnode` however it does make it much easier for people to opt-in to effective full-rbf relay policy for their own nodes, regardless of what % of nodes choose to run it. For example, a friend of mine told me that he was waiting for v24.0 to be released to run full-rbf, because his node was on Umbrel, and installing a custom patch would be annoying; he was going to peer with another full-rbf node to ensure propagation worked.\n\nAs for miners, again, if they _only_ use the `mempoolfullrbf=1` option it's symbolic until a non-trivial percentage of nodes enable it. But again, by using `addnode` to connect to other full-rbf nodes, it will get full-rbf replacements mined even with very little hash power running it.\n\nI and others are currently running a dozen or so nodes that have both full-rbf enabled, and preferential peering via a full-rbf service bit. So finding a node to peer with to get tx propagation to work reliably isn't too hard.\n\ntl;dr: if people choose too, they can use `mempoolfullrbf` to make a genuine difference.

If Core doesn't explicitly allow full RBF transactions in its mempool, there will be other non-Core mempools or some sort of black market forming.\r\n\r\nSo either we formalize full RBF, which is preferable, or it will arise out-of-band.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give zero-confs businesses some grace period, shipping `mempoolfullrbf` defaulting to false seems reasonable.

That said, this wouldn't be safe if there are additional bug fixes in future release candidates, and running release candidates in production is not a good idea in general.\r\n\r\nThe debate around RBF has been going on for almost a decade. I think it can wait a few more months for a point release. We can determine if your bounty program worked out (i.e. created a fait accompli) through something like [miningpool.observer](https://miningpool.observer).",

As @sdaftuar points out in his mailinglist post, `-mempoolfullrbf` really just means \"BIP 125 without the signal\". Without also getting rid of other BIP 125 constraints, we leave at least some pinning attacks unaddressed. So it's not a huge improvement for Lightning and other multi-party protocols, not an improvement for those who already signal BIP 125 by default. So imo the change is not useful enough to harm even \"a tiny handful of people\".\r\n\r\nIt would be even more confusing to have \"full rbf\" available now and \"maximal rbf\" later. Maybe it turns out we can't come up with a \"maximal RBF\" that is meaningfully more incentive compatible than \"full rbf\", but I think this should be explored a bit more.\r\n\r\nI also agree with @ajtowns that the general issue of divergent mempool policies is worth thinking through more. Since `-mempoolfullrbf` doesn't seem to solve any urgent problem, it seems reasonable to take more time to discuss things. ",

      "body": "> First of all, people do on occasion send non-opt-in-signalling transactions\r\nthat need to be fee-bumped to get mined in a reasonable amount of time.\r\nSimilarly, it's perfectly valid to try to cancel a transaction sent in error,\r\nregardless of opt-in status. [...] The need to signal opt-in status is also of course a privacy harm.\r\n\r\n@petertodd Thanks for providing these examples; I think they’re worth consideration and reviewers should decide how compelling they are. \r\n\r\n> What you are doing here with this pull-req is\r\npolitics: you're trying to take away an option in an attempt to make it\r\ninconvenient enough for miners and other users that this dangerous feature\r\ncontinues to live on. \r\n\r\nThis is either poor phrasing or you have misunderstood my motivation: I have no intent with this PR to keep zeroconf going, and I am not arguing that zeroconf is a good or safe practice for the network.  It appears from Antoine’s recent mailing list post that he may also misunderstand me as somehow trying to protect zeroconf merchants or their business practices, so I will try to clarify my views here because that is not my interest at all.\r\n\r\nLet me start by saying that I think I mostly share your views that zeroconf – ie selling a product in an irrevocable way prior to a transaction having any confirmations – should not be relied upon for anything of material value. It seems to me that engaging in a practice like that is asking for trouble, and as I have thought about this issue in recent weeks it is unfortunate that zeroconf merchants exist, as their existence appears to be a lightning rod that attracts interest to pushing for fullrbf (which I now view as a protocol development mistake, at least at this time).\r\n\r\nBecause I share your view, I’m surprised that zeroconf services appear to still be in operation, and it further makes me wonder if there’s anything that we can do at the protocol level that would affect the existence of those operations.  Perhaps the services that exist today only engage in these practices in situations where theft could be detected and deterred via off-chain mechanisms (and hence, it may not be “zeroconf” in the sense I defined it above, if there is recourse in the event the transaction doesn’t confirm). If so, then even if such practices are bad for Bitcoin (which I think is hard to say without looking at concrete examples of merchant behavior), they may not go away in a fullrbf world either.\r\n\r\nIf non-replacement were something that I believed only existed to support zeroconf merchants, I would have stayed out of this debate.  However, I realized that what we are actually doing here is taking our opt-in non-replacement policy regime and deciding to get rid of it.  And it occurred to me that this is a policy that is independent of zeroconf practices – which are an outside-of-the-protocol merchant behavior, which we may be able to influence but not definitively eliminate – and moreover that non-replacement is actually a useful idea on its face.  In fact it’s such a useful idea that I think I’d propose it or something like it in the future, if we were in a fullrbf world with the rbf policies we have today – but not for anything that has to do with zeroconf merchant practices, which seem insecure regardless of whether we have a non-replacement policy.\r\n\r\nSince I perhaps didn’t explain this thoroughly in my mailing list post, I will expand on it here.  The RBF rules we have today are clumsy, and I have personally had countless discussions over the years with other developers about how to improve on them, primarily due to the pinning issues that exist and the incentive compatibility considerations that come with it.  On top of that, transaction chains themselves are hard to reason about in the context of coming up with optimal transaction selection for a miner and preventing mempool DoS in various ways (these are also topics I have substantial experience working on for this project).  In thinking about all this, one conclusion I’ve reached is that Bitcoin’s transaction relay protocol and user behavior would likely have been far better from the start if the expectation was that the network wouldn’t generally relay transactions with unconfirmed parents – a position that I think is easy to justify if you look at the various anti-DoS rules we’ve put in place over the last 10 years which have generally served to limit the transactions which get relayed on the network, in comparison to what early versions of the software supported.\r\n\r\nFrom a blank slate/initial policy of never allowing transactions with unconfirmed parents, relaxing that policy in specific situations to support narrow use cases which can be easily reasoned about would have been much better than the free-for-all we have now (where arbitrary transaction chains topologies are permitted, with the only limits being on certain kinds of package size and count).\r\n\r\nIn such a world, there would be a meaningful difference between transactions that can be replaced via feerate considerations, and transactions that the sender does not intend to replace.  In the latter case, CPFP is a far more reasonable strategy than in the former, because the recipient who chains a transaction has greater reason to believe that they are doing something helpful rather than harmful by creating the chained transaction which feebumps the parent (and not just pinning the transaction and irritating the sender, or creating a transaction that will disappear when the parent is replaced and need to be reissued, or creating a DoS vector for the network by relaying something that will need to be evicted later – which is the central issue that creates the pinning consideration in the first place).\r\n\r\nNow I get that we aren’t starting from a blank slate; I wanted to take everyone through that thought experiment to try to understand that non-replacement is not intrinsically evil. Note that the CPFP use case I describe is completely benign, provided that the wallet engaging in it can reasonably handle the (likely rare, but certainly possible) situations where the first transaction doesn’t confirm for some reason (eg by being able to reissue a payment if needed).\r\n\r\nMaybe you think improved CPFP policy is not compelling; that is fine and we can debate and perhaps disagree.  Or, perhaps the CPFP signal can still be in place on a network where the non-replacement is not enforced; that is hard for me to say without a lot more thought.\r\n\r\nIf you think about the policy regimes we have now or are currently discussing: (1) we have a way to opt-out of RBF (but still have lots of child transactions), (2) we have a way to opt-in to RBF (and still have lots of child transactions), and after the v3 proposal is deployed we will also have (3) a way to be able to opt-in to RBF and have just 1 child transaction (which itself will be limited).  In some ways option (2) is the least well-designed option, in that the transaction graph complexities interact with the replacement rules in ways that result in outcomes that are both suboptimal for wallets and also sometimes incentive incompatible for miners, and it would make more sense to have option (2) restrict the child transaction graph further than it does today (but perhaps not so limited as option (3) will be, which is really tailored to a single use-case). If that were a road we go down, then that would make (1) a more compelling option to have available as a policy on the network to facilitate use cases that involve lots of child transactions, and if we eliminate (1) now I fear that any attempt to bring it back in the future will fail due to concerns about zeroconf merchants – something outside our control as protocol developers.\r\n\r\nAnd as I said on the mailing list, I also fear that eliminating (1) for the reasons given could also apply to eliminating (3) in the future.  If you look at the reasons you gave above for not having (1) as a policy, I think at least two of them easily apply to the v3 transaction proposal – the consequences of users making mistakes and inadvertently using version 3 transactions when they intended to chain multiple children, and the privacy implications of another distinguished transaction type.  Now I think we have good answers to those objections – namely that no one should be using v3 transactions unless they mean to – but if your arguments are found to be compelling in this case, I fear that the v3 policy design may be subverted in the future and the efforts we’re putting in now are a waste of time.\r\n\r\n— \r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be helpful to reviewers for me to explain what I think some of the best reasons to oppose this PR would be, in the interests of advancing the debate:\r\n\r\n1) Complexity. If it’s more complex for our mempool policy code to support both rbf and non-rbf transactions, then that might be a good reason to merge the two into one regime (this could be either due to code complexity or logical complexity of the policies interact).\r\n2) If you believe that this PR will be seen as a misguided endorsement of zeroconf then you might find that to be a compelling reason to reject this, even if you understood what I’m trying to actually get at here with my arguments about relay design philosophy.  Even though endorsing zeroconf is not my intention, I guess this is probably an issue that would need to be addressed, given the apparent lack of understanding here already and the lengthy explanations I have had to write up!\r\n3) The level of user/miner interest in having a knob to enable fullrbf may be so high that it’s absurd we don’t make the simple option available given what a simple code change it is to support, and the non-consensus nature of the option. (I think knobs should have intended use cases, so while I’m sympathetic to the principle here, I think weighing this comes down to deciding how important the fullrbf use case is compared to the alternative.)\r\n4) The relative weighting of the other use cases that have been given for fullrbf, compared with my argument for the CPFP use case being strongest with non-replacement – reviewers can decide for themselves which use cases seem more compelling.\r\n",

But, it turns out that this approach to full RBF [isn't sufficient](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021125.html) to make multi-party funded transactions secure against the types of pinning attacks. Furthermore specific objections have since been raised [[ref]](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021007.html) [[ref]](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021056.html). If we'd known that this approach didn't work for its intended use case earlier, I don't think #25353 would (or should) have been merged; so until we can fix the code/policy to achieve what it was originally intended to achieve, I think we should revert the change.",

It is up to the individual node to decide. \n\nSo, it seems this kind of thing should be part of a superficial config for both nodes and wallets, not something that requires recompiling, as such a setting may need to be changed automatically or responsively.\n\nWe should not inject bias for any particular preference as default, but we probably do need to start with some sort of policy, so this should be set to current status quo consensus, not a new agenda for rbf to become a first-class default type. \n\nAll of this is not to mention the many things I could say that are great about merchants being able to opt in to 0conf, and that the risks there are currently very manageable and exposure can easily be limited to provide great value to merchants and consumers. \n\nWe can have rbf and 0conf coexisting, well, we already do! So let's be thoughtful and address the overall design intelligently and without passively aggressing or deciding for users in conflict with current consensus. Thanks! ",

I'm of the view that if a significant subset of users want to change from default policy there shouldn't be roadblocks (e.g. already merged options removed) constructed to prevent them from doing so. Especially when there doesn't appear to perfect consensus on what the default should be. I get that the PR author doesn't think the current choice presented to users is the optimal one long term.\r\n\r\nDespite some opposition (that I personally consider short term thinking) I thought turning this option on by default and considering removing it afterwards was the best long term roadmap. This seems like a last minute screeching u-turn to me but I guess I have to have faith that this truly does hinder plans for the long term v3 transaction proposal.

      "body": "Among all these strong and soft feelings, let me say I understand and respect both points of view.\r\n\r\nStory: Another thing is that Bitcoin was for me always very peaceful because I could sleep well knowing that when a valid final (non-RBF) transaction is in the network, it will get mined eventually. And I had transactions in the mempool for half a year in 2020, all sent from my own UTXOs and 1sat/vB fee. I do not want to have a future option to take back my word which I gave (to my younger self) in the past. My nodes keep rebroadcasting all transactions from the mempool and have much higher limits, so none of them will be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThose transactions which opt-in to RBF can be replaced. That's fine. But that is opt-in. Something I learned is very important for Bitcoin. Making all the wallets opt-in to RBF by default is fine for me as long as I can still turn it off and it will be understood by network.\r\n\r\nOpt-in RBF is there already. No coding needed. Possibility to send a non-RBF transaction is there as well. But when it gets removed, I think that sooner or later there may arise a need for this functionality and it will need to be implemented anew.\r\n\r\nSo my point is we are showing something (some best-practices) to further generations. And despite something is technically possible (the miner can run a full-RBF node which I do not know about for example, but that's fine, it's not what everyone does and what I would expect since my transactions are not sent straight to any particular miner, but rather the peers), e.g. replacing the transaction although it does not opt-in to RBF, it does not have to be advertised. And when someone mentions sybil attacks — you only need one node which tells the truth.\r\n\r\nKeep your opinions. Please do not use \"strong\" words. Let the discussion flow.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.\r\n\r\nAs for me and my household, ACK 4a40866 (this was my original thinking)\r\n\r\nUPDATE: After reading it all and thinking it through, I have **changed** my **opinion to NACK** and setting my nodes to run `mempoolfullrbf=1` in order to test if it does not pose any performance issues (old hardware here).",

I'd like to express why my general view of this _direction_ is a NACK. As I see it, the root issue isn't the rbf itself, but the merchants/users doing 0-conf transactions. The 0-conf transaction pattern, as I understand it, works under a new assumption that lives on the social layer rather than in the system itself. I don't believe the Bitcoin node software should add layers of protection for the users that are based on social assumptions. A switch to fullrbf may be inevitable because the nature of the protocol is such that double-spending a transaction that's not protected by energy requires no energy cost. We can't change this by hiding the UI buttons/commands or by adding new social assumptions i.e. the person has no communication channel with the miners. Eventually, these communication channels will exist because it will be profitable. As I see it, a transaction floating in the mempool is just a sequence of bits like any other bits on the internet. It's only when these become a part of the ledger that they get any kind of meaningful double-spend protection - until then, they're unsafe by definition. While I see the temptation to remove the UI buttons, I fear the use of such unsafe methods (or rather, relying on unsafe social assumptions) will become more adopted and eventually exploited on a great scale.\r\n\r\nThat said, it may be a good practice to ACK this and revert the code if the main objective was not fulfilled. Making rbf as simple as possible is in my opinion slightly more important than good practices because it comes with great benefits already mentioned above and, more importantly, it keeps the Bitcoin software free from encouraging the use of unsafe social assumptions. Full-rbf seems like a natural fit for the protocol because it's inline with its objective/trustless nature. Thanks for reading.\r\n\r\nTLDR; NACK unless rbf is re-added due to other benefits.",

Is there a list of cases somewhere? I think it would help the argument.\r\n\r\n* **Mining pools** already have the technical expertise to do full RBF.\r\n* Most **relays** wouldn't enable full RBF until it's on by default. If anything, zero-conf accepting merchants probably would be better off, not worse if relays were all full-RBF.

I might be able to dig up the messages in question and ask. But I wouldn't be surprised if this is all long gone.\r\n\r\nAnyway, based on the fact that ATM's and in-person exchanges don't offer zeroconf anymore without good AML/KYC (at least in my experience across many countries), I think we can be confident that trying has lead to losses. It's obviously convenient to do so. But the fact is, they don't.",

Though in practice this would not be practical for the average node operators.\r\n\r\nI concur with @petertodd that it's a great feature and enhances user experience and privacy to be able to cancel transactions while in mempool, regardless of opt-in status.\r\nSimilarly, fee-bumping during mempool congestion is great.

Taking this option away makes it clear that we are so concerned about zeroconf, that we can't even allow people to choose to run fullrbf.\n\nTell me, what other options do you want us to take away?

      "body": "I have been running patched bitcoinds with a one-line change to enable full-RBF for multiple years.\r\nI operate several electrum servers, one of which is very popular and has hundreds of txs broadcast/day for years (actually 8000 tx/day for the past few months, some large service probably started using it to broadcast their txs). All servers are backed by patched bitcoinds (with the rbf opt-out commented out in validation.cpp).\r\n\r\n> If any reviewers are unconvinced by my rationale, I'd appreciate answers to the questions I laid out at the end of that email:\r\n> - Does fullrbf offer any benefits other than breaking zeroconf business practices? If so, what are they?\r\n\r\nThe reason I started to patch out the opt-out, is essentially what @greenaddress describes:\r\n> Multiple purposes I would say. As a wallet sender I want to be able to replace a transaction made in error as well as bump the fee in a congested situation regardless of if the user had the hindsight to set the rbf flag (especially since nodes and miners can ignore said flag, pretty useless)\r\n\r\nEvery time there is a mempool congestion for a significant amount of time (several weeks or more), users start flooding the forums/reddit/github/irc asking about stuck transactions. They are told they can use CPFP or RBF, or \"transaction accelerators\" in the past, or just to wait it out. If there is no change output, they might not be able to CPFP, and they can only RBF bump the fee if opt-in RBF was signalled. We had lots and lots of these \"support requests\" in the `#electrum` IRC channel, and on github (also on other platforms but these are where I spend my time). End of 2017, and more recently spring of 2021 there were remarkably long periods of mempool congestions.\r\n\r\nWe've had many users who created a tx using some other wallet which did not signal RBF, paying a low fee, freaking out about their tx being \"stuck\", finding guides how to CPFP/RBF in electrum, who then downloaded electrum only to find CPFP needs an is-mine output and RBF requires having opted-in to signalling originally. The only option seemingly left to these users were to wait it out. After experiencing these mempool congestions a few times, I figured I could just patch my node and give users a chance. \r\n\r\nIn particular, during the spring 2021 mempool congestion I was ready. To the self-selecting few who went to the trouble of coming to IRC and asking why the Electrum GUI does not let them \"increase the fee\" of their tx, I would explain how to configure Electrum to create a conflicting tx and to connect to my electrum server and broadcast there.\r\nAt the time that server was using the default `maxconnections=125`, always saturating it. These days I set higher limits and have more incoming connections. I think I helped four users to attempt an RBF, to either increase the fee or double-spend - merchant invoices have timeouts often not designed with a full mempool and the user lowballing the fee in mind. In two of the four cases, the replacement transaction got mined.\r\n\r\nAlso during spring 2021, I opened multiple lightning channels and was trying not to overpay in fees. One of my funding txs, which lacked a change output, got \"stuck\" in the mempool, and it did not signal RBF. I had to double-spend it or risk losing the coins: if too much time passes the remote node deletes the channel and if it gets mined after that, the money can only be recovered using manual cooperation between the channel counterparties. [0] This was around the time https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/839 got merged into the BOLTs - not yet implemented on most nodes so I could not even be certain how much time I have. I created a replacement tx to double-spend the funding and broadcast it on the patched electrum server. It worked: one of the replacement txs got mined (I kept bumping the fee).\r\n\r\nOverall IIRC my score is 3 out of 5 successful replacements of non-signalling txs. The ones that got mined on average took ~100 blocks - they were paying high next block fees and were at the top of the mempool (at least in the mempools they were accepted into!).\r\n\r\nSo that's my use case. Helping unlucky users to get their tx confirmed before an invoice expires, or double-spend after the invoice had already expired, or to fix my own mistakes.\r\n\r\nWhether the `-mempoolfullrbf` config parameter is kept or removed, it has little effect on me, the difference is whether or not I have to keep rebasing my trivial one-liner patch on every release. I already updated one of my nodes to run 24.0rc2 and to use `-mempoolfullrbf`, but I can always just go back to applying a patch.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[0]: (EDIT) to clarify, the first commitment transaction can be used to unilaterally close the channel after the funding tx gets mined, however without anchor outputs that still assumes the feerate had been set to high enough to get mined",

While not that common, during high fees this is an obvious lifesaver and we can't assume fees will always be low.\r\n\r\n> Whether the -mempoolfullrbf config parameter is kept or removed, it has little effect on me, the difference is whether or not I have to keep rebasing my trivial one-liner patch on every release. I already updated one of my nodes to run 24.0rc2 and to use -mempoolfullrbf, but I can always just go back to applying a patch.\r\n\r\nI'll also point out that in this type of use-case - a use-case that may happen in an emergency - it's definitely safer when those that need full-rbf can simply enable a flag rather than have to figure out what line to modify and how to recompile.",

It appears from Antoine’s recent mailing list post that he may also misunderstand me as somehow trying to protect zeroconf merchants or their business practices, so I will try to clarify my views here because that is not my interest at all.\r\n\r\nWhat your intent happens to be is not relevant. What is relevant is the effect of this proposed pull-req. This PR is a step towards keeping zeroconf going. As is the v24.0-only alternative: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26456\r\n\r\nThe status quo is v24.0 is getting released with `mempoolfullrbf`. Changing that status quo keeps zeroconf going. Which as I point out in the discussion around https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26456, is particularly harmful now that John Carvallo is claiming his company is working to provide *new* zeroconf acceptance tools.\r\n\r\n> Since I perhaps didn’t explain this thoroughly in my mailing list post, I will expand on it here. The RBF rules we have today are clumsy, and I have personally had countless discussions over the years with other developers about how to improve on them, primarily due to the pinning issues that exist and the incentive compatibility considerations that come with it. On top of that, transaction chains themselves are hard to reason about in the context of coming up with optimal transaction selection for a miner and preventing mempool DoS in various ways (these are also topics I have substantial experience working on for this project). In thinking about all this, one conclusion I’ve reached is that Bitcoin’s transaction relay protocol and user behavior would likely have been far better from the start if the expectation was that the network wouldn’t generally relay transactions with unconfirmed parents – a position that I think is easy to justify if you look at the various anti-DoS rules we’ve put in place over the last 10 years which have generally served to limit the transactions which get relayed on the network, in comparison to what early versions of the software supported.\r\n\r\nNone of this discussion is relevant to full-rbf.\r\n \r\n> From a blank slate/initial policy of never allowing transactions with unconfirmed parents, relaxing that policy in specific situations to support narrow use cases which can be easily reasoned about would have been much better than the free-for-all we have now (where arbitrary transaction chains topologies are permitted, with the only limits being on certain kinds of package size and count).\r\n\r\n...and again, none of this is relevant to full-rbf. Indeed, talking about all this as \"rules\" gives the misleading impression that there are hard and fast rules that govern transaction acceptance. Exactly what got us into trouble with zeroconf in the first place!\r\n\r\n> In such a world, there would be a meaningful difference between transactions that can be replaced via feerate considerations, and transactions that the sender does not intend to replace. In the latter case, CPFP is a far more reasonable strategy than in the former, because the recipient who chains a transaction has greater reason to believe that they are doing something helpful rather than harmful by creating the chained transaction which feebumps the parent (and not just pinning the transaction and irritating the sender, or creating a transaction that will disappear when the parent is replaced and need to be reissued, or creating a DoS vector for the network by relaying something that will need to be evicted later – which is the central issue that creates the pinning consideration in the first place).\r\n> \r\n> Now I get that we aren’t starting from a blank slate; I wanted to take everyone through that thought experiment to try to understand that non-replacement is not intrinsically evil. Note that the CPFP use case I describe is completely benign, provided that the wallet engaging in it can reasonably handle the (likely rare, but certainly possible) situations where the first transaction doesn’t confirm for some reason (eg by being able to reissue a payment if needed).\r\n\r\nDiscussions about how edge cases of RBF and CPFP policy are not relevant to full-rbf. Except in the obvious way that full-rbf in the future could simplify some of these interactions by removing a category from the mempool: non-replaceable transactions. \r\n\r\nAs we've repeatedly discussed, over literally years, non-replaceable transactions certainly can't be relied on as such in normal wallets, so evil or not, they are not a feature that we have any reason to support.\r\n\r\n> Maybe you think improved CPFP policy is not compelling; that is fine and we can debate and perhaps disagree. Or, perhaps the CPFP signal can still be in place on a network where the non-replacement is not enforced; that is hard for me to say without a lot more thought.\r\n> \r\n> If you think about the policy regimes we have now or are currently discussing: (1) we have a way to opt-out of RBF (but still have lots of child transactions), (2) we have a way to opt-in to RBF (and still have lots of child transactions), and after the v3 proposal is deployed we will also have (3) a way to be able to opt-in to RBF and have just 1 child transaction (which itself will be limited). In some ways option (2) is the least well-designed option, in that the transaction graph complexities interact with the replacement rules in ways that result in outcomes that are both suboptimal for wallets and also sometimes incentive incompatible for miners, and it would make more sense to have option (2) restrict the child transaction graph further than it does today (but perhaps not so limited as option (3) will be, which is really tailored to a single use-case). If that were a road we go down, then that would make (1) a more compelling option to have available as a policy on the network to facilitate use cases that involve lots of child transactions, and if we eliminate (1) now I fear that any attempt to bring it back in the future will fail due to concerns about zeroconf merchants – something outside our control as protocol developers.\r\n\r\n...and in all this proposed complexity, it's clear that eliminating the category of non-replaceable transactions would simplify things.\r\n\r\n> And as I said on the mailing list, I also fear that eliminating (1) for the reasons given could also apply to eliminating (3) in the future. If you look at the reasons you gave above for not having (1) as a policy, I think at least two of them easily apply to the v3 transaction proposal – the consequences of users making mistakes and inadvertently using version 3 transactions when they intended to chain multiple children, and the privacy implications of another distinguished transaction type. Now I think we have good answers to those objections – namely that no one should be using v3 transactions unless they mean to – but if your arguments are found to be compelling in this case, I fear that the v3 policy design may be subverted in the future and the efforts we’re putting in now are a waste of time.\r\n\r\nLet's look at a counter-argument: why are we proposing to *remove* an option to experiment with full-rbf policy, at the same time that we're also trying to design another possibly-incentive-incompatible transaction policy, v3?\r\n\r\nWhy wouldn't we try to get some data on what incentives actually look like when experimenting with policy is easier? Why are we trying to artificially restrict that process of experimentation?\r\n\r\n> Perhaps it would be helpful to reviewers for me to explain what I think some of the best reasons to oppose this PR would be, in the interests of advancing the debate:\r\n> \r\n>     1. Complexity. If it’s more complex for our mempool policy code to support both rbf and non-rbf transactions, then that might be a good reason to merge the two into one regime (this could be either due to code complexity or logical complexity of the policies interact).\r\n\r\nIt's clear that full-rbf can make the mempool simpler in the future. One policy vs two.\r\n\r\n>     2. If you believe that this PR will be seen as a misguided endorsement of zeroconf then you might find that to be a compelling reason to reject this, even if you understood what I’m trying to actually get at here with my arguments about relay design philosophy.  Even though endorsing zeroconf is not my intention, I guess this is probably an issue that would need to be addressed, given the apparent lack of understanding here already and the lengthy explanations I have had to write up!\r\n\r\nYour arguments around relay design policy aren't relevant: yes, getting incentives right can be tricky. But full-rbf is a very clear case of incentives. And again, why are we diminishing our chances of getting data around incentives by trying to artificially prevent people from experimenting with them?\r\n\r\nRemember that we can't do that experimentation on testnet: testnet is worthless. The only place for experimentation with incentives is on mainnet, because incentives have to actually matter to be meaningful.\r\n\r\n>     3. The level of user/miner interest in having a knob to enable fullrbf may be so high that it’s absurd we don’t make the simple option available given what a simple code change it is to support, and the non-consensus nature of the option. (I think knobs should have intended use cases, so while I’m sympathetic to the principle here, I think weighing this comes down to deciding how important the fullrbf use case is compared to the alternative.)\r\n\r\nWe've got multiple wallet authors who have posted above saying they intend to make use of full-rbf. And there are extremely clear use-cases with recovering from stuck transactions. Which wallet authors have mentioned.\r\n \r\n>     4. The relative weighting of the other use cases that have been given for fullrbf, compared with my argument for the CPFP use case being strongest with non-replacement – reviewers can decide for themselves which use cases seem more compelling.\r\n\r\nWith the one exception of attempting to categorically prevent a transaction from being mined - the zeroconf \"use-case\" - having both CPFP and full-RBF simply means there is more than one way to get a transaction mined.\r\n\r\nAll pinning is about preventing transactions from getting mined at all. Full-RBF clearly can't make that problem worse. And it's clear that while it doesn't entirely prevent it in the multi-party scenario, it gets us closer to a solution.",

      "body": "@greenaddress \r\n\r\n> > For what purpose?\r\n> \r\n> Multiple purposes I would say. As a wallet sender I want to be able to replace a transaction made in error as well as bump the fee in a congested situation\r\n\r\nThose things are much more reliable if you set the rbf flag.\r\n\r\n> regardless of if the user had the hindsight to set the rbf flag (especially since nodes and miners can ignore said flag, pretty useless)\r\n\r\nAnd that is not reliable unless many nodes and miners support fullrbf, which is not something that a default false option achieves. It's also not relevant currently, as the mempool clears regularly.\r\n\r\nThis goal can also alternatively be achieved by lowering the mempool expiry time: just as a connected subgraph of fullrbf peers would allow you to broadcast a replacement tx; a connected subgraph of peers with a low expiry time, would also allow you to broadcast a replacement, and would allow you to do so without the other BIP 125 restrictions, such as having to increase the absolute fee, or not being able to conflict more than 100 descendants or not being able to introduce new unconfirmed parents.\r\n\r\n> As a receiver in a wallet I don't want the false sense of security, unconfirmed transactions can't be relied upon until they have a number of confirmations\r\n\r\nIt's always been your choice whether you give yourself a false sense of security in that case.\r\n\r\n> and if there is a transaction replacement with more incentives for miners to mine I want to be able to see it.\r\n\r\nAnd without or without full rbf it's quite easy to provide different nodes with different views of the mempool: simply announce conflicting txs at the same fee rate to different peers. That can be done in advance and used as an input to a transaction that you want to have finer propagation control over. It's also something that appears to be routinely occurring on the network currently.",

As a wallet sender I want to be able to replace a transaction made in error as well as bump the fee in a congested situation\n>\n>Those things are much more reliable if you set the rbf flag.\n\nSince services like Bitrerill treat opt-in-rbf transactions differently, wallets like Green and Electrum have reasons to send transactions without the flag.\n\nThose transactions can still however become stuck. And in that circumstance full-rbf is essential to get them unstuck. @SomberNight already explained this use-case above in detail and they personally would use a mempoolfullrbf flag for it.\n\n>> regardless of if the user had the hindsight to set the rbf flag (especially since nodes and miners can ignore said flag, pretty useless)\n>\n>And that is not reliable unless many nodes and miners support full-rbf, which is not something that a default false option achieves. It's also not relevant currently, as the mempool clears regularly.\n\nThe mempool is not guaranteed to clear regularly. Mempool pressure can, and does, change all the time. It's quite common for minimum fee OpenTimestamps transactions to take dozens of blocks to get mined due to mempool usage spikes. It is completely reasonable to want this feature for the times when pressure is high.\n\nNode support is not relevant to Green, as they can easily run their own. And of course, with the mempoolfullrbf option we can expect a lot more people to run full-rbf nodes. In testing I've found that there are enough of them out there now that a node with the usual 125 connections has a decent chance of having a full-rbf peer.\n\n>This goal can also alternatively be achieved by lowering the mempool expiry time: just as a connected subgraph of fullrbf peers would allow you to broadcast a replacement tx; a connected subgraph of peers with a low expiry time, would also allow you to broadcast a replacement, and would allow you to do so without the other BIP 125 restrictions, such as having to increase thec absolute fee, or not being able to conflict more than 100 descendants or not being able to introduce new unconfirmed parents.\n\nWhy are we discussing a convoluted alternative with clearly worse outcomes than just running full-rbf? That's not a like-for-like alternative to what these users want to do.\n\nIs it because you are concerned that providing the option at all would harm zeroconf? Let's be clear here.\n\n>> and if there is a transaction replacement with more incentives for miners to mine I want to be able to see it.\n>\n>And without or without full rbf it's quite easy to provide different nodes with different views of the mempool: simply announce conflicting txs at the same fee rate to different peers. That can be done in advance and used as an input to a transaction that you want to have finer propagation control over. It's also something that appears to be routinely occurring on the network currently.\n\nYour point? Why should the existence of another mechanism of double spending discourage the running of full-rbf nodes? Green (and others) have perfectly valid reasons to run them.\n\nIs it because you're trying to protect zeroconf by taking away an option?\n",

      "body": "> Reading the reasoning on the mailing post, I think there are more long-term implications in the suggestion of adopting the transaction-relay policy of non-interfering use cases to what the network supposes. Especially the concern we might create mining income asymmetries due to unequal access to transactions flows bypassing policies, in a future where fees should substantially contribute to block reward. \r\n\r\n@ariard I don't understand what you mean here.  The philosophy I'm articulating is one where, at least in this software project, we try to keep policy rules in sync with one another, generally only deviating in situations where node resources become an issue (so keeping flags for minimum relay fee, maximum mempool size, and perhaps transaction chain limits are probably fine -- as those only serve to interfere with relay for transactions that would have poor relay propagation properties anyway).\r\n\r\nIf the policy rules are largely in sync, and the policies are designed to accommodate all the use cases we can come up with, then no one has a strong incentive to relay transactions privately to miners.  I think this is the best outcome. \r\n\r\n> Answering on the direct questions, as argued multiple times, full-rbf removes one DoS concern for multi-party transactions flows. The solution is satisfying in the sense, if full-rbf is deployed on the majority of the network, a participant to a coinjoin transaction can expect the target transaction, if it offers a better fee in the definition of BIP125 to propagate to the miners. The coinjoin protocol execution doesn't have to halt, and it can keep progressing forward as long as you have fee-bumping reserves available to compete with blockspace demand >\r\n\r\nThanks for responding to this point, because I didn't expect after the recent discussion on ways to pin a coinjoin transaction that you would still think fullrbf is a solution.  (Furthermore, if we adopted a relay policy like I proposed in #26451, I think the pinning problem would get much, much worse, which further emphasizes the issue that pinning problems are hard to solve.)\r\n\r\nFor clarity to everyone else, I think it's helpful if we can establish what the coinjoin/multiparty funding transaction model is that you're working with, because it took me a few iterations of offline discussion with @instagibbs to understand the issue.  (Also, if my understanding is different than what you're thinking about, this would be a good time to get on the same page.)\r\n\r\nI believe the example of the coinjoin protocol you're thinking about is one where anonymous users express interest in a coinjoin, and start with some sort of signing round where they coordinate a transaction with inputs and outputs they each provide.  (I'm guessing there are various timeouts and such so that if one party stalls, they get dropped from the transaction, and the rest of the group continues.)\r\n\r\nOnce the inputs and signatures have been verified to look good to everyone -- perhaps there's a requirement that all the inputs are confirmed, and that all the inputs pass the standardness rules of Bitcoin Core -- then a coordinator will broadcast the transaction on the network.  The coordinator wants to be able to do this, and have it succeed, without having to inspect its own mempool, and without connecting to other nodes to see what is in their mempools.  As time passes, the coordinator may rbf this transaction to try to increase the likelihood that it confirms (it's not clear to me how this happens, do the other participants pre-sign feebumped versions initially?).\r\n\r\nIf the transaction becomes conflicted with what is in the chain, then the coordinator's wallet can detect this, determine which party's input was double-spent, and remove that party from the protocol and restart with the remaining users.  Eventually, the protocol will terminate when an honest subset of users are able to complete their coinjoin.\r\n\r\nThe problem arises when a user or group of users (or a user pretending to be a group of users, and able to take multiple inputs of the transaction) can indefinitely stall the protocol, by relaying a low feerate transaction that cannot be feebumped away, and which doesn't confirm on its own for a long time.  The question is, how might an adversary achieve this (and at what cost), and what tools are available to protocol designers to prevent it?  \r\n\r\nThe limitation of not inspecting your own or any other node's mempool to see what transactions are relayed on the public network is a significant limitation, and while I can understand why it would be very useful if we could design a protocol in this way, I'm not sure that limitation is one that the network should accept as a reason to enforce a policy on everyone.  But putting that aside, the pinning issues that exist even in a fullrbf world would make this protocol vulnerable to stalling all the same, albeit at greater cost than in a non-fullrbf world.  The example I gave on the mailing list was that an adversary could pin the coinjoin transaction by relaying a double-spend that was large and had low feerate.  If we adopted something like #26451, then this pin would be extremely effective if the adversary chained a single low fee, but high feerate transaction to their double-spend (under the rules I proposed in #26451, the replacement transaction would both need to be high fee to pay for all the fees being removed from the mempool, and high feerate to satisfy the incentive compatibility heuristic - even though the transactions generated by the adversary might not be mined for a long time, because the ancestor feerate of the child might be very low).\r\n\r\nI also mentioned on the mailing list that an adversary with multiple inputs into the coinjoin could use the 100 transaction limit to prevent any rbf from occurring at all.  The cost of this might not be very high, because the 100 transactions used can all be small.\r\n\r\nAnd finally just recently I thought of a new DoS attack that you could run into, which is that an adversary can use RBF to keep your coinjoin transaction out of the network's mempools, without ever actually having their coinjoin input double-spent in a mined block.  Imagine the coinjoin transaction is relayed on the network and in everyone's mempool.  The adversary can double-spend their input in a higher fee/higher feerate transaction that includes multiple inputs.  Then they double-spend that transaction by conflicting with one of the other inputs that were spending, resulting in a situation where the coinjoin transaction would be eligible for inclusion in node mempools (because there are no longer any conflicting spends of its inputs), but due to relay optimizations no node would reannounce or relay the transaction for a while, at least until the next block is mined.  For an adversary that is willing to issue one transaction at the prevailing block fees each block, the coinjoin could be stalled indefinitely with no ability to detect which user is causing the problem, assuming your model is that you don't inspect the mempool.\r\n\r\nI don't know if you think that all these attacks are too costly for anyone to bother with, but it seems to me that it would make more sense to iron out the deficiencies in our RBF policies and try to improve them first and decide what level of attacker costs you're concerned with, before asking the network to try to address this use case, since it seems like fullrbf is not going to be enough.  Moreover, based on recent mailing list discussion, it seems like the existing coinjoin implementations out there don't even signal for RBF on their transactions and aren't worried about these kinds of DoS vectors at the moment [[1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021082.html)] [[2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021152.html)].\r\n\r\nOne concrete problem with deploying fullrbf before these problems are worked out is that I would expect it to be even harder to change the replacement rules we have when more users' transactions would be affected.\r\n\r\n> Another more distant concern (yet to be backed up by more research), full-rbf removes a mass mempool-partitioning vector, where an attacker could partition all the network mempools states and from then alter fee-estimation or leverage this as a building block for advanced pinning (cf. the last attack scenario [0]). Of course, partitioning mempools states due to policy difference is always a potential outcome (e.g Taproot transactions between upgraded and non-upgrade nodes), however I wonder what level of difficulty and cost we should burden on an attacker, or consider this as inevitable.\r\n\r\nI think this is already possible in a fullrbf world, due to the ease with which someone can construct two transactions that are mutually non-replaceable under our current rules (if transaction A has higher feerate than B, but B has greater fees than A, then neither one will displace the other.). Perhaps I don't follow what your security model is for this concern?\r\n\r\n> On the second question, if we had a stronger model of what we mean by incentive-compatible, rather to evaluate any rule on a binary approach (i.e either compatible or not), we could adopt a quantitative approach. \r\n\r\nI completely agree that a problem we are running into is that the notion of what \"incentive compatible\" means is not well-defined.  I have attempted to articulate a philosophy of how I think we can work to meet different use cases that may not be incentive compatible if they were the only deployed policy on the network, but that I think are incentive compatible in the sense that users should have no need to subvert their flaws in the presence of policy options that meet their use case.  If people don't think my philosophy works, I'd be interested to hear of other philosophies that are workable to meet use cases on the network.  Thus far I'm not aware of any single set of policy rules that we could apply to all transactions that would satisfy the current use cases on the network (and please note that I'm ignoring the idea of \"zeroconf\" as a use case, which I think is a business practice that is not directly tied to any particular set of relay policies -- I'm thinking instead of CPFP, coinjoins, lightning, fee bumping, etc).\r\n\r\n> On the last question, if someone proposes a command line option that breaks v3 transaction relay in the future, I think I would be in favor of such change. I could understand a full-node operator which is not partaking in Lightning neither interested to have compelling fee-estimation, and willing to reduce the CPU DoS surface of a low-performance node. Any transaction-relay rules or mempool acceptance rules, even wisely designed and reviewed, increases the bug surface of a full-node, a risk a node operator could choose to not burden with.\r\n\r\nI completely disagree with this!  If you want to limit CPU DoS surface, don't relay transactions. It would be absurd to me that censoring a *type* of transaction would be a culture we'd want to promote in our project, for such a flimsy reason.\r\n",

      "body": "@sdaftuar \r\n\r\n> If the policy rules are largely in sync, and the policies are designed to accommodate all the use cases we can come up with, then no one has a strong incentive to relay transactions privately to miners. I think this is the best outcome.\r\n\r\nAs made clear by multiple wallet authors (Green, Electrum, and [Trezor](https://twitter.com/slush/status/1588832641796943874)) and others, bumping fees and canceling non-opt-in-rbf transactions is an important usecase. All three of those wallets went to the trouble of NACKing this pull-req. This use-case is so important that one person who spoke up above has even been running a full-rbf patch for years to help users get their transactions unstuck in times of congestion.\r\n\r\nThat's a very strong incentive to relay transactions privately, and yet your pull-req here aims to put up road-blocks to that use-case.\r\n\r\n> The problem arises when a user or group of users (or a user pretending to be a group of users, and able to take multiple inputs of the transaction) can indefinitely stall the protocol, by relaying a low feerate transaction that cannot be feebumped away, and which doesn't confirm on its own for a long time. The question is, how might an adversary achieve this (and at what cost), and what tools are available to protocol designers to prevent it?\r\n\r\n(snip irrelevant coinjoin discussion)\r\n\r\n> I don't know if you think that all these attacks are too costly for anyone to bother with, but it seems to me that it would make more sense to iron out the deficiencies in our RBF policies and try to improve them first and decide what level of attacker costs you're concerned with, before asking the network to try to address this use case, since it seems like fullrbf is not going to be enough. Moreover, based on recent mailing list discussion, it seems like the existing coinjoin implementations out there don't even signal for RBF on their transactions and aren't worried about these kinds of DoS vectors at the moment [[1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021082.html)] [[2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021152.html)].\r\n\r\nAs per the mailing list discussion, both Wasabi wallet and Joinmarket are well aware of full-rbf. In both cases RBF transactions and pinning are just another kind of DoS attack that they have to deal with - a much more common type of DoS attack is to simply fail to complete the signing round. Both wallets have mechanisms to assign blame, and they expect to have to improve those mechanisms over time for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nBringing up Coinjoin in this discussion is irrelevant: full-rbf certainly does not make the problem any worse, as it simply provides one more way that inputs can get mined. Bringing this up as a *blocker* to merging a default-off full-rbf patch is disingenuous.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat that: full-rbf fundamentally can't make pinning worse. Pinning attacks attempt to *prevent* a transaction from being mined. Full-RBF provides an *additional* way that a transaction can be mined.\r\n\r\n> One concrete problem with deploying fullrbf before these problems are worked out is that I would expect it to be even harder to change the replacement rules we have when more users' transactions would be affected.\r\n\r\nFull-RBF is identical to our current replacement rules, with the one difference that it applies to more transactions. That's it. There is no way some users/miners choosing to run it will make the pinning problem even worse.\r\n\r\n> I think this is already possible in a fullrbf world, due to the ease with which someone can construct two transactions that are mutually non-replaceable under our current rules (if transaction A has higher feerate than B, but B has greater fees than A, then neither one will displace the other.). Perhaps I don't follow what your security model is for this concern?\r\n\r\n...and again, bringing up this issue is an irrelevant distraction, as full-rbf clearly can't make the situation worse.\r\n\r\n> I completely agree that a problem we are running into is that the notion of what \"incentive compatible\" means is not well-defined. I have attempted to articulate a philosophy of how I think we can work to meet different use cases that may not be incentive compatible if they were the only deployed policy on the network, but that I think are incentive compatible in the sense that users should have no need to subvert their flaws in the presence of policy options that meet their use case. If people don't think my philosophy works, I'd be interested to hear of other philosophies that are workable to meet use cases on the network. Thus far I'm not aware of any single set of policy rules that we could apply to all transactions that would satisfy the current use cases on the network (and please note that I'm ignoring the idea of \"zeroconf\" as a use case, which I think is a business practice that is not directly tied to any particular set of relay policies -- I'm thinking instead of CPFP, coinjoins, lightning, fee bumping, etc).\r\n\r\nTalking about perfect notions of incentive compatibility is irrelevant to the discussion at hand. There are always going to be different notions of incentives and different mempool implementations. That's ok. The only users who can't accept diversity in mempool policy are those trying to make zeroconf work.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, by taking away an option, you are restricting the ability of users and miners to experiment and learn about incentive compatible policies in favor of a top-down design approach. Why are you trying to restrict this experimentation?\r\n\r\n> I completely disagree with this! If you want to limit CPU DoS surface, don't relay transactions. It would be absurd to me that censoring a _type_ of transaction would be a culture we'd want to promote in our project, for such a flimsy reason.\r\n\r\nYou are trying to censor a type of transaction right now: full-rbf replacements. The status quo for v24.0 would be to provide an option for users and minors to relay/mine those transactions, and you are trying to take that option away.",

Giving full nodes an option to change it (when some users are already doing this) without changing the default is not imposing anything.

I think you make a great argument about why it helps but doesn't stop it. Are you proposing that we delay until we fix those problems, which you later make the argument that we'll never really fix because user policies can always disable things like transaction v3? It gets to the point where you're arguing that policies don't really matter in the end and that any effort toward progress is pointless. To be fair, I don't know if transaction v3 is good enough to solve our problems or not and I think your thought experiments around -disable_v3_transaction_enforcement is interesting and should be a consideration as devs make progress towards it but I feel like it's a different issue that full RBF shouldn't be pinned to as a reason for not going forward with it.\r\n\r\n    Does fullrbf offer any benefits other than breaking zeroconf business\r\n    practices?  If so, what are they?\r\n\r\nYou can't break what is already broken. These were terrible assumptions to begin with. If you want instant transactions with delayed settlement, there's a thing called Lightning.\r\n\r\nTo start with, let's chat about why this doesn't change anything for them. If their arguments for why it's necessary revolve around the fact that they can do proper risk assessment and manage it appropriately, that doesn't change. Let them continue to do their risk assessment. There's still going to be a % of users that may decide to double spend given X amount of sats.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I find the original motivation for this change coming from Muun to be overstated and a use case that should not be advocated for. There's a difference between a merchant delivering a product on 0 conf and Muun providing 0 conf submarine swaps with the illusion that they are atomic. They are not and they are lying to their users, there's nothing atomic about them when it's 0 conf. Furthermore, there are many ways that their model is both unsustainable and insecure. There are plenty of ways to steal money from them regardless of 0 conf. I bring it up as an example of why users and use cases may be wrong in general, so why not rip the bandaid off now? You agree it should happen eventually, why not happen when it's at the top of everyone's minds and also to prevent other businesses in the future from falling trap to the illusions given by non-RBF and non-RBF companies?\"\r\n\r\nhttps://stacker.news/items/89456",

      "body": "Concept NACK.\r\n\r\nYour reasoning assumes mempool policy is a global decision made by the Bitcoin Core developers. This premise is incorrect. It is a per-node decision, subject to the whims of the owner of the individual node. While we don't have to actively support all options, there is no justification for denying users the right to use a policy when the development team is willing to maintain that support.\r\n\r\nAll arguments against full RBF are worth consideration only by those end users and when developers decide if we want to spend time maintaining/supporting the policy. To an extent, it may make sense to influence the default policy setting as well. But it is not an excuse to obstruct wilful developers from providing wilful users with a policy they wish to use.\r\n\r\n> Does fullrbf offer any benefits other than breaking zeroconf business practices? If so, what are they?\r\n\r\nExposing reality for what it is, at least. Unconfirmed transactions are no safer than RBF-enabled transactions, and the false idea that they are is apparently leading to businesses to harm not only themselves, but also users. For example, it was related to me that users paying for a product with a RBF-signalling transaction, are defrauded of their product, and have to jump through hoops to even get their bitcoins returned to them.\r\n\r\n(I'm assuming others have already offered more obvious use cases)\r\n\r\n>Is it reasonable to enforce BIP 125's rbf rules on all transactions, if those rules themselves are not always incentive compatible?\r\n\r\nTo begin with, \"incentive compatible\" is just one ideology/policy, not the only one. Most nodes gain nothing from fees, so have no direct incentive to favour higher fees in the first place. Some developers attempting to force only a limited ideology on Bitcoin Core is part of the project's problems, and not a valid justification.\r\n\r\n>If someone were to propose a command line option that breaks v3 transaction relay in the future, is there a logical basis for opposing that which is consistent with moving towards fullrbf now?\r\n\r\nNot comparable at all.",

I think your reasoning @sdaftuar provided in bitcoin-dev misses the crux of this issue - mempool policy is up to each individual full node. I am very inline w/ @luke-jr's comment above.\r\n\r\nAs a general principle I am very in favor of Linux/Torvalds \"WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE\" golden rule. And I would hate to see anything that breaks zerconf **as long as it is being used** (regardless of how I or anyone else feels about it). So if that's how you feel it is your responsibility to campaign with full node operators to not take the time/effort to exercise this option (which is already their right, with or without this option being formalized).",

This would change years of Bitcoin standard behavior and impose qualities on people that did not know or choose to opt in to those qualities. It is not Core's place to decide such a change for users. \n\nCore is not deciding such a change for users. Core is allowing users to choose such a change.\n\n>This will just force us to have to create a RFS respect-first-seen flag, and go in circles. What does Core do when RFS people come in droves to comment on the issue of changing mempool policy to RFS by default? The whole thing is silly, no?\n\nWe ignore them, because what they're asking for would be foolish.\n\n...and with a RFS flag, some merchants would demand it be set, those transactions would get stuck on occasion, and there would be reasons to override the flag.\n\nThe fact is in a decentralized system like Bitcoin, unconfirmed transactions are second class citizens and no amount of hope can change that.\n\nWhat's silly is trying to force the issue. Doubly silly when we're trying to force it by removing options!\n\n>Right now, people that want to RBF already can, and any wallet that wants to offer RBF-by-default as a differentiating service can (and some do). Meanwhile, merchants can accept and limit their risk and provide 0conf acceptance as a service to Bitcoiners that meet next-block-likely-inclusion fee requirements. We have a nice incentive-compatible stasis with maximum utility already. Do not break this.\n\nMultiple wallet authors have spoken up on this topic. The fact is for good user experience, the ability to double spend unconfirmed transactions of all types is important.\n\nMeanwhile, in the real world, the vast majority of Bitcoin users don't even try to rely on zeroconf because attempting to do so results in getting defrauded.\n\nIf by some dark magic zeroconf somehow worked reliably, merchants certainly would accept it widely. They don't, because decentralized wallets certainly can't safely rely on zeroconf.\n",

What is relevant is the effect of this proposed pull-req. This PR is a step towards keeping zeroconf going. As is the v24.0-only alternative: #26456\r\n\r\n@petertodd Please -- if you read the quoted text, I am responding to a claim that *you* made about my intent.  If my intent doesn't matter, then don't assign intent to me, especially if it's wrong.  If my response to your comment is irrelevant, then perhaps you should rethink what you post in this forum, because you're wasting our time.  (Perhaps you could go further and \r\napologize for bringing my intent into this, when as you say, it doesn't seem to matter?)\r\n \r\n> None of this discussion is relevant to full-rbf.\r\n\r\nIt absolutely is relevant to consider the ways in which \"fullrbf\" is incentive *incompatible*.  Can anyone commenting on this PR even describe a set of policy rules that would implement fullrbf which are always incentive compatible?  (If so, someone should open a PR -- I attempted to yesterday and then discovered a mistake; these things are hard.) If you're going to suggest that we apply rules to all transactions that we didn't previously apply for the sake of incentive compatibility, it's worth understanding what that really means.\r\n\r\n(Maybe that is not precisely your argument, but I think that idea captures the vast majority of how people reading this thread think about \"fullrbf\" in the abstract, and things are far more subtle than that.)\r\n \r\n> Let's look at a counter-argument: why are we proposing to _remove_ an option to experiment with full-rbf policy, at the same time that we're also trying to design another possibly-incentive-incompatible transaction policy, v3?\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of options going on here that are counter to each other. I am arguing for giving Bitcoin users more options, by trying to establish that neutral policies that give them more choices for how their transactions are handled should not be subverted in our software.  You are trying to give node operators more choices that could lead to subverting those policies, removing use cases from our software for users.\r\n\r\nI think my view of the world is more consistent with making the Bitcoin network work well, not just in this case but for future policy work (such as v3 transactions).\r\n \r\n> Why wouldn't we try to get some data on what incentives actually look like when experimenting with policy is easier? Why are we trying to artificially restrict that process of experimentation?\r\n\r\nWe could also give everyone a knob to control every policy rule we have, and I think that is foolish.  A principle that I have heard articulated by others that I agree with is that we should only offer a knob/command line option if we can also advise users when they might want to use it.  Which is why I have been consistently asking for the use case of fullrbf, given that we already have opt-in rbf.  It seems that the main use case for fullrbf that you and I both agree on is users making mistakes, perhaps from using wallet software that doesn't opt-in, and then regretting it later when they can't feebump/replace their transaction. (There is also the privacy angle that you mentioned, but I think that argument is weak, as wallets have a coordination problem for how they set these fields in a transaction regardless of whether opt-in is a policy or not, and I don't think the opt-in flag meaningfully changes that.)\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that such mistakes are bad, they seem avoidable and I think it's a weak rationale; the whole point of opt-in RBF is to give users a way to avoid the situation. \r\n\r\nYour repeated comments about the irrelevancy of what I'm saying makes me think you're not really interested in engaging with my thinking.  If you disagree with that assessment and are willing to spend the time, I'd ask you to try to steelman the argument you think I'm making and summarize it here, so that I can assess whether we're getting anywhere or, indeed, this is a waste of time for both of us to continue discussing.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I'm open to being wrong about this -- I'm specifically looking for a development philosophy that is consistent with both moving towards fullrbf that is consistent with where I see future policy development going, such as for the v3 case that I've brought up several times.  I've yet to see such a philosophy articulated in a way that I can understand, and almost every commenter has ignored this line of thinking, which all makes me believe that no one thus far is thinking about this adequately.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you have a philosophy that would suggest that all the work we're doing on package rbf/package relay/v3 transactions is a big waste of time, then that would be helpful to hear as well, because maybe all that work is misguided and we should give up coordinating policy on a decentralized network.  (It would be good think about the implications of this for layer 2 projects like lightning.) If you predict, for instance, that user mistakes and privacy concerns in the future will mean that people will work to subvert alternate policies like v3 once they're deployed, it'd be better to establish that now and save a lot of dev work.\r\n\r\n> All pinning is about preventing transactions from getting mined at all. Full-RBF clearly can't make that problem worse. And it's clear that while it doesn't entirely prevent it in the multi-party scenario, it gets us closer to a solution.\r\n\r\nPinning arises in two ways: an adversary trying to abuse our rules, or a coordination problem between sender and recipient. I believe the latter is far more common than the former, as people have been complaining about pinning since we deployed opt-in RBF.  Offering tools to help prevent pinning with better coordination seems obviously useful.",

      "body": "@sdaftuar\r\n> Same question for you, I'm not familiar with what wallets the users you're referring to might be using; is there an issue with having opt-in be the default for these wallets?\r\n\r\nWell, ideally all wallets should be defaulting to RBF having opted in, sure, but they don't. I expect there would always be wallets that not only not default to RBF but don't even expose an option to set it.\r\n\r\nI don't know what weird wallets people are using these days, but I distinctly remember e.g. users of the blockchain.info webwallet complaining about not signalling (and then finding Electrum, restoring from seed and trying to RBF) - but I don't even know if blockchain.info still has a wallet these days. The Electrum wallet has defaulted to creating RBF transactions for many years, and had options to replace txs for even longer, so there are lots of guides that come up in search engines that people find in times of mempool congestion.\r\n\r\nAlso, BitPay in particular, but IIRC maybe other merchants too, have been actively telling users to disable RBF in their wallets (to facilitate zeroconf). Just now I've tried donating to a service that uses BitPay using Electrum and got the following \"warning\" on the website:\r\n![bitpay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29142493/200149363-8e45aad0-f210-4788-be11-d020c4e65193.PNG)\r\n(\"Show me how\" [links to this](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032796211))\r\nIf a user disables RBF, then it stays disabled, unless they remember to re-enable it after -- although I guess Electrum could be more aggressive and make the setting per-transaction. I guess same might apply to other wallets (?).\r\n\r\n> is there a reason that transactions your software generates (or that you generate as a user) don't always opt-in to RBF? If there's an issue with why that can't be a default to avoid these kinds of problems, I'd be interested to hear it.\r\n\r\nI guess only somewhat related but still might be interesting to some: Electrum never opts-in to RBF for lightning funding txs (see https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/7072). This is specifically to make it very difficult for users to destructively RBF the funding tx. Double-spend-to-self would be fine but \"increase fee\" would burn the coins: the 2of2 multisig output would stay but the txid would change, so the funding outpoint (so the channel id) would change, leaving the other node not finding the channel and deleting it. The wallet opening the channel ofc knows it is a funding tx and use that knowledge, but if a user restored from seed and bumped the fee on a different wallet, well that would be problematic (note that channel v2 has the same issue). So we don't opt-in to RBF for funding txs, and the GUI only offers bumping the fee if RBF is signalled.\r\n(and as I explained in my previous comment, I personally was sort of burned by this once, when I was trying to RBF-cancel a funding tx)\r\n\r\n",

All for a flag that is a gimmick that can be bypassed at will.\r\n\r\nWe experimented with a few options and generally users are confused with replaceability and it makes no sense to confuse or complicate users life. At the moment it is always on but we were recently planning to bring back the option in advanced settings. Still not very useful for your average users.\r\n\r\nUltimately with or without the flag transactions can be replaced. The only difference with this PR being merged or not is users being forced to use knots or a release candidate (possibly with bugs) or self compile.\r\n\r\nEither way, all our green and electrum/esplora/blocksyream.info servers were planned to run with the flag on as of release. Luckily we already self compile so it's only limited extra effort and extra delay on our side for each release but that is not true of all users. And even for us the extra pain and delay in adopting releases is not ideal.\r\n\r\nIt seems a few electrum servers are already using this policy and we are likely to attempt direct peering.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I tend to agree with @petertodd explaining above\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I think you make a great argument about why it helps but doesn't stop it. Are you proposing that we delay until we fix those problems, which you later make the argument that we'll never really fix because user policies can always disable things like transaction v3? It gets to the point where you're arguing that policies don't really matter in the end and that any effort toward progress is pointless. To be fair, I don't know if transaction v3 is good enough to solve our problems or not and I think your thought experiments around `-disable_v3_transaction_enforcement` is interesting and should be a consideration as devs make progress towards it but I feel like it's a different issue that full RBF shouldn't be pinned to as a reason for not going forward with it.\r\n\r\n> Does fullrbf offer any benefits other than breaking zeroconf business\r\npractices?  If so, what are they?\r\n\r\nYou can't break what is already broken. These were terrible assumptions to begin with. If you want instant transactions with delayed settlement, there's a thing called Lightning.\r\n\r\nTo start with, let's chat about why this *doesn't* change anything for them. If their arguments for why it's necessary revolve around the fact that they can do proper risk assessment and manage it appropriately, that doesn't change. Let them continue to do their risk assessment. There's still going to be a % of users that may decide to double spend given X amount of sats.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I find the original motivation for this change coming from Muun to be overstated and a use case that should not be advocated for. There's a difference between a merchant delivering a product on 0 conf and Muun providing 0 conf submarine swaps with the illusion that they are atomic. They are not and they are lying to their users, there's nothing atomic about them when it's 0 conf. Furthermore, there are many ways that their model is both unsustainable and insecure. There are plenty of ways to steal money from them regardless of 0 conf. I bring it up as an example of why users and use cases may be wrong in general, so why not rip the bandaid off now? You agree it should happen eventually, why not happen when it's at the top of everyone's minds and also to prevent other businesses in the future from falling trap to the illusions given by non-RBF and non-RBF companies?",

This would allow our app to turn off RBF only when merchants specify to... but none of this will work if mempools force optin rbf.\r\n\r\nThis really is something totally manageable at the app layer with a first-seen mempool policy! Bitcoin is just better and can do more if we leave the current mempool culture intact. If you want to join our effort to update BIP21, everyone is welcome.\r\n\r\nLightning also benefits from 0conf and first-seen as it allows wallets/LSPs to offer 0conf spending in new channels, and seamless UX once splicing is in place.\r\n\r\nWe should not promote features that impose new txn qualities onto users that did not opt in to those qualities. Some people here even admit wanting to kill first-seen because it makes people \"face reality\" and prevents them from accepting 0conf. Hurting a useful mutual use case is an insane goal.\r\n\r\nIf all txns were always easy to doublespend, and merchants are delusional, then RBF would not exist in the first place! \r\n\r\nMerchant adoption is an important part of Bitcoin economy and growth, removing 0conf viability incentivizes more forms of KYC and more reliance on payment processors, increasing costs, censorship, centralization, and reducing privacy. \r\n\r\nIf your rbf experience is not ideal, choose a better wallet, lobby your wallet to change, or improve your wallet UX like we do. Do not impose it on the whole network (as only ~15% of fullrbf pools would effect into 100% rbf behavior) by modifying Core tools.",

Do they just wait for it to confirm and then everything works, or does something more terrible happen?\r\n\r\nA couple things occur to me:\r\n- It's surprising to me that some lightning-enabled wallets have found a use for non-replacement (avoiding that footgun with LN funding transactions).\r\n- The \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" comment relating to opt-in RBF makes it seem like there is at least some demand for non-RBF transactions.  Otherwise there would be no problem with defaulting everyone in to RBF and not worry about exposing an option to disable it, right?  Is the only demand for non-RBF transactions coming from people who run into things like the bitpay notification and then try to disable it in their wallet, or do users have other reasons as well?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like there are two ways of looking at this: removing the ability to opt-out of RBF would be some simplification, because it would be a force towards eliminating a distinction that is confusing to users.  On the other hand, the existence of wallets that do not signal opt-in RBF in all situations implies some benefits to a multi-policy regime, particularly if we're seeing those behaviors in wallets that aren't just legacy software from pre-2016.\r\n\r\nAlso it's worth pointing out that it's not entirely clear the opt-in \"signal\" would go away if we get rid of non-replacement.  Signaling is just a convention, and imparting meaning to it even in the absence of a validation rule enforcing it is something that wallets will be free to do.  Given the history of BIP 125 signaling, and the current wallet software on the network, I'd think that it's entirely possible a new standard might emerge where wallets may still signal for non-replacement intent, particularly because older wallets presumably are coded up to not try to double-spend BIP 125 signaling transactions and it will require deploying a software change to enable such behavior.  This might have the benefit of continuing to provide footgun relief for the LN commitment transaction case, for instance (the signal becomes a signal that is internal to the wallet, maybe that is the best outcome?) -- but of course could also be used by the likes of bitpay.  Were this to happen, I think this type of outcome would come at the expense of becoming an even more confusing situation for users trying to understand the options and what they really mean.\r\n\r\nI don't know the best way to weigh these concerns.  My thought would have been that by now, modern wallets (certainly ones developed in the last few years, such as lightning wallets) would have just opted all transactions in to RBF to achieve largely the same effect as deploying fullrbf on the network for their own users.  If there are reasons for that to not happen -- seemingly because non-replaceability has some benefits -- I don't think we should ignore that.\r\n\r\nI also think the simplicity from having a single policy regime is a serious consideration and should not be dismissed. While I still tend to lean towards a multiple-policy approach, I can see how others (particularly those with user-facing applications) might disagree.\r\n\r\nAll in all, while I think there's merit to the argument in favor of a fullrbf deployment to simplify how users understand transaction types on the network, I think it still raises a few questions that we should try answer:\r\n- Are the RBF rules we have so complex that it will create even more questions for users?  (As one example, will intentional pinning become a use case for anyone?  That seems awful for the network, but I would imagine it could arise if there's a use case to prevent replacements, whether for UX reasons or economic incentive reasons or otherwise.)\r\n- Will modifying our RBF rules to try to be more incentive compatible for miners, eliminate DoS risks or pinning, etc be more difficult if all users' transactions are subject to those rules, and more software is dependent on the particular policy rules we currently have in place?  For instance, I've previously held off on advocating for changes like #26451 because I imagined they would be quite disruptive -- am I mistaken?  If it is disruptive, that might imply that future improvements should instead be made in an opt-in basis only, which would be contradictory to what we're doing now.\r\n- What implications does this line of reasoning (about simplicity of our ruleset) have on other work that is going on, such as package relay/package rbf/v3 transactions?",

If my intent doesn't matter, then don't assign intent to me, especially if it's wrong. If my response to your comment is irrelevant, then perhaps you should rethink what you post in this forum, because you're wasting our time. (Perhaps you could go further and apologize for bringing my intent into this, when as you say, it doesn't seem to matter?)\r\n\r\nSorry, I had misremembered who I had written that in response too. Anyway, my point is still correct: regardless of what your intent is, the impact is the same regardless of what you intend to do.\r\n\r\n> > None of this discussion is relevant to full-rbf.\r\n> \r\n> It absolutely is relevant to consider the ways in which \"fullrbf\" is incentive _incompatible_. Can anyone commenting on this PR even describe a set of policy rules that would implement fullrbf which are always incentive compatible? (If so, someone should open a PR -- I attempted to yesterday and then discovered a mistake; these things are hard.) If you're going to suggest that we apply rules to all transactions that we didn't previously apply for the sake of incentive compatibility, it's worth understanding what that really means.\r\n\r\nOpt-in-RBF was incentive compatible enough to merge into Bitcoin. It's exactly the same thing as Full-RBF, with one constraint added to it: opt-in. That constraint makes it *obviously* less incentive compatible for the obvious reason that sometimes high-fee-paying transactions exist that could be mined with full-rbf.\r\n\r\nWhether or not full-rbf is \"incentive incompatible\" in some hypothetical situations is _entirely irrelevant_ to this discussion! It's fine to bring this up when discussing how we're going to modify replace-by-fee behaviors in the future. But you bringing up here is just a distraction from the actual debate at hand.\r\n\r\n> (Maybe that is not precisely your argument, but I think that idea captures the vast majority of how people reading this thread think about \"fullrbf\" in the abstract, and things are far more subtle than that.)\r\n\r\nYou keep trying to argue that this is a subtle issue. It is not. The subtleties around replace-by-fee are irrelevant to the discussion about the opt-in flag.\r\n\r\n> There are two sets of options going on here that are counter to each other. **I am arguing for giving Bitcoin users more options**, by trying to establish that neutral policies that give them more choices for how their transactions are handled should not be subverted in our software. You are trying to give node operators more choices that could lead to subverting those policies, removing use cases from our software for users.\r\n\r\n(emphasis mine) You are not arguing for giving Bitcoin users more options. You are trying to take away an option that many people wish to use. Some who have wished to use it so much that they've been running patched versions of Bitcoin Core for years.\r\n\r\n> I think my view of the world is more consistent with making the Bitcoin network work well, not just in this case but for future policy work (such as v3 transactions).\r\n\r\nAbove we have three different wallet authors with years of experience running wallets that have NACKed this pull-req, and they have made clear that there are numerous problems introduced by non-rbf transactions that full-rbf helps fix for them. Your view of the world is clearly not widely supported by actual wallet authors.\r\n \r\n> > Why wouldn't we try to get some data on what incentives actually look like when experimenting with policy is easier? Why are we trying to artificially restrict that process of experimentation?\r\n> \r\n> We could also give everyone a knob to control every policy rule we have, and I think that is foolish.\r\n\r\nWe _do_ give everyone policy knobs for tons of policies, including ones that are much less commonly relevant to wallets than this one like the `datacarrier` and `datacarriersize`, the dust relay fee, four different options for descendant limits, etc.\r\n\r\nWhy is `mempoolfullrbf` - a rare knob with *clear use-cases outlined by three different wallet authors* special in this regard?\r\n\r\n> Which is why I have been consistently asking for the use case of fullrbf, given that we already have opt-in rbf. It seems that the main use case for fullrbf that you and I both agree on is users making mistakes, perhaps from using wallet software that doesn't opt-in, and then regretting it later when they can't feebump/replace their transaction.\r\n\r\nYou have clear use-cases for full-rbf from three different wallet authors. One use-case so clear that someone above mentioned how they are already running a full-rbf patch to help get transactions unstuck. It's obvious that being able to double spend and cancel all types of transactions is extremely useful, given that there is no guarantee that a low-fee transation will ever be mined.\r\n\r\n> (There is also the privacy angle that you mentioned, but I think that argument is weak, as wallets have a coordination problem for how they set these fields in a transaction regardless of whether opt-in is a policy or not, and I don't think the opt-in flag meaningfully changes that.)\r\n\r\nWhy are we harming everyone's privacy for a use-case that literally just two wallets spoke up in support of, one of which effectively argued that replacement should be removed entirely?\r\n\r\n> While I agree that such mistakes are bad, they seem avoidable and I think it's a weak rationale; the whole point of opt-in RBF is to give users a way to avoid the situation.\r\n\r\n...and as multiple wallet authors told you, as long as opt-in RBF is a second class citizen we have to deal with those mistakes.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, let's be clear: there is a significant component of the community that looks at that discrimination and thinks it's good to end it entirely by simply adopting full-rbf widely. Your pull-req is trying to take an option *away* from that part of the community.\r\n\r\nWhy are you so interested in denying them the ability to choose?\r\n\r\n> For my part, I'm open to being wrong about this -- I'm specifically looking for a development philosophy that is consistent with both moving towards fullrbf that is consistent with where I see future policy development going, such as for the v3 case that I've brought up several times. I've yet to see such a philosophy articulated in a way that I can understand, and almost every commenter has ignored this line of thinking, which all makes me believe that no one thus far is thinking about this adequately.\r\n\r\nThe v3 use-case may not be incentive compatible. That's ok. We can better have that discussion by learning more about full-rbf in practice.\r\n\r\nv3 is _not_ set in stone at this point, and there's probably lots of ways to achieve that goal. You seem to be dead set on v3 existing, so much that you're trying to take options away from people that may show that v3 as currently described isn't a good idea.\r\n\r\n> Alternatively, if you have a philosophy that would suggest that all the work we're doing on package rbf/package relay/v3 transactions is a big waste of time, then that would be helpful to hear as well, because maybe all that work is misguided and we should give up coordinating policy on a decentralized network. (It would be good think about the implications of this for layer 2 projects like lightning.) If you predict, for instance, that user mistakes and privacy concerns in the future will mean that people will work to subvert alternate policies like v3 once they're deployed, it'd be better to establish that now and save a lot of dev work.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it would be better to establish that now! I **highly** doubt that all work on package relay is pointless, as it obviously is a useful idea regardless of whether or not there is an RBF flag. But yes, the v3 rules might not work, and full-rbf might prove that to us. Better to find out now.\r\n\r\nConversely, v3 - unlike zeroconf - does not depend on *everyone* following the same set rigid of rules. So from that perspective, it's obvious that v3 *may* be able to work in situations where zeroconf does not.\r\n\r\n> > All pinning is about preventing transactions from getting mined at all. Full-RBF clearly can't make that problem worse. And it's clear that while it doesn't entirely prevent it in the multi-party scenario, it gets us closer to a solution.\r\n> \r\n> Pinning arises in two ways: an adversary trying to abuse our rules, or a coordination problem between sender and recipient. I believe the latter is far more common than the former, as people have been complaining about pinning since we deployed opt-in RBF. Offering tools to help prevent pinning with better coordination seems obviously useful.\r\n\r\nYou still haven't explained how offering more ways to get a transaction mined will make pinning worse.\r\n\r\nEqually, if - as an example - everyone switched to full-rbf tomorrow, we'd be in exactly the same situation as we are now re: pinning as opt-in-rbf and full-rbf are identical except for that flag. (relevant: it's impossible to spend certain types of outputs without enabling the opt-in-rbf flag, as we overloading the meaning of nSequence)",

I don't think one LN wallet using or not using the opt-in flag means much. I just checked and all my lightning channels on my LND nodes were opened with opt-in-rbf.\r\n\r\nClearly the better way to fix this footgun is to fix the underlying problem of making sure it's possible to properly cancel/feebump a LN funding tx, as we fundamentally can't prevent users who go to the trouble of importing a seed in a different wallet (!!) to try to cancel a transaction, from getting their transaction broadcast.\r\n\r\nFull-RBF nodes exist. We can't stop that now.",

This would allow our app to turn off RBF only when merchants specify to... but none of this will work if mempools force optin rbf.\r\n\r\nThe authors of Green, Electrum, and Trezor all NACKed this pull-req for the obvious reason that no amount of \"required feerate\", etc. can change the fact that transactions get stuck sometimes due to high demand and need to be feebumped/cancelled. Full-RBF is the only reasonable way to do this. Which is exactly why one of the people who NACKed this pull-req has been running full-rbf nodes for years, to help people get their transactions unstuck.\r\n\r\n...and let's be clear: you're supporting this pull-req because you have a *future* product that will rely on zeroconf. Pulling `fullrbf` from v24.0 will simply delay this discussion even further, creating a bigger mess of a debate in the future when you have yet another dangerous service trying to risk-manage zeroconf. Most likely a failing service because the idea is inherently unreliable.",

It needs to be globally enforced so that some type of guarantee can be given to users, and transactions themselves should specify the max-age.\r\n\r\nIn other words, clients should allow users to tweak the max-age of their transactions, up to the global value that miners enforce. And it'd be cool if merchants can also suggest values themselves to clients, so that a ~~store~~ seller could tell ~~shoppers~~ buyers, \"we'll wait up to 24hours for your txn to confirm\". **EDIT: but stores should still use LN instead. 😁**",

Getting a fee bump or cancel tx mined is the only reliable solution, and that needs full-rbf.\n\nAnyway, this discussion is both very stale - we've discussed these issues ad-nauseum over the years - and off topic for this pull-req.\n",

      "body": "> > This goal can also alternatively be achieved by lowering the mempool expiry time: just as a connected subgraph of fullrbf peers would allow you to broadcast a replacement tx; a connected subgraph of peers with a low expiry time, would also allow you to broadcast a replacement, and would allow you to do so without the other BIP 125 restrictions, such as having to increase the absolute fee, or not being able to conflict more than 100 descendants or not being able to introduce new unconfirmed parents.\r\n\r\n> Why are we discussing a convoluted alternative with clearly worse outcomes than just running full-rbf? That's not a like-for-like alternative to what these users want to do.\r\n\r\nIn a technical discussion, you discuss possible alternatives so that you better understand both the goal that people are trying to achieve, and the different tradeoffs different approaches offer.\r\n\r\nAn obvious tradeoff between bip125-rbf whether signalled or not and shorter expiry, is that shorter expiry allows a much broader range of replacement options (ie, anything that would violate rules 2-5 despite being more attractive to miners) at a cost of replacement still not being available for some days. When opt-in RBF was first supported, the mempool expiry time was 3 days; it was changed two releases later to 2 weeks.\r\n\r\n> Is it because you are concerned that providing the option at all would harm zeroconf? Let's be clear here.\r\n\r\nI don't think questioning contributors' motives is a constructive use of github, and nor is [brigading](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1588466116749578240) of this PR with content free NACKs or ACKs. The thing we should be being clear about here is the technical consequences of proposed changes, and those approaches aren't conducive to improved technical understanding. If you don't want to have a technical conversation, there are plenty of other more suitable places. Of course, that's just my view; if the folks merging PRs do somehow consider this useful information, that's a different matter.",

      "body": "> @ariard I don't understand what you mean here. The philosophy I'm articulating is one where, at least in this software project, we try to keep policy rules in sync with one another, generally only deviating in situations where node resources become an issue (so keeping flags for minimum relay fee, maximum mempool size, and perhaps transaction chain limits are probably fine -- as those only serve to interfere with relay for transactions that would have poor relay propagation properties anyway).\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar To give illustrations to the aforementioned intuition of \"transactions flows bypassing policies\", let's say you have a non replaceable batch transaction paying to N third-party outputs and 1 change output. The transaction issuer opted out from replacement according to BIP 125 rules, as such allowing chain of transactions with some degree of reliability. After few minutes of propagation, the issuer observes a sudden change in Lightning public channels congestion, realizing it would be more economically profitable to replace the batch transaction with a new version of the batch, splitting the change output in M channel funding outputs to earn LN routing fees. This new version won't propagate on the p2p network due to the previous version opting out from BIP 125 replacement, therefore the batch issuer calls on private transaction-relay communication channels directly towards miners offering this service, attaching a compelling mining fee to evict out potential chain of transaction (where the overhead mining fee is still under the expected gain of LN routing fees).\r\n\r\nThis is a first illustration. A second one coming to my mind, current `MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY` payload allows 83 bytes. OpenTimestamps-like, timestamping proof use-cases could target to experiment commitment with accumulator proof membership more efficient than the one proposed with Merkle Tree, i.e with a lengthier root state, while still conserving the publicity property of the chain. Those use-cases would again calls on private-transaction-relay communication channels directly towards miners known accepting non-bounded OP_RETURN payload, attaching a compelling mining fee, or offering an adequate out-of-band fees.\r\n\r\nThose two illustrations aim to make the point that some policy rules design could create viable incentive to relay transactions privately to miners, and as such generate long-term asymmetries between miners. I still wonder if the mining asymmetries we're creating are only present in the case when we're introducing special replacement/relay regime (e.g BIP125 or nVersion=3) or also when we're allowing operators to manage node resources (e.g minimum relay fee, maximum mempool size), if such conceptual distinction holds. I don't think this is because we wouldn't be able to design policies to accommodate all the use cases we can come up with, rather the fact that some Bitcoin transaction issuers might have incentives (defined differently than miners ones) to bypass policy rules.\r\n\r\n> Thanks for responding to this point, because I didn't expect after the recent discussion on ways to pin a coinjoin transaction that you would still think fullrbf is a solution. (Furthermore, if we adopted a relay policy like I proposed in #26451, I think the pinning problem would get much, much worse, which further emphasizes the issue that pinning problems are hard to solve.)\r\n\r\nTo bring clarity, I never expected fullrbf to be a complete solution to the pinning of coinjoin transaction, as I noted in my initial fullrbf proposal a year ago [[0]](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-June/019074.html). I rather saw it as one step in a broader systematic elimination of pinning vectors (BIP125 rule 3, BIP125 rule 5) annoying coinjoin and contracting protocols. After the recent discussions, sounds we need more thoughts about our transaction-relay philosophy, and if crafting policy to each use-case is a more sustainable paradigm.\r\n\r\n> For clarity to everyone else, I think it's helpful if we can establish what the coinjoin/multiparty funding transaction model is that you're working with, because it took me a few iterations of offline dis> cussion with @instagibbs to understand the issue. (Also, if my understanding is different than what you're thinking about, this would be a good time to get on the same page.)\r\n\r\nThe model I've in mind is the interactive construction protocol as specified out by the Lightning development community: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/851. It can be used as a building block for p2p coinjoin, Lightning dual-funded/splicing.\r\n\r\n> I believe the example of the coinjoin protocol you're thinking about is one where anonymous users express interest in a coinjoin, and start with some sort of signing round where they coordinate a transaction with inputs and outputs they each provide. (I'm guessing there are various timeouts and such so that if one party stalls, they get dropped from the transaction, and the rest of the group continues.)\r\n> \r\n> Once the inputs and signatures have been verified to look good to everyone -- perhaps there's a requirement that all the inputs are confirmed, and that all the inputs pass the standardness rules of Bitcoin Core -- then a coordinator will broadcast the transaction on the network. The coordinator wants to be able to do this, and have it succeed, without having to inspect its own mempool, and without connecting to other nodes to see what it is in their mempools. As time passes, the coordinator may rbf this transaction to try to increase the likelihood that it confirms (it's not clear to me how this happens, do the other participants pre-sign feebumped versions initially?).\r\n\r\nThis is a clear model, I think until then we agree on. Effectively, all the inputs (and outputs) should pass the standardness rules of Bitcoin Core, otherwise you have a DoS vector where a participant can contribute a non-standard element, failing the transaction broadcast. Current interactive construction protocol v0.1 as specified out by Lightning relies on RBF as a fee-bumping technique. However, the addition of an anchor output spendable by the coordinator can be done discretionary, with all the shenanigans of the carve-out rule coming in. Pre-signing multiple feebumped versions is not part of the current spec, though it has been envisioned by Ligthning developers in recent discussions about second-stage HTLC transactions, and it could be adopted here.\r\n\r\n> The problem arises when a user or group of users (or a user pretending to be a group of users, and able to take multiple inputs of the transaction) can indefinitely stall the protocol, by relaying a low feerate transaction that cannot be feebumped away, and which doesn't confirm on its own for a long time. The question is, how might an adversary achieve this (and at what cost), and what tools are available to protocol designers to prevent it?\r\n\r\nFor a recent discussion on how an adversary can achieve this, and what tools are available to protocol designers/application developers to prevent this, see https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021142.html and https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021170.html. Especially, between the choice of defensive architecture/mempools inspecting protocols, at the end of the day it's likely a question of economic affordability to the end user.\r\n\r\n> The limitation of not inspecting your own or any other node's mempool to see what transactions are relayed on the public network is a significant limitation, and while I can understand why it would be very useful if we could design a protocol in this way, I'm not sure that limitation is one that the network should accept as a reason to enforce a policy on everyone. But putting that aside, the pinning issues that exist even in a fullrbf world would make this protocol vulnerable to stalling all the same, albeit at greater cost than in a non-fullrbf world. The example I gave on the mailing list was that an adversary could pin the coinjoin transaction by relaying a double-spend that was large and had low feerate. If we adopted something like #26451, then this pin would be extremely effective if the adversary chained a single low fee, but high feerate transaction to their double-spend (under the rules I proposed in #26451, the replacement transaction would both need to be high fee to pay for all the fees being removed from the mempool, and high feerate to satisfy the incentive compatibility heuristic - even though the transactions generated by the adversary might not be mined for a long time, because the ancestor feerate of the child might be very low).\r\n\r\nThis pinning vector due to high-fee/low-feerate double-spend was noted in my initial fullrbf proposal, as an additional concern to address on top of fullrbf. Effectively, the rules as proposed in #26451 would modify the cost for an adversary.\r\n\r\n> I also mentioned on the mailing list that an adversary with multiple inputs into the coinjoin could use the 100 transaction limit to prevent any rbf from occurring at all. The cost of this might not be very high, because the 100 transactions used can all be small.\r\n\r\nWhile I think we have considered the 100 transaction limit numerous time on how it could affect the LN commitment transaction as a pinning, from my knowledge it has never been considered in the funding flow of coinjoin transactions. Thanks to bring it in to awareness!\r\n\r\n> And finally just recently I thought of a new DoS attack that you could run into, which is that an adversary can use RBF to keep your coinjoin transaction out of the network's mempools, without ever actuall> y having their coinjoin input double-spent in a mined block. Imagine the coinjoin transaction is relayed on the network and in everyone's mempool. The adversary can double-spend their input in a higher fee> /higher feerate transaction that includes multiple inputs. Then they double-spend that transaction by conflicting with one of the other inputs that were spending, resulting in a situation where the coinjoi> n transaction would be eligible for inclusion in node mempools (because there are no longer any conflicting spends of its inputs), but due to relay optimizations no node would reannounce or relay the trans> action for a while, at least until the next block is mined. For an adversary that is willing to issue one transaction at the prevailing block fees each block, the coinjoin could be stalled indefinitely wit> h no ability to detect which user is causing the problem, assuming your model is that you don't inspect the mempool.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of this one is the coinjoin double-spend is itself double-spent thanks to an unconfirmed input. To achieve its pinning effect, the coinjoin double-spend only have to be present in the network mempools at propagation time of the honest coinjoin by the coordinator. The propagation time of the honest coinjoin can be likely predicted by the adversary, and the usual flooding time across the network as much, therefore giving strong knowledge when the unconfirmed input of the pinning transaction must be evicted from network mempools. There is a non-null odd a block is mined during this interval, though Ibelieve the edge is in favor of the adversary to keep the pinning \"silent\" from mined blocks. Note, I think even if you assume a model where the local mempool is inspect, I think you can partition its view of the rest of the network by creating conflicting versions of the unconfirmed input of the coinjoin double-spend itself.\r\n\r\n> I don't know if you think that all these attacks are too costly for anyone to bother with, but it seems to me that it would make more sense to iron out the deficiencies in our RBF policies and try to improve them first and decide what level of attacker costs you're concerned with, before asking the network to try to address this use case, since it seems like fullrbf is not going to be enough. Moreover, based on recent mailing list discussion, it seems like the existing coinjoin implementations out there don't even signal for RBF on their transactions and aren't worried about these kinds of DoS vectors at the moment [1] [2].\r\n\r\nIn a future world where p2p coinjoin/multi-party Lightning funding transactions are offered in a peer-to-peer/permissionless fashion by services nodes (in the same way we have a LN routing node market with its own risks of channel jammings), I think those attacks have reasonable odds to happen, as the attacker might be able to earn a substituting service fee. I think it might make more sense to craft out the deficiencies in our RBF policies, though I think the fullrbf as solution itself to remove one pinning vector should stay an open question. It sounds to me laying out better what could be a transaction-relay policy design philosophy and its robustness in face of a consistent modeling of mining incentives are likely some of the next steps in the discussion.\r\n\r\nWhile it seems the existing coinjoin implementations operators are not worried of these kinds of DoS vectors, reading the reports it sounds more because they have existent DoS at the application-level. Mentalities could evolve quickly in the light of sustained pinning attacks against the services. Of course, this kind of DoS vector isn't the most urgent safety issue affecting multi-party applications and contracting protocols, though we had to pick up one and start somewhere, initially it sounded a low-hanging fruit one. I'm still personally concerned that multi-party transaction being speced out by the Lightning community and expected to be supported by LN wallets in a middle-term timeline could make the DoS vectors far more sensible to solve.  \r\n\r\n> I think this is already possible in a fullrbf world, due to the ease with which someone can construct two transactions that are mutually non-replaceable under our current rules (if transaction A has higher feerate than B, but B has greater fees than A, then neither one will displace the other.). Perhaps I don't follow what your security model is for this concern?\r\n\r\nI don't deny it would be possible in a fullrbf world due to the exact same trick you'e raising. There has been recent research of fee-estimator more efficient than the Bitcoin Core based on real-time mempools trends, however without relying on buckets updated each blocks]. Such class of fee-estimators would be indeed exposed to deliberate partitioning, how to protect them is an open question. Also how it could be a building block for advanced pinnings. This could be solvable with some \"mempool-sync\" where fullrbf could be a prerequisite, and this might not be the best approach. This is low priority to me, though still a potential long-term concern.\r\n\r\n> I completely agree that a problem we are running into is that the notion of what \"incentive compatible\" means is not well-defined. I have attempted to articulate a philosophy of how I think we can work to > meet different use cases that may not be incentive compatible if they were the only deployed policy on the network, but that I think are incentive compatible in the sense that users should have no need to > subvert their flaws in the presence of policy options that meet their use case. If people don't think my philosophy works, I'd be interested to hear of other philosophies that are workable to meet use case> s on the network. Thus far I'm not aware of any single set of policy rules that we could apply to all transactions that would satisfy the current use cases on the network (and please note that I'm ignoring> the idea of \"zeroconf\" as a use case, which I think is a business practice that is not directly tied to any particular set of relay policies -- I'm thinking instead of CPFP, coinjoins, lightning, fee bumping, etc).\r\n\r\nI think I start to understand better the idea to have isolated policy regime for use-case, well-designed enough that users of let's say policy A does not have an incentive to subvert policy B to meet their use case. Where I still wonder, and where I might diverge is about the \"intra-policy\" usage itself. I.e a user of policy A competing against another user of policy A (e.g a LN channel counterparty exploiting the artificial nVersion=3 package limits), to gain an economic or security advantage. This is a subject definitely warrant of more thoughts. And I think I'm converging on dissociating structured patterns of transactions (like CPFP/coinjoin/lightning) from the application processing of those chains of transactions (zeroconf). It should be noted Lightning also introduced 0conf opening channel this year (instead of the default of 6 blocks).\r\n\r\n> I completely disagree with this! If you want to limit CPU DoS surface, don't relay transactions. It would be absurd to me that censoring a type of transaction would be a culture we'd want to promote in our>  project, for such a flimsy reason.\r\n\r\nLet's explain more the type of L1/L2 node architecture I'm thinking of. In terms of second-layers protocols like Lightning, we have a concern of _cross-layer_ link, a type of privacy leak allowing an adversary to map your LN node to your Bitcoin Core full-node, and from then escalate to more sophisticated attacks like pinning. One potential mitigation is to deploy multiple full-nodes, one full-node used for your fee-estimation only, another for your transaction broadcast, another for your block-relay only, as such leveling the bar for an attacker to cross-layer your infrastructure. In that deployment paradigm, you would like your transaction broadcast full-node to be as much robust as you would like, as the transaction are time-sensitive (e.g in Lightning, the justice transaction should confirm before expiration of the CSV delay encumbering the counterparty funds). Reducing the DoS surface by taking all the more conservative policy options sounds a reasonable choice to me from a node operator risk-management perspective.\r\n\r\nI can understand this is an engineering culture different than the current Bitcoin Core one, though note I'm coming from the Lightning ecosystem where enforcing stricter routing policies on HTLC forward is a standard reasoning.",

      "body": "While being the author of `mempoolfullrbf` and the preferential peering patchset, I'm Concept ACK on removing this option from Bitcoin Core, as motivated [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26287#issuecomment-1301518418).\r\n\r\nI think Bitcoin protocol development is to build and iron out consensus, and in the present case there is a clear lack of it. While the feature has already been merged, there have been since then far more wonders raised. Some questioning deeply what should be our transaction-relay design philosophy in face of Bitcoin use-cases gaining in complexity and diversity. From my perspective, this is far more valuable to re-build a common understanding on how to address pinning vectors, what is the miners incentives model, what are the Bitcoin merchants practices and risks models, what should be the Bitcoin Core communication process in case of significant policy upgrades, what the flow of contracting protocols and the type of DoS vectors they're exposed, what should be the level of mempool policy rules setting flexibility offered by Bitcoin Core towards node operators and few more questions. This is really true, that any part of the mining ecosystem could still turn on `mempoolfullrbf` by default, however I think this would bring new information in the qualification of miner incentives, not settle many more questions raised above. \r\n\r\nI can't speak as an expert of Bitcoin Core release process, though I don't think there is a \"solidfied\" right to a feature once being merged on the main branch, and only included in the RCs. I think from now on the conversation is far more productive to be held on the mailing list, with concrete, historical examples of why removing the option would be contrary to Bitcoin Core release process, or even if it's a precedent on all the short-term/long-term implications it would constitute for the project decision-making process.",

By your definition every time a block is found there is a \"chain split\", as not all miners have the block instantaneously. That is not \"causing\" a chain split. That's just making the inevitable one-block difference in consensus take slightly longer.\r\n\r\nMiners regularly mine blocks containing transactions not already seen by the rest of the network. Indeed, because the mempool doesn't have consensus, and it's common for conflicting transactions to exist that can't be resolved by fee, this is inevitable. Particularly if someone chooses to broadcast a lot of divergent transactions.\r\n\r\nWhat full-rbf does do is reduce the chance of a divergence in a subset of the problem, when one transaction pays a sufficiently higher fee than the other. It also discourages zeroconf attackers from doing that, by simply making zeroconf not a thing.",

Full RBF simplifies mempool policy and aids the development of multiparty contract protocols. These protocols will be essential in spreading adoption and usability of bitcoin. Zero-conf txs are insecure and do nothing to increase bitcoin adoption. It's 2022, if you need instant bitcoin transactions you need to run a lightning node.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, removing the full RBF flag permits the continued concealment of a consensus-compatible local capability that node runners already have. This strikes me as a deceptive, user-unfriendly dark pattern that should not be permitted in a free and open protocol. This is the kind of behavior I expect from monopolistic software service companies. Bitcoin should do better.",

The trade-off there is between the increased risk of mining a stale block and the fee revenue lost.\r\n\r\nNo, the hyper-rational thing to do is to work out the increase in stale rate per byte of transaction, and ensure that the bump in fees is high enough to be worth the tiny increase in stale rate. The easiest way to accomplish that would be to just increase the minimum mining fee for your node to something that actually makes a difference to revenue.\r\n\r\nOf course, doing that can make double-spending quite easy...",

That's not a like-for-like alternative to what these users want to do.\r\n> \r\n> In a technical discussion, you discuss possible alternatives so that you better understand both the goal that people are trying to achieve, and the different tradeoffs different approaches offer.\r\n>\r\n> An obvious tradeoff between bip125-rbf whether signalled or not and shorter expiry, is that shorter expiry allows a much broader range of replacement options (ie, anything that would violate rules 2-5 despite being more attractive to miners) at a cost of replacement still not being available for some days. When opt-in RBF was first supported, the mempool expiry time was 3 days; it was changed two releases later to 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, you can't rely on transaction expiration because anyone else can just rebroadcast the transaction. Indeed, we've seen this happen before! That's why I said it's a convoluted alternative with clearly worse outcomes. Even if it did work, you're suggesting that users wait _multiple days_ at minimum for a chance at getting their transaction mined; two weeks with the current expiration time.\r\n\r\nNo-one has raised any technological reasons why wallets like @greenaddress shouldn't simply use full-rbf. They and other wallets clearly want to offer their users this capability, and the capability has helped users in the past.\r\n\r\n> > Is it because you are concerned that providing the option at all would harm zeroconf? Let's be clear here.\r\n> \r\n> I don't think questioning contributors' motives is a constructive use of github, and nor is [brigading](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1588466116749578240) of this PR with content free NACKs or ACKs. The thing we should be being clear about here is the technical consequences of proposed changes, and those approaches aren't conducive to improved technical understanding. If you don't want to have a technical conversation, there are plenty of other more suitable places. Of course, that's just my view; if the folks merging PRs do somehow consider this useful information, that's a different matter.\r\n\r\nWhen someone proposes what appears to be clearly worse solution, without any technical reasons as to why, it helps the conversation along if we discuss what are the actual reasons for proposing that solution. Now, if you want to protect zeroconf, go ahead and say it. But if you don't, you have not brought to the table any reason why we should put up arbitrary roadblocks in the way of wallets like @greenaddress to use full-rbf.",

Core is not here to anticipate or steer how Bitcoin is used, it is here to be a maximally useful tool while being as simple as possible.\n\nJust because code is able to do something does not make it necessary or appropriate at the protocol level.

You don't know if other miners and nodes in between do the same. If they pick the higher fee and you don't, your block propagates more slowly. If you stick to the lower fee and they don't, same problem. If you leave the transaction out entirely you're safer (at an opportunity cost). The choice is between picking the higher fee version, picking the lower fee version and avoiding both. (this sounds completely impractical to implement though)\r\n\r\nNote that this is not an argument for or against `-fullrbf`. It's an argument for having a single choice emerge.",

      "body": "> When someone proposes what appears to be clearly worse solution, without any technical reasons as to why, it helps the conversation along if we discuss what are the actual reasons for proposing that solution. Now, if you want to protect zeroconf, go ahead and say it.\r\n\r\nGiven I was the proposer of #26323, I think it's pretty absurd to cast me as a protector of zeroconf.\r\n\r\nMy goals are:\r\n * I think bitcoin core should be making changes that enable new, useful use cases. Disappointingly, full rbf as currently specced doesn't do that: the pinning attacks that this was aiming to solve remain possible, and ordinary replacement is already solved by opt-in rbf.\r\n * If a PR was merged without sufficient review -- that is, it turns out later that it doesn't do what it was described to do in the PR, and that wasn't caught in review -- then I think it should either be fixed (so that it does solve the problem it was designed to) or, if that's not possible, reverted. There shouldn't be a benefit to sneaking a PR in without proper review.\r\n * I think bitcoin core shouldn't be making changes that come as a surprise to users and risk causing them significant financial harm, absent some emergency, even if the way they're using bitcoin is stupid. There's no emergency here, so I think if we were to go ahead with this change, we should hold off for 6 months (or some other non-trivial timeframe).\r\n * I think bitcoin core should be aiming towards consistent mempool policies: if we think fullrbf is a good thing, it should be the default in the software we release; if we don't think it's a good thing, we shouldn't support it at all. There's other node software out there with a different philosophy, and that's fine -- people can use that if they want. I expect that to generally provide a worse experience, if the difference is noticeable at all.\r\n * If bitcoin core doesn't want to aim towards consistent mempool policies, and does want to have knobs so people can tune choose their own relay policy, then I think we should be forthright about that, as it's significantly different to past practice.\r\n\r\nAll of these things seem fairly straightforwardly desirable to me, even if you take \"zeroconf delenda est\" as your guiding principle.\r\n\r\nOf course, one reason to be against any or all of them is if you care more about some competitor to bitcoin: bitcoin handling new use cases is just more competition for you; review missing design problems and bugs is already a PR win and if devs don't even do anything about them that's even better; making surprising changes that stops businesses from using bitcoin is both new potential customers for you, and an opportunity to discourage unrelated people from considering bitcoin; inconsistent mempool policies is a great way to make tx relay even more unreliable; and not being forthright about policy changes is just an opportunity to stir up more drama later.\r\n\r\n> But if you don't, you have not brought to the table any reason why we should put up arbitrary roadblocks [...]\r\n\r\nI've written at length about all of the above both on the list and in various PRs on this topic.",

Bitcoin core v23 doesn't facilitate the users' will because it forces users to run patched or forked versions in order to express their will. The proposed v24 with `-mempoolfullrbf` better reflects the users' will, but still biases (through its default) in the direction that you prefer.\r\n\r\nYou yourself said that core should be neutral. This PR (removing `-mempoolfullrbf`) increases core's bias. Do we have your NACK on this PR to prevent that increase in bias?",

      "body": "@ajtowns \r\n\r\n> > When someone proposes what appears to be clearly worse solution, without any technical reasons as to why, it helps the conversation along if we discuss what are the actual reasons for proposing that solution. Now, if you want to protect zeroconf, go ahead and say it.\r\n> \r\n> Given I was the proposer of #26323, I think it's pretty absurd to cast me as a protector of zeroconf.\r\n\r\nPeople change their minds. You're actions right now are consistent with trying to protect continued uses of zeroconf, and indeed, you even say so below:\r\n\r\n> My goals are:\r\n> \r\n>     * I think bitcoin core should be making changes that enable new, useful use cases. Disappointingly, full rbf as currently specced doesn't do that: the pinning attacks that this was aiming to solve remain possible, and ordinary replacement is already solved by opt-in rbf.\r\n\r\nI find it extremely disrespectful to the wallet authors that have spoken up with clear usecases for full-rbf that you and others continue to say that replacement is solved by opt-in RBF.  It obviously is not for the precise reason that opt-in RBF transactions get discriminated against, people have a reasonable desire to send without that bit, and some of the time those transactions get stuck and need fixing.\r\n\r\nAlso, re: the pinning attacks, as we all know full-rbf does in fact eliminate large classes of them, and thus forces attackers to use more expensive attacks that tie up more funds. It also of course eliminates unintentional attacks where transactions are double-spent by accident (eg by people importing seeds into different wallets, something that *has* happened regularly with Wasabi).\r\n\r\nFinally, the default-off `mempoolfullrbf`option was of course *not* intended to solve these attacks directly! Obviously a default-off option doesn't itself solve attacks. What it does do - in the context of multi-party protocols - is give easy ways for devs and users to experiment with full-rbf behavior.\r\n\r\nThat there are still some questions around that specific use case does *not* justify the removal of that widely desired option.\r\n\r\n>     * If a PR was merged without sufficient review -- that is, it turns out later that it doesn't do what it was described to do in the PR, and that wasn't caught in review -- then I think it should either be fixed (so that it does solve the problem it was designed to) or, if that's not possible, reverted. There shouldn't be a benefit to sneaking a PR in without proper review.\r\n\r\nAgain, the default-off `mempoolfullrbf` flag has very well understood behavior that people have been reviewing for years. The four different wallet authors who have NACKed this pull-req are completely familiar with what it does; we all know the (lack of) impact it will have on the network as a whole from a technical perspective. Questions around a specific use-case do not constitute insufficient review. \r\n\r\nYou can't seriously argue that full-rbf needs to be \"fixed\" to achieve the goals people want to use it for.\r\n\r\n>     * I think bitcoin core shouldn't be making changes that come as a surprise to users and risk causing them significant financial harm, absent some emergency, even if the way they're using bitcoin is stupid. There's no emergency here, so I think if we were to go ahead with this change, we should hold off for 6 months (or some other non-trivial timeframe).\r\n\r\nThe effect of your actions in NACKing this pull-req are to protect continued use of zeroconf. As is easy to see on Twitter, Reddit, etc. the fact that zeroconf is insecure is widely known. But a small minority of people like @BitcoinErrorLog are trying to argue that it is in fact secure. By pulling this default off option, you are inevitably sending a message that Bitcoin Core is in fact in control of mempool policies that make zeroconf secure.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to minimize this risk, we'd simply ship with full-rbf enabled, and make the fact that we're doing that very public to eliminate usage of zeroconf as fast as possible. The fact is you are doing the exact opposite, increasing the total exposure to this risk.\r\n\r\n>     * I think bitcoin core should be aiming towards consistent mempool policies: if we think fullrbf is a good thing, it should be the default in the software we release; if we don't think it's a good thing, we shouldn't support it at all. There's other node software out there with a different philosophy, and that's fine -- people can use that if they want. I expect that to generally provide a worse experience, if the difference is noticeable at all.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly a case where getting consensus over mempool policies is difficult for *political* reasons, not technical. And far from providing a worse experience, multiple wallet authors have spoken up with clear use-cases where it provides a better user experience.\r\n\r\nThe obvious thing to do with that kind of political disagreement is provide the option for people to use. With more use, we'll probably be able to resolve this disagreement with actual usage rather than endless theoretical discussions on GitHub.\r\n\r\n>     * If bitcoin core doesn't want to aim towards consistent mempool policies, and does want to have knobs so people can tune choose their own relay policy, then I think we should be forthright about that, as it's significantly different to past practice.\r\n\r\nThe fact is Core has lots of knobs to control relay policy, including many knobs controlling things with a much smaller interested audience than full-rbf.  Past practice on Bitcoin Core clearly allows people to pick mempool policies.\r\n\r\nWhere is this discussion of knobs going anyway? As you well know, we already ship with settings like the maximum mempool size and min relay fees that, if set, make zeroconf unreliable. Are you planning on removing those settings?\r\n\r\n> Of course, one reason to be against any or all of them is if you care more about some competitor to bitcoin:\r\n\r\n> bitcoin handling new use cases is just more competition for you;\r\n\r\nYou are clearly interfering with desirable use-cases by taking away this option.\r\n\r\n> review missing design problems and bugs is already a PR win and if devs don't even do anything about them that's even better;\r\n\r\nWhat are you trying to insinuate here?\r\n\r\n> making surprising changes that stops businesses from using bitcoin is both new potential customers for you, and an opportunity to discourage unrelated people from considering bitcoin;\r\n\r\nSurprising? We've been telling people for years that zeroconf is insecure. Full-RBF is not surprising for anyone who isn't in the tiny minority trying to accept it.\r\n\r\nAre you saying you expect *more* people to start relying on zeroconf? And that it's a good thing? Because that's how this reads.\r\n\r\n> inconsistent mempool policies is a great way to make tx relay even more unreliable;\r\n\r\nFull-RBF nodes are entirely compatible with opt-in-rbf nodes. How specifically does full-rbf make tx relay \"even more unreliable\"?\r\n\r\n> and not being forthright about policy changes is just an opportunity to stir up more drama later.\r\n\r\nWe're talking about a default-off option. That is not a policy change.\r\n",

      "body": "I’ll start with a summary of how I see the review feedback here. I’d broadly categorize the most common responses expressing support for `-mempoolfullrbf` in the following ways:\r\n1) Zeroconf is bad or unsafe, and we must send that message and/or give users and miners tools to exploit it because it’s the rational thing to do. This was the overwhelming majority of the reasons given (and it seems most commenters are unable to grasp that defending zeroconf business practices is not an argument I was making).\r\n2) Even though users can choose to enable RBF for their transactions already, something about the current ecosystem results in users making mistakes and not making this choice, and then later regretting it.  This could be because: wallets don’t have good defaults; this whole topic of replaceability vs. non-replaceability is confusing to users and they choose the wrong thing; or some services encourage users to set their wallets this way.  It also could be because zeroconf merchants incentivize users to signal non-replacement (to receive favorable treatment from the merchant) and then use RBF to reclaim their funds, but only a few commenters acknowledged this use case.\r\n3) It’s privacy enhancing to get rid of a distinguishing characteristic of transactions.\r\n\r\nThere were also circular answers given for why we should offer this as a flag, namely that users of our software demand it (why do they?), or that fullrbf is inevitable (why?), and therefore we must support it eventually.\r\n\r\nThere were also several comments that seemed to indicate clear misconceptions as the justification for why we should have fullrbf, which I’ll gloss over quickly: some thought this PR would eliminate all forms of RBF, or that this PR implies we are trusting miners to not follow their incentives (perhaps worth debating, but not an assumption built into this), or that the only possible utility from a non-replacement signal is if a user trusted that it would be confirmed (or give users a “false sense of security”) – this ignores the points I raised on why non-replacement can be useful, and also ignores evidence that came up indicating that some modern wallets and protocols use non-signaling transactions in certain limited situations (such as for LN funding transactions or coinjoin protocols deployed today).  Another user thought that RBF should be opt-out only, and not opt-in, misunderstanding that our RBF policy today can equivalently be thought about as an opt-in or opt-out policy, because every transaction that is authored has to pick, via the choice of sequence values, whether it will be subject to RBF or not.\r\n\r\nAnother commenter mentioned that we should not incentivize the use of unconfirmed transactions. I thoroughly appreciate this comment, because I would be the first to agree that our software would be far simpler, and the network would work much better in many ways, if users were on board with us eliminating relay of transactions that spend unconfirmed outputs – the most visible form of “use of unconfirmed transactions” on the network today.  I have avoided proposing this because I believe that Bitcoin users would find this too restricting, but I would welcome others’ efforts to move Bitcoin’s culture in this way if it’s practical for the ecosystem.  This would make our RBF policy code much simpler, too, and would eliminate reasons to have a non-replacement policy – unless we then wanted to support some limited transaction chains, which would work much better for transactions that weren’t subject to replacement.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’ll get to what I think are the best reasons to oppose this PR.  I laid some of these out already in an earlier post, but I’ll restate them here more concisely.  It seems to me that we have not reached consensus about this PR, so in the interests of not holding up this project with more debate I thought I’d acknowledge what I believe to the best reasons to continue ahead with the `-mempoolfullrbf` flag in our code and continue with the 24.0 release with no further change on this front.\r\n\r\nFirst, this PR unfortunately has conflated two separate debates: whether we should be moving towards a fullrbf policy on the network, and regardless of that, whether it’s reasonable to offer this default-off command line option to our users.  My view on this is that if fullrbf as our default policy doesn’t make sense, then it also doesn’t make sense for us to offer it as an option, but I know that others might disagree with that logic.  I won’t repeat my arguments for why I think encouraging a more homogenous network policy and promoting broad standards for transaction makes sense for users to have a better experience transacting on the network, but I will acknowledge that the existence of debate on this point is a reason that (from a maintainer’s perspective) I’d expect this PR to have a high threshold to clear in order to be merged.\r\n\r\nSecond, I think there are logical reasons to want the network to be fullrbf:\r\n1) If you believe that miners will eventually mine non-signaling transactions due to the existence of zeroconf merchants whose business practices incentivize theft, then it’s rational to both want to support those miners now, and (if you’re a node operator) to also eventually run with the same policy the miners are running with, so that your mempool more closely matches what will happen on the network.\r\n2) The simplicity for Bitcoin users to not have to distinguish what it means for a transaction to be replaceable or not might be a real win for the Bitcoin user experience.  The idea that a transaction is “non-replaceable” as a factual matter is counter to Bitcoin’s consensus design, so wallets that present that choice are indeed communicating an incorrect message to users.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the objections I have to the concept of fullrbf on the network are philosophical in nature. I opened this PR to try to discuss the higher level protocol development concerns that come with decisions like this – such as how we evaluate incentive compatibility or meet disparate use cases (but disappointingly, reviewer feedback has largely avoided engaging on these points). And in thinking about the alternative, I don’t expect that offering a default-off flag is going to materially alter the network in the near term, as a practical matter.  I do still plan to raise these protocol development concerns in the future, if and when they are applicable again to work happening in this project.\r\n\r\nSo even though I remain unconvinced by the NACKs here, and despite what I see as deplorable behavior by some of the participants, I think it makes sense to close this PR due to lack of consensus, and my recommendation to maintainers would be to move forward with the 24.0 release without reverting #25353.\r\n",
