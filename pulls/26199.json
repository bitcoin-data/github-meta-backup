    "body": "This picks up the last commit from #19843.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we would prepare to self-announce to a new peer while parsing a `version` message from that peer.\r\nThis is redundant, because we do something very similar in `MaybeSendAddr()`, which is called from `SendMessages()` after\r\nthe version handshake is finished.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of differences:\r\n\r\n1) `MaybeSendAddr()` self-advertises to all peers we do address relay with, not just outbound ones.\r\n2) `GetLocalAddrForPeer()` called from `MaybeSendAddr()` makes a probabilistic decision to either advertise what they think we are or what we think we are, while `PushAddress()` on `version` deterministically only does the former if the address from the latter is unroutable.\r\n3) During `version` processing, we haven't received a potential sendaddrv2 message from our peer yet, so self-advertisements with addresses from addrV2-only networks would always be dropped in `PushAddress()`.\r\n\r\nSince it's confusing to have two slightly different mechanisms for self-advertising, and the one in `MaybeSendAddr()` is better, remove the one in `version`.",

      "message": "p2p: Don't self-advertise during VERSION processing\n\nPreviously, we would prepare to self-announce to a new peer while\nparsing a VERSION message from that peer. This is redundant, because we\ndo something very similar in MaybeSendAddr(), which is called from\nSendMessages() after the version handshake is finished.\n\nThere are a couple of differences:\n\n1) MaybeSendAddr() self-advertises to all peers we do address relay with,\n   not just outbound ones.\n2) GetLocalAddrForPeer() called from MaybeSendAddr() makes a\n   probabilistic decision to either advertise\n   what they think we are or what we think we are, while\n   PushAddress(self) on VERSION deterministically only does\n   the former if the address from the latter is unroutable.\n3) During VERSION processing, we haven't received a potential sendaddrv2 message\n   from our peer yet, so self-advertisements with addresses from addrV2-only networks\n   would always be dropped in PushAddress().\n\nSince it's confusing to have two slightly different mechanisms for self-advertising,\nand the one in MaybeSendAddr() is better, remove the one in VERSION.\n\nCo-authored-by: Martin Zumsande <mzumsande@gmail.com>",

At the same time, it *heavily relies* on `MaybSendAddr` to actually do something, not much would change if you drop the duplicate subset (what this PR does).\r\n\r\nOne real difference this could make is that due to the \"makes a probabilistic decision to either advertise what they think we are or what we think we are\" of this behavior, we could have ended up having two self-ads in one ADDR message (one added here, one added in `MaybeSendAddr` if they are different). I don't think this is a show-stopper for this PR. I don't think we want to preserve this behavior.\r\n\r\nUPD:\r\n\r\nAnother important difference could be the time between the two calls. This might make sense if there's a risk of someone inserting our self-ad (`PushAddress`) with the wrong metadata, eg `nTime`. Then our latter self-ad insertion would be dismissed (because we just look up the key), while the VERSION-one is protected from this issue.\r\nI don't think this is a show-stopper for this PR, although this surface could indeed be improved (e.g., handle duplicates better, or handle other-nodes-announce-us-through-us differently).",

      "body": "> One real difference this could make is that due to the \"makes a probabilistic decision to either advertise what they think we are or what we think we are\" of this behavior, we could have ended up having two self-ads in one ADDR message (one added here, one added in `MaybeSendAddr` if they are different). I don't think this is a show-stopper for this PR. I don't think we want to preserve this behavior.\r\n\r\nYes, advertising both addresses is something that can happen, but only in a few cases:\r\ne.g. if the address during version message processing is AddrV2-only, it is not sent out because we haven't gotten `sendaddrv2` yet. I think it might happen if we discovered a local IPv6 address and our peer sees us under a IPv4 address? \r\nI think that if this is something we really want, we could always advertise both (similar to your commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19843/commits/10fc62f0c29f640fdefc7114576133fbf18c488a) but I'm not sure it is necessary - after all, we have the [nScore](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f59e91511a3aa8b2770eeec7034ddc1a9dec918b/src/net.cpp#L245) logic to make an educated guess which address is better.\r\n\r\n>Another important difference could be the time between the two calls. This might make sense if there's a risk of someone inserting our self-ad (PushAddress) with the wrong metadata, eg nTime. Then our latter self-ad insertion would be dismissed (because we just look up the key), while the VERSION-one is protected from this issue.\r\nI don't think this is a show-stopper for this PR, although this surface could indeed be improved (e.g., handle duplicates better, or handle other-nodes-announce-us-through-us differently).\r\n\r\nI think I don't understand this completely, but the time between advertising during version message and `MaybeSendAddr` should usually be negligible, because `m_next_local_addr_send` is initialized to `0`, so `MaybeSendAddr` always advertises right after the version handshake is completed.\r\nAlso, we clear `m_addr_known` right before self-advertising in `MaybeSendAddr` ([code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f59e91511a3aa8b2770eeec7034ddc1a9dec918b/src/net_processing.cpp#L5086)) so it wouldn't be possible for an attacker to do something like preventing us from self-advertising by sending us our own address.  Is that what you meant?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I think there is no difference in when the advertisement would actually occur. the `ProcessMessage -> version` logic called `PushAddress` which (at best) adds the address to `m_addrs_to_send`. The actual constructing & sending of the message wouldn't occur until the `SendMessages` loop calls `MaybeSendAddr`.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMy understanding of this PR is that there would be no tangible behavioral differences in the cases where the `version` logic returned the same address as `MaybeSendAddr` logic. on master, if they result in two different addr, I believe we would advertise both. after this PR, we would only advertise the result of `GetLocalAddrForPeer`, which will select one of the two.\r\n\r\nSince the `version` logic always prioritized `GetLocalAddress` (aka what we think we are), the behavioral difference would occur in instances when `GetLocalAddrForPeer` (aka weighted guess) selects the result from `IsPeerAddrLocalGood` (aka what peer thinks we are). \r\n\r\nI think the only time this would cause a connectivity issue is if your peers are somehow reporting your address to be something that can't be connected to, and you would have advertised something usable with `GetLocalAddress`. I expect this to be quite rare, but additionally your self-identified address would eventually get out when `GetLocalAddrForPeer` selects the result of `GetLocalAddress`.\r\n\r\n> I think that if this is something we really want, we could always advertise both (similar to your commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/10fc62f0c29f640fdefc7114576133fbf18c488a) but I'm not sure it is necessary - after all, we have the [nScore](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f59e91511a3aa8b2770eeec7034ddc1a9dec918b/src/net.cpp#L245) logic to make an educated guess which address is better.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I stated above, I agree. Advertising both seems unnecessary, and the worst case should just be slower time for inbounds to connect to you?\r\n\r\n@mzumsande @naumenkogs curious to hear your feedback. do these claims track with your understanding?

It should be impossible for an attacker to make us relay a specific node in a targeted way to new nodes.\r\n",

Could this scenario be problematic?\r\n\r\nI think that it's not possible to say in general which address (the local or peer's one) is better, or \"correct\". In some cases, the peer may have a better idea how we are reachable than we do. In other cases, it's the other way round, or maybe neither  are working if we're just not reachable by others.\r\n\r\nAlso note that if we overrule our own local address and advertise with the address a peer sees us with, we'll only do that back to that same peer. We never send an `addrMe` address from one peer to other peers.\r\nTherefore, I think that peers can only influence the weight (`nScore`) between multiple local addresses (all of which we detected by ourselves at startup!) via `SeenLocal()` but never insert new ones that they pick - this should make it impossible to trick us into advertising an incorrect address to other peers.  If a peer is malicious, they can just discard the self-announcements we send them anyway, so it's not an attack if such a peer makes us advertise to them with a wrong address.\r\n\r\n> 2. even if we don't accept inbound connections, we still self-advertise. is it because we can't detect them?\r\n\r\nIf we explicitly disable inbound connections (`fListen == false`), we don't self-advertise, see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5488dc1eb47783259ba8557c5aaca312c3de0634/src/net_processing.cpp#L5159).\r\nBut yes, it is a very common situation (e.g. if we're behind a NAT, or the port for bitcoin is blocked by our firewall) that bitcoind isn't able to detect that we're actually unreachable - so self-advertisements happen in this case.",

We were not receiving any addr messages from the peer here, yet we initialized it. It seems like this was the case from the beginning.\r\n2. After this PR, calling `SetupAddressRelay` here seems unnecessary. If we drop it, the comment becomes valid :)\r\nAlthough the inconsistency is a good signal the comment is confusing, so perhaps we should drop it. Not very useful anyway, at least the current code is pretty readable.",
