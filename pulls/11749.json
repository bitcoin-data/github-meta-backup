Sounds reasonable?\r\n\r\nI don't have any strong feelings about the initialization fix (beyond the warm fuzzy feeling of seeing the number of static analyzer warnings decrease rather than increase over time), but I feel very strongly about getting the locking requirements annotated correctly :-)\r\n\r\nThat takes us to the important part discussed in this PR:\r\n\r\nThe comment …\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3c098a8aa0780009c11b66b1a5d488a928629ebf/src/wallet/wallet.h#L732-L734\r\n\r\n… suggested that `m_last_block_processed` is guarded by `cs_main`, so a corresponding Clang thread analysis annotation was added (in the annotations PR) …\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconst CBlockIndex* m_last_block_processed GUARDED_BY(cs_main);\r\n```\r\n\r\n… and hence the `LOCK(cs_main)` in `SetNull()` (as enforced by Clang's thread safety analysis).\r\n\r\nWhat is the correct locking annotation for `m_last_block_processed` – is it `GUARDED_BY(cs_main)` rather than `GUARDED_BY(cs_wallet)`?",
