I assume they are just not bothering to set a custom limit.\n\nThe problem is that if we are currently using 400kb, and the number of transactions continue to increase at the current rate, it won't be long before that number increases, and it's going to take a while for miners to get up to date so I feel it's better to increase it a bit now, while we wait for consesus around the 'hard' block size limit increase, or other viable solutions to scalability to come along.\n\nAlso worth noting that the data Luke has used removes 'Microtransactions' and transaction which Luke has classified as 'Inefficient/data use of the blockchain', but nevertheless are still occurring. \n",

I can't seem to find any discussion around moving it from 500KB to 750KB in ad898b40aaf06c1cc7ac12e953805720fc9217c0.\n\nIf we did move to a 20MB hard limit would you recommend increasing the soft limit to 15MB, leaving at 750KB or something else?\n",

Computing the average for the whole day, they get 20, so in order to optimize costs, they reduce their switching hardware capacity to 20 parallel phone calls. Does it make sense?\n\nObviously, no. If people will find that they can't use phone during the day, they will believe that quality of this company's service is extremely poor and phone is pretty much useless.\n\nThere is in fact  a branch of operations research called queueing theory which studies things like that, and can be used, among other things, to find optimal capacity. But who needs these complexities when you use **average**, the pinnacle of mathematical thought (according to Luke-jr)?\n",

Won't you leave it for an operator which has enough capacity to handle all phone calls during peak hours with no surcharges?\n\nNow imagine that before doing a call, you need to choose a tariff: business, premium, standard, economy. If there is an overload, economy users' calls will be dropped, then standard users and so on. Business tariff has highest priority. But also costs more, even when network is below its capacity. I'm sure you'd fucking love such a system.\n\nEven more so, calls aren't dropped, just delayed... So you might get connected 5 hours later.\n",

It is however a _fact_ that the current years-long behavior has been to bump this whenever pressure approaches.\n\nFirst we must care about users in the field who see behavior A (bump if pressure).\n\nSecond, we must be honest with our users that Bitcoin Core is changing to behavior B (fee pressure).\n\nIt is an utter failure of project management and an enormous disservice to users to suddenly stop merging changes like this _without communicating same to users_ .\n\nThe actual user experience, seen by users in the field, is that fees will go up.  Where is the blog post or release note informing users of the $3B economy of this change?\n\nSandbagging to achieve policy change is the single worst way to run a software project, regardless of the actual change in question.\n",

      "body": "@davout Yeah, sorry, I was only replying to Jeff's comment, not yours. Though that said bigger picture discussion is better off on the mailing list, and/or forums like reddit.\n\nRe: default blocksize, what should actually happen is it should be removed and replaced by a calculation that takes orphan risk into account. Basically, every transaction you add increases the chance of orphaning your block by some amount due to the larger size. If you know that marginal increase you can then keep a running tally of total block reward and stop adding transactions when marginal reward > marginal cost. As it turns out that constant can be calculated from the orphan rate and your own hash rate relatively easily, and orphan rate can be observed. (IIRC the constant basically has bytes/second as its units) There is the nuance that much of the hashing power has special peering setups that push orphan rate to near zero; your blocks don't necessarily get to participate in those peering setups. \n\nOf course, actually writing that patch and setting the default marginal orphan rate constant appropriately would be a great backdoor way of increasing the default max blocksize to 1MB. :)\n",

      "body": "@jgarzik That's just silly.  I can confirm that over 90% of the hashing power has changed the default blocksize - almost every single pool. Changing the default from 750KB to 1000KB when almost everyone is ignoring the defaults is an insignificant change that will have almost no effect. (<3% change to total capacity at best)\n\nWe're just maintainers of software implementing a protocol - we have little if any control over the implications of how that protocol is designed. The divergence is not something we control or can prevent as Bitcoin Core maintainers - it's a natural outcome of the Bitcoin protocol design that we have no direct control over.\n",

The more so a policy default that only applies to miners, not other full nodes. \n\nWhich is the entire reason that I closed the issue. \n\nAgain, lobby miners to increase the above option value. They can, and they are aware of it. There is no reason at all for this to be decision for Bitcoin Core development.  Everyone has their own responsibility in this decentralized network. Don't try to play it through me, I'm just here for bugs and issues related to the implementation.\n\n(and yes, the current default value was grandfathered in, not as a \"policy\" but as a working default value - maybe @luke-jr is right and these defaults should be removed completely, _forcing_ miners to set them. I've always pushed back against that because it makes upgrading for miners harder, and they are already a conservative bunch)\n",

      "body": "I agree with bitedgego - the default should either be 0 or max, anything between implies a policy recommendation from the core developers.\n\nIf miners wish to create a 'fee market' by reducing their own limits they are able to do so.\n\nI also agree that now that most of the miners appear to have changed from default (due to increased transactions and being 'called out' on it) this isn't really a significant change. However, there will still be some miners running the 750k default because they've not known or been bothered to change it, and accept it as the recommended setting.\n\n@maaku (and those that agree) - now that miners (90% of hash power according to @petertodd) have increased their limits past 750k, does your objection still stand?\n",
