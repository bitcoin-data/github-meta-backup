Even bringing up the topic of alt-coins otherwise is loudly discouraged... Yet here you're making dangerous changes to Bitcoin Core just so you'll save money on programmers.\n\nAs it is, it's not even clear _why_ your sidechain code would even benefit, and of course, that's currently non-opensource software that benefits no-one other than a secretive commercial company. You know, I personally am working on what you guys would call a sidechains implementation, and as I want to offer new functionality over Bitcoin it doesn't share any code at all with Bitcoin. Nor do I ask to have Bitcoin Core changed for the sake of my client's commercial venture.\n\nOf course, maybe I'm biased - I do spend almost all my time on Bitcoin Core reviewing, writing unit tests, and increasing code coverage rather than breaking things...\n",

Someone should really write that tool for \"identical-binary checking\" it will be very useful. \nAnyway, this seems a broader discussion that probably belongs to the mailing list. These changes are trivial (and thus not dangerous) and they're not changing consensus code but rather wallet and gui code.\nThe _why_ is rather simple too: move a little bit more towards type safety in amounts, a work that is not complete. It does benefit altcoins like freicoin saving it a couple of additional commits in the next rebase on top of bitcoin? Yes, so what?\nFreicoin's technical choice of maximizing the common codebase with Bitcoin benefits both projects by not fragmenting development unnecessarily. As an argument in favor of a change, benefiting codebases built on top of bitcoin may be a weak argument, but it should never be an argument against the change either.\n",

And readable, robust, auditable, transparent, and more flexible code is a benefit too.\n\nRegarding this pull request in particular: it continues a transformation of the code to abstract the handling of monetary amounts. IMHO, low benefit, but given that it's trivial and not touching consensus code, also low risk.\n\nRegarding changing the type of monetary amounts: that's an idea that started a long time ago (see #4067, #4234, #4614, #5117, and #5308), and has had plenty of discussion. I believe the bottom line was that changing the type would make things clearer, but a separate class wouldn't outweigh the risks. Do we need to have that discussion again? (I don't want to use the \"this was discussed before, we should never ever come back to it!\" argument, but it does seem very late to bring this up).\n\nRegarding motivations and conflict of interest: you can't ask more than people being honest about why they want a change.\n",

      "body": "I do plan to submit more changes related to CAmount but since a class was not wanted I am precisely trying to isolate the changes that could easily be accepted (as I thought these trivial changes would be).\nI believe these changes are beneficial for Bitcoin or I wouldn't propose them here. Other people might disagree and I have stepped back in the past (like not proposing a pow class anymore). About other people maintaining codebases on top of Bitcoin, I suggest them to propose their changes to Bitcoin if they think they would improve Bitcoin (by improving its modularity and type safety, for example).\nBut that has to be judged on a case by case basis, not on a person by person basis.\nThis is not proposing to turn CAmount into a class (which is something I would agree with but was rejected), and although it's moving towards the type safety that you would achieve doing so, it cannot be judged as the same thing.\nBut if one thinks that a change being convenient for altcoins or sidechains maintenance is irrelevant for its acceptance shouldn't be insisting so much on it as if it were a reason not to do it.\nI think it's a weak advantage for this codebase but still an advantage in itself. Many people disagree. Fair enough, I'll not use it as an argument. But it is very frustrating to hear \"this will benefit a dependent codebase\" as an argument against a change. \nIt would be also interesting to understand better what was so wrong about using a class instead of a typedef. I think many of the concerns had to do just with changing many different parts of the code at once. I'm precisely separating the changes to find out what will be accepted and what not. Maintaining this tiny patch independently won't be a huge pain if it turns out that people think it doesn't benefit bitcoin/master.\nSo the question is only \"does replacing if(CAmount) with if(CAmount != 0) make the code more unambiguous, type-safe and/or clear?\".\nMy answer is yes to all 3 but if this is so controversial I can leave that commit for other codebases, no problem.\n",

I went along with the CAmount change in the consensus code under the following conditions:\n- `CAmount` would be a typedef for `uint64_t`, not a class or anything more complex\n- The binary would be unchanged. I checked this. There is AFAIK no tool for this that I know of but an exact sequence of steps I published that can be used, so that's an easy 250mBTC for anyone that can do a search\n\nThis pull is simply a continuation of that into some silly GUI and wallet code, so I don't think it should be controversial.\n",
