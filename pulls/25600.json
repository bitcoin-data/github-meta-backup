    "body": "`mempoolfullrbf` allows a node to accept replace-by-fee transactions without requiring replaceability signaling. While the replacement transaction is locally accepted, it should be rejected by all your opt-in rbf peers, the default behavior. As such, the odds are low the replacement transaction propagates to miners, unless there are full-rbf transaction-relay paths existent between the node and those miners mempools.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve this issue by enabling the setting of full-rbf transaction-relay link, in both manual and automated fashions. \r\n\r\nThe first commit introduces a `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` service flag to advertise support of full-rbf to our peers if [`mempoolfullrbf`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25353) is set to true. From the results of `getpeerinfo` or `getnetworkinfo`, a node operator can find full-rbf peers on the p2p network to which to manually connect to. The service flag bit select is the 26th one to be compatible with previous full-rbf [experiences](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-June/020570.html).\r\n\r\nThe second commit introduces a `ConnectionType::FULLRBF` if `mempoolfullrbf` is set to true. In `ThreadOpenConnections`, we attempt to keep opened at least 4 outbound full-rbf transaction-relay peer. An outbound full-rbf relay peer is considered as one signaling `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` service flag.\r\n\r\nI think if we have concerns on the network-wise resources consumption from those new outbound full-rbf relay peers, we could deduce them `MAX_ADNNODE_CONNECTIONS`. It should be weighted if we have other concerns about the implications on transaction-relay topology robustness or any spying peers flagging themselves as `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` to attract early full-rbf traffic. What else ?\r\n\r\nI don't hold to the approach re-using the current automatic connection logic in `ThreadOpenConnections`, if there are others ones I'm interested to consider them. I can split the PR in two, if automatic connection requires more thinking.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- add functional tests\r\n- make `MAX_FULLRBF_RELAY_CONNECTIONS` configurable up to `MAX_ADDNODE_CONNECTIONS` ?\r\n- make automatic connection its own boolean setting ?",

See  https://github.com/mzumsande/fullrbf_simulation for the code.\r\n- This PR would lower the threshold of `p` drastically close to zero, so that merging it would be a strong statement that we want full-rbf to be possible, even if it's just a small minority of nodes that support it. On the other hand, it adds additional complexity to the networking code, and I'm not sure if making p2p peering decisions base on policy is something we'd want in general.\r\nBut if adding support for automatic preferential peering is such a strong statement anyway - why don't we just change the default of `mempoolfullrbf` to `true` instead and save us all the added complexity?\r\n- Finally, just mentioning the possibility of false signaling. If other nodes want to prevent or delay full-rbf they could signal full-rbf but not implement it. I'm not sure if we can detect or punish them for that.",

I don't think it is required, requesting LN users and some miners to use full RBF would be enough.\r\n\r\nWell that's a fundamental trade-off between signaling policy to ease peering and retaining information. I think the relevant question is this _additional_ information allow or significantly ease a concrete attack against node operator or funds safety. That said, even if the attack is qualified, the risk could be bearable by the operator, if the documentation is clear in that sense. E.g, in LN we recently specified out [zero-conf channels](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/910), they're coming with a lot of safety tradeoffs, though they're a UX improvement for sure.\r\n\r\n> Writing 'help' if lost on an island could result in 2 things:\r\n>    An aircraft or chopper notices and helps you\r\n>    Someone else finds you alone, looking for help, tries to exploit and kill you\r\n\r\nBeware life is risky :)\r\n\r\n> This is a good point which I did not consider earlier though I am not sure about announcing replacement transactions only to those peers.\r\n\r\nIn case of uncertain privacy/security risks, security-by-compartmentalization.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr \r\n\r\n> Edit: Or just mark it as a temporary service bit like existing usage does\r\n\r\nWell, I used the same experimental bit 26 than the patchset from @petertodd.

      "body": "@mzumsande\r\n\r\nFor more perspective, I would like to recall that seeing full-rbf more deployed on the p2p network makes multi-party funded transactions more robust, at the price of zero-conf transactions accepting services more vulnerable to double-spend attacks. I think it raises an interesting question, in the sense of how as the Bitcoin Core project we should weight for a policy A or policy B offering different set of impacts on Bitcoin applications. In my opinion, the discussions can be tie-breaked on the hard physics of the system and recognizing there is no such thing as a global mempool in a distributed system therefore making assumptions on transactions ordering is inherently unsafe.\r\n\r\nAll of that to say I would like not to adopt a game theory reasoning framework, as ultimately game theory, at least zero-sum games, relies on the assumption of moves triggered by set of players in the pursuit of a gain, at the detriment of the other subsets. I'm thinking more of this change as a \"organic\" policy release engineering practice, namely giving the tools to the node operators to progressively activate full-rbf and build the full-rbf supporting routes. Even if we can assume a active subset of node operators quickly picking up the changes, social inertia being it won't happen overnight. This should give time for zero-conf transactions accepting services to either deprecate this mode of payment or moving to safe instant payments like LN or deploy (non-perfect) distributed mempools monitoring system.\r\n\r\nHowever, I acknowledge this is an ideal policy release practice, and adding automatic preferential peering might be too much a strong statement, or the timing is too short (let's give another buffer release before to introduce automatic preferential peering ?), or we should give more time to express technical dissent from zero-conf services providers or anyone else. Posting on the mailing list was done on this purpose.\r\n\r\nBeyond, I think this discussion is still interesting even in the lack of policy reversal like with full-rbf when we deploy new transaction-relay policy changes (e.g Erlay, package-relay, new RBF rules), we might firewall the new policy changes behind settings to observe first the performance, privacy-preserving or robustness properties of new features. We could clean up the added code complexity when we estimate the feature as mature.\r\n\r\nI think it's interesting to have a robust connectivity model of the p2p network, with factors like percentage `p` of nodes that need to support the new features and the chance threshold for success. I think we would enrich such model with the set of mempools miners among the let's say 10k listening peers (maybe Stratum v2 might change some assumptions ?). About false signaling, I think we might reduce it to buggy signaling and includes some factor `f`. I believe a mitigation against false signaling could be to run a scrapper testing the effectiveness of full-rbf and noting the peers address, however the dissemination of such information of \"misbehaving\" peers if relied on centralized/semi-centralized sources like DNS seeds is more likely to be more harmful than beneficial.",

As @mzumsande notes, you need a significant % of nodes supporting full-RBF propagation before txs propagate reliably; once the [percolation threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory) is reached propagation suddenly becomes quite reliable. Also, as per my review, connecting to a single full-RBF peer is insufficient to achieve good propagation.",

      "body": "FYI I tried setting `MAX_FULLRBF_RELAY_CONNECTIONS = 4` on three of my nodes, and if that's all you do they don't reliably connect to more than one full-rbf node no matter how long the node runs, even though there are a bunch of them on the network. Secondly, as I expected, transactions don't reliably propagate between full-RBF nodes with just one full-RBF peer.\r\n\r\nPutting the `conn_type` if clause higher up in precedence does fix this problem; right now connecting to full-rbf peers has lower precedence than feeler connections.",

One is to argue that releasing a full-rbf service bit and corresponding automatic preferential peering is a strong statement in the wide deployment of full-rbf and a more neutral position should be adopted by the project, at least for now. Another one would be shortcut the added complexity and go directly to turn on fullrbf by default. A last viewpoint would be to release only the p2p tools for a node operator to opt and enforce the replacement policy adequate for its application, without aiming for coordinated deployment network-wide.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm still favoring the latest viewpoint, as in light of a more complex ecosystem, I think we should aim for gradual deployment of new policy rules, not only to experiment the robustness/privacy/performance of the changes themselves but also to enable gradual adaptions of the node operators and Bitcoin services. I think stability and previsibility of our p2p and policy rules matter.",

It just allows those nodes which chose this policy to do better peering.\r\n\r\n>Another one would be shortcut the added complexity and go directly to turn on fullrbf by default.\r\n\r\nThis is a hard part for me. The opponents of `fullrbf` have expectations about their zero-conf transactions. This would destroy them right away I guess. But so does this PR, if it succeeds to achieve its goals? And my expectation is that this is just a matter of time. In practice, their expectations could be destroyed even by interested parties (LN, etc.) connecting to miners directly (assuming they run `fullrbf`).\r\nSo it seems like the main question of this alternative is how it looks politically, even though opt-in will go away one way or another.\r\n\r\n>to release only the p2p tools for a node operator to opt and enforce the replacement policy adequate for its application, without aiming for coordinated deployment network-wide.\r\n\r\n1. I don't think it really saves us much code complexity (diff is minimal).\r\n2. Politically, if this PR approach saves us some bikeshedding, sure.\r\n3. Do I miss anything?",

      "body": "@luke-jr\r\n\r\n> This doesn't make sense. The current de facto \"position\" is anti-RBF. Making it an option disabled by default is the very minimum to be neutral.\r\n\r\nIn a decentralized ecosystem environment like Bitcoin, I think the measurement of stakeholders positions about consensus or policy rules changes should rely on a wide (non-exhaustive) variety of factors: compatible softwares, reasoned opinions on technical trade-offs, economic actors adoptions, enabled use-cases, etc. The weight attached to each of this factor to determine ecosystem position or consensus is left to everyone's appreciation. Therefore your statement about anti-RBF being the de facto \"position\" is the reflect of your personal judgement and I don't believe it should be interpreted as the ecosystem position. Other developers, entities and node operators might have a diverging appreciation than yours. At the very least in the LN community only, the advantages of full-rbf sound to be well-understood and appreciated. In my opinion, this data point would make it hard to qualify there is a solidified anti-RBF sentiment across the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n> This isn't a new rule to the network, just Core. Knots and other software have supported it for years.\r\n\r\nThe interest of this work is not only to offer the tools to node operators to profit from full-rbf propagation paths at their own choice, but also to interrogate how the project is deploying new changes across the ecosystem, in light of the increasing complexity of Bitcoin applications (lightning, coinjoins, swaps, etc) with significant stakes. In that regard, while I agree that full-rbf isn't a new rule, the \"new\" qualification was aiming to encompass future p2p/mempool policy changes like package relay or ephemeral output, still at the design stage and not yet fully-implemented in any other Bitcoin software to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\n> Policy is primarily a per-node matter, not really a per-software matter.\r\n\r\nWhile I acknowledge the subjective ability of node operator to use, copy, study and change their Bitcoin softwares in any way suiting their preferences, as contributors to this project we're still left with the question on what default which should pickup among a set of policy options. The choice of a default might be far from neutral in term of privacy, economic efficiency, safety or any other dimensions that matters. Moreover, as the RBF signaling case is illustrating, a default choice might impact negatively a use-case (here zero-conf) while offering positive impact on another use-case (here multi-party funding transactions). I think we should build gradually over time a common decision-making framework in how Bitcoin Core adopts a default policy rule, that way guaranteeing stability and previsibility to our users.\r\n\r\n@petertodd\r\n\r\n> To be clear, we always have a gradual deployment because adoption of new Bitcoin Core releases is always a gradual process. Just enabling full-rbf by default would be a gradual deployment from that point of view.\r\n\r\nYes, I agree we always had a gradual deployment because adoption of new Bitcoin Core versions isn't uniform and instantaneous across the ecosystem. While enabling full-rbf by default would still be a gradual deployment from that viewpoint, the position of offering service bit and automatic preferential peering would allow the \"market\" of node operator to suit what is best for their use-cases, without Bitcoin Core, the project have to adopt a strong position on this policy rule. In case of controversial policy rules, the best we might be able to do is document clearly the trade-offs presented by every policy rule options.\r\n\r\n> On the other hand, if you're talking about gradual deployment in the sense of new transaction types getting to miners, we always have a non gradual deployment if preferential peering is not used. Because the math behind percolation means that there is a sharp transition between \"not enough nodes to reliably propagate\" and \"enough nodes to reliably propagate\"\r\n\r\nIn that regard, hopefully we could do a better knowledge transmission work towards the ecosytem node operators to explain that percolation theory being what it is, we're left with a binary situation w.r.t to deployment of new transaction types getting to miners. I think this is opening an interesting question, as some choice and deployment of policy rules might offer security properties emerging from holistic behaviors. E.g, if a LN node security and safety funds is increased with the deployment of package relay, one could argue with the number of full-nodes supporting and enabling that change across the ecosystem, the security is in proportion increased, in a quantitative fashion.\r\n\r\n@naumenkogs\r\n\r\n> This is a hard part for me. The opponents of fullrbf have expectations about their zero-conf transactions. This would destroy them right away I guess. But so does this PR, if it succeeds to achieve its goals? And my expectation is that this is just a matter of time. In practice, their expectations could be destroyed even by interested parties (LN, etc.) connecting to miners directly (assuming they run fullrbf).\r\nSo it seems like the main question of this alternative is how it looks politically, even though opt-in will go away one way or another.\r\n\r\nAbout the \"zero-conf transactions\" security, while I think this assumption has always been weak due to the distributed nature of the Bitcoin p2p network and practical \"zero-conf\" double-spend have been demonstrated in the past, enabling full-rbf by default is lowering the technical and knowledge bar to enact such double-spend. This \"zero-conf\" attacks lowering bar could be gauged as an encroachment on some operators applications or services interests. At the really same time, we have [demonstrated DoS](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-July/020737.html) against the reliability of multi-party funded transactions due to opt-in RBF. In that \"split\" situation regarding policy change, I would say the best we might be able to do as a project is to offer tools to the market of node operators, to let them express there is demand for fullrbf (even if due to percolation theory, the operators threshold to disaggregate the \"zero-conf\" security notion is low).\r\n\r\nZooming out, I think there is a concern of us establishing stable policy release engineering practices, and setting a good precedent towards the community, in anticipation of more complex \"Bitcoin-applications-and-policy-rules-interactions\" cases in the future.\r\n\r\n@instagibbs\r\n\r\n> If it's universally rejected by users and miners, then it's a no-op. If it has significant uptake, we can revisit ripping out the additional complexity in follow-on release.\r\n\r\nI'm converging on that, we shouldn't substitute in the users and miners roles about expressing demand for full-rbf. While we might still do a knowledge transmission work in explaining the trade-offs, we might miss subtle trade-offs due to lack of informations on their use-cases. If there is a significant uptake, for sure we can rip out the additional complexity in follow-on releases.",

      "body": "There was a number of relevant discussions about this PR during yesterday review club session: https://bitcoincore.reviews/25600\r\n\r\nThe increased resource (inbound/outbound slots) usage of the new 4 outbound-full-rbf peers was raised as a concern. However, as this is the automatic preferential peering is only enable if the node operator turns `mempoolfullrbf=1`, and as such opt-in for the resource consumption this could be acceptable (at the condition there is proper disconnection when the service bit doesn't match between addr and version).\r\n\r\nThe non-reliability of the service execution as advertised by the service bit, in the present case full-rbf acceptance of a non-signaling replacement transaction, has been raised as another concern. A peer can never be \"trusted\" to relay transactions or accomplish the p2p request sent to.\r\n\r\nThe rational of introducing automatic preferential peering instead of turning on by default `mempoolfullrbf` has been discussed. On one side, there is a code complexity increased to support peering. on the other hand we have no certainty that this policy default would be the best trade-off for all the applications relying on Bitcoin Core for their operations, especially as this change could have safety impact. Delegating the default setting to node operators could also set a good precedent in the way policy are released, by removing uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThere is also simulations for the number of nodes required to enable `mempoolfullrbf` for the propagation paths to be effective: https://github.com/mzumsande/fullrbf_simulation",

As long as our peer selection strategy is robust, I think we should be able to discover the most-work valid chain and have our transactions relayed to the miners.\r\n\r\nApart of the peer selection strategy, we could implement more invading logic to monitor the quality of our peers, in analogy on how LN is selecting routing hops to build payment path over which to relay HTLC. However, this would raise a number of other trade-offs, especially in term of network-wise resource consumption and privacy, and I'm not sure it's a relevant direction.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, a service bit, I think save a lot of time to full-rbf node operators and should increase efficiency of full-rbf transaction propagation, under the assumption that at least one of our full-rbf peers selected by our connection logic is honest.\r\n\r\nThat said, if we can come up with an efficient solution to service bit spoofing attack, that could be interesting to think about implementing it.",

      "body": "@jonatack\r\n\r\n> I agree.\r\n\r\nThanks for the review, note the proposal of introducing automatic preferential peering with a limited number of full-rbf signaling peers is a procedural novation itself in the way we release policy change, imo. Rather than turning on by default `mempoolfullrbf`, and therefore ignoring the implications on Bitcoin applications/services arguing \"zero-conf\" security or any advantage from optin-rbf, we give the transaction-relay tooling for the node operators seeking to benefit from full-rbf. While acknowledging that due to percolation theory, the equilibrium is unstable, we as a project remove the necessity in our decision-making to have to arbiter between class of applications. I think by setting this precedent we make the project decision-making process in matters of policy with holistic implications on the ecosystem more lisible and predictable for our users. I'm concerned in the future of more complex future policy changes affecting the safety or security of L2 applications, due to design undersight from our side.\r\n\r\n@1440000bytes \r\n\r\n>    You can ban peers that are using full RBF\r\n>    You can false signal that your node is using full RBF\r\n\r\nIn the former case, it's unclear to me what exact interest of a honest node is damaged by a malicious peer refusing connection, as another more valuable peer will be sought. In the latter case, while it sounds correct to me you will waste an outbound slot of a honest node, this can be already achieved for any regular connection. I don't think we're making strong assumptions of peer reliability in our p2p stack, therefore the redundancy of connections. As laid out by other contributors, as long as there is 1 honest full-rbf peers, there is already a full-rbf propagation efficiency gain. ",

      "body": "> Thanks for the review, note the proposal of introducing automatic preferential peering with a limited number of full-rbf signaling peers is a procedural novation itself in the way we release policy change, imo. Rather than turning on by default mempoolfullrbf, and therefore ignoring the implications on Bitcoin applications/services arguing \"zero-conf\" security or any advantage from optin-rbf, we give the transaction-relay tooling for the node operators seeking to benefit from full-rbf. While acknowledging that due to percolation theory, the equilibrium is unstable, we as a project remove the necessity in our decision-making to have to arbiter between class of applications. I think by setting this precedent we make the project decision-making process in matters of policy with holistic implications on the ecosystem more lisible and predictable for our users. I'm concerned in the future of more complex future policy changes affecting the safety or security of L2 applications, due to design undersight from our side..\r\n\r\n@ariard I am surprised someone who guided me with lot of RBF attacks and CVE-2022-35913 wants to go ahead with this. There are some some issue which I don't want to repeat and been mentioned in the pull request. We can get our head in the sand and go ahead merging this because we cannot read anything negative from new contributors. \r\n\r\nI would keep testing this after merging and please don't blame me if there are any CVE in any bitcoin projects.\r\n\r\n",

It sounds really artificial for us to constraint node operators in their peers topology when there is a deliberate choice to deviate from the spontaneous topology generated by `ThreadOpenConnections`.\r\n\r\nThat said, this approach of enforcing connection limits controls on the types of connection is already what is implemented by `AddConnection`, not subjecting outbound full-rbf peers to limits control would deviate from that behavior. So I think the real discussion we should have would be about if those checks make really sense in `ThreadOpenConnections`. Though as it's a point preceding this PR, I would leave as it is.\r\n\r\nBeyond, I wonder if that really matters as `addconnection` is regtest-only (cf. L347, in `src/rpc/net.cpp`).",

      "body": "I think the chances to be connected to a full-rbf subgraph by relying only on the 8 automatic outgoing connections sounds really low, even assuming you're a listening node. If you model something with ~60k nodes, ~125 connection slots and 100 full-rbf nodes across the network, the success probability is like what ~1/60 ? This could explain the observed lack of RBF-advertising peers connections.\r\n\r\nThinking back to the model laid out above, rather to define success as the existence of a full-rbf route between two full-rbf supporting nodes another success definition could be the propagation of a full-rbf tx among the quasi-unanimity of the full-rbf peers. Therefore to achieve success we should aim to eradicate disconnected graphs of full-rbf peers. The exact value of `MAX_FULLRBF_RELAY_CONNECTIONS` would be function of the set size of peers we assume enabling full-rbf by option.\r\n\r\nI think the concern about increased consumption of inbound capacity is qualified, however I would say best we can do is giving us a slot budget. I.e assuming a set size of full-rbf peers, a number of new automatic outbound connections and an occupation rate of the inbound slots of the listening peers and gauge if the result is acceptable. ",

Since we're doing preferential peering, the total number of peers with full-rbf on the network isn't relevant. We simply need a figure high enough that a sufficient number of full-rbf-signalling peers we connect to are in fact, actuall full-rbf peers that likewise have preferential peering. Second, by \"sufficient number\", we need something greater than 1 so we end up with a well-connected group rather than disconnected chains. 4+ should be fine.\r\n\r\nSo the actual figure we care about is what % of peers with the full-rbf service bit set are running this code (or something like it)? There are a handful of nodes running Knots that advertise the service bit but don't do preferential peering. Once a reasonable number of people (a few dozen) use this flag, they probably won't matter as AFAICT there's less than half a dozen such Knots-running nodes.",

Second, by \"sufficient number\", we need something greater than 1 so we end up with a well-connected group rather than disconnected chains. 4+ should be fine.\r\n\r\nYes, I think it would be interesting to have a consistent propagation model to determine what exact \"sufficient number\" would fit to ensure we have well-connected full-rbf group rather than disconnected chains. I wonder if there have been such models established in the past Core discussions about p2p modifications or extensions. Otherwise landing on the number 4+ sounds really found by empiricism and historical observations ? (not a bad method we should just be aware of the limits) ",
