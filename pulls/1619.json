    "body": "This patch set imports the Google LevelDB 1.5 database, refactors the transaction database code a little and then lets you pick between LevelDB or BDB via a build flag (qmake USE_LEVELDB=- to go back).\n\nOn test machines, LevelDB seems to be significantly faster than BDB due to the fact that the bulk of the IO work is handled by a separate thread. The main thread just appends data to the end of a log file when writing, and the IO thread then turns logs into sorted tables and compacts them together.\n\nWhen indexing the block chain Bitcoin appears to be CPU bound on Windows and Linux machines, even during migration when signature checking is disabled. On my SSD based MacBook Pro the performance isn't as good and it still seems to be IO bottlenecked, which is the opposite of what I'd expect.\n\nThis code instructs LevelDB to use a 10-bit bloom filter per block. This expands the size of the database quite a bit, but allows a reduction in disk seeks. I haven't tested different bloom filter sizes to see what works better. It is an area for future work.\n\nLevelDB is statically included because:\n- Upstream is not widely packaged and the build system does not support \"make install\", so it's annoying to link against\n- We need custom patches to make it work on Windows.\n- It's important that all Bitcoin users are running on a db engine tested by us. We don't want some fraction of the network nodes to be \"upgraded\" but still running on BDB just because of who built their binaries.\n",

LevelDB runs in Chromium (`env_chromium.cc`) on Windows and is heavily tested there, but of course those APIs are Chrome specific. For Mac, Linux etc. it comes with an `env_posix.cc`. For Windows, Edouard wrote an `env_boost.cc`. All I did then was to make the MSVC specific stuff MingW compatible. ([diff](https://github.com/justmoon/leveldb-mingw/commit/81b85db8bf6dde62d80ae5bed33a29ade27129fc))\n\n@mikehearn: Let me know if/how we should go about promoting this upstream. We'd probably have the best chances once we also test native compilation on Windows with both GCC and MSVC - which is on my todo list.\n\n> Dynamic linking to OS-provided LevelDB should be supported, especially since the fork is only needed for Win32\n\nI agree, there are many bad, but also a few good reasons why people might want to link to their own LevelDB build, so there should be a clean, canonical way of doing it without having to edit build files.\n",

      "body": "I'll wait for Gavin to give his opinion on this before doing any work.\n\nHonestly, I don't care about trying to get the Windows support into upstream. The authors/maintainers of LevelDB are some of the most senior engineers at Google. They are, to put it mildly, very busy. Nor do they particularly care about making LevelDB useful outside the Chrome context. As forks go, this one is likely to not be much of a hassle, but upstreaming the Windows/MinGW support likely is.\n\nI also don't see any benefit in depending on some other git repository via gitian, or making it easy for people to link against a dynamic libleveldb. There aren't any reasons why you'd have leveldb on your system. If somebody wants to modify the leveldb code, they could just as easily patch the version in the source tree.\n\nI think the whole libraries/dynamic/static/forking thing is a distraction. LevelDB is just code. There are no reasons you'd want to have it split out from the main codebase. Nobody should be upgrading the version of LevelDB Bitcoin uses unless they have a good understanding of both codebases, it's definitely not something that should just be randomly pulled in via an apt-get upgrade.\n",

      "body": "> So should this compile fine on Windows with MinGW and the default Qt SDK GCC (which is currently still 4.4) as it is? \n\nLevelDB's build system uses a shell script (`build_detect_platform`) to create a `build_config.mk` file. To build natively on Windows, we would need some other way to generate that file. Other than that, the code should work with MSVC and MingW-GCC - though I haven't tested it yet, so there may a few minor issues to fix.\n\n> Just interested, how much longer takes a compilation with this patch?\n\nOn my Ubuntu system, Bitcoin-Qt takes 312.8s to compile (which doesn't change significantly with this patch) and LevelDB takes 13.5s to compile. So the overall increase of the compile time is about 4-5% for me.\n\nNote that LevelDB is not currently included in a `make clean`, so you don't rebuild it very often. Maybe it should be though?\n",

      "body": "@mikehearn The reason I'm pushing ultraprune is exactly because of the performance improvements. If I disable signature checking, importing the entire blockchain (using -loadblock, a few weeks ago) took 7 minutes on my laptop (6 minutes when on tmpfs instead of disk, 5 minutes when I use an std::map-backed store instead of BDB). It was originally intended to reduce storage requirements and permit pruning, but because of the much smaller working set, there is a very significant speedup. Pruning isn't even implemented right now (but would be trivial), and I need a bit more time to do tests to verify that it works exactly as the current validation engine, but apart from that, it is mostly functional. I hope to have a pull request soon.\n",

If upstream doesn't change then having it be a separate library doesn't achieve much.\n\nThe patch we're using wouldn't be accepted upstream, I already asked.

      "body": "> Is there a technical reason why straight Win32 API cannot be used? I looked through env_boost.cc and port_win.cc, and it seems like a doable task.\n\nYes it is doable as evidenced by the fact that it has been done:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/leveldbwin/source/browse/trunk/leveldb/util/env_win32.cc?r=3\n\nThis file is woefully out of date I'm afraid. But it should allow even somebody with very lacking Win32 API skills to complete this project in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nSince I want a Windows port of LevelDB for the Windows version of BitcoinJS and since we do _not_ have a dependency on Boost, I shall have a go at it.\n",

It makes the qmake file (at least) pretty ugly. Is it possible to include the .cc files that we need in the build project like we do with spirit-json? I'm not sure this is a good idea either but I agree with @luke-jr that the current \"nested build\" setup is pretty ugly\n",
