That should be the most authoritative information about the connection.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately I don't think this is true: \r\n>  but if we accidentally forget to create the necessary data structures, test will fail; \r\n\r\nI updated `RelayAddrsWithConn` to always return true, recompiled & ran `test_runner.py` & unit tests. Nothing failed. My concern would be addressed if it did :) I think with #19315, we should be able to add functional tests that would fail if a discrepancy occurs? \r\n\r\nCurrently I think the downside is probably acceptable, but want to highlight since I don't think we have any automatic protection in place. (unless I'm missing something?) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@jnewbery, RE: \r\n> I think it'd be good to extract everything in the while (!interruptNet) in ThreadOpenConnections() into its own function since deeply nested while/for/if blocks obscure control flow and are very often the sources of bugs. Doing that might be scope creep for this PR though.\r\n\r\nI 100% agree. I spent *so* many hours trying to interpret the exact logic around what types of connections are open, and have gotten very confused by the deeply nested logic flows & nuances of things like where a break / continue that's 4 levels deep will pop you back out to. I've taken a first pass at extracting the outer `while (!interruptNet)` loop here (yes, there are two levels nested): https://github.com/amitiuttarwar/bitcoin/commit/eecc5877c08744c55200846bb7b3b70c922b75ec. However, it needs to be done with great care and I would need to spend a lot more time / build a lot more confidence with these changes before I'd feel comfortable proposing them. Feel free to take a look or further the branch if you're interested :) ",

They were getting pretty web-like, so I've tried my best to resolve and focus on any outstanding conversations. \r\n\r\n\r\n>> It looks like all of the remaining review comments are on style/documentation. Perhaps we should aim to merge this and address those in a follow-up?\r\n\r\n> Most of the changes in this commit are style/documentation. It's not like it's a big logic-changing PR with a lot of ACKs will have to invalidate :)\r\n\r\nI'd like to get this PR merged sooner rather than later for a couple reasons: \r\n* I’d like to get the renames on master to avoid possibility of more silent merge conflicts\r\n* there are now two PRs that build on this (#19858 & #19860). further improvements can be addressed in parallel rather than holding up the whole sequence. \r\n* I think its important not to discourage review / lose momentum. @jnewbery has ACKed the tip twice already & I’ve had to invalidate because of needing rebase. with 10 commits deep, it doesn't seem trivial to reACK, so I'd rather use that review energy on smaller isolated changes that can be handled in another PR.\r\n\r\njust trying to express that if I do get ACKs, I'm going to try to be cautious about invalidating, so might opt for starting another branch/PR if more non-essential changes are requested.

That moves the address from the new table to the tried table, and updates the `nLastSuccess`/`nLastTry`/`nAttempts` fields. We only do this if the peer isn't inbound and isn't block-relay-only. I don't believe this change can easily be detected by a peer sending us `getaddr` messages.\r\n2. if a peer self-advertises to us, we'll call `AddAddressKnown()`, which could update the `nTime`, which is included in the address record that we send to a peer in response to a `getaddr` request.\r\n3. when we disconnect from the peer, we'll update the `nTime`, as long as the peer was marked as `fCurrentlyConnected`. That happens when we receive a `verack` from a peer which is not inbound. This doesn't include feeler peers, since we disconnect from them as soon as we receive a `version` message from them. The `nTime` is only updated during disconnection so spies can't find out who we're currently connected to (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5860#issuecomment-78397140).\r\n\r\nIn summary, I think block-relay-only peers _should_ have their address marked good when we connect to them (1). If we don't, then we'll update the `nLastTry` and `nAttempts` fields when we attempt to connect to them, but not update the `nLastSuccess`.\r\n\r\nThe reason it's important in this PR is that placing `MarkAddressGood()` behind a conditional `if (AdvertiseAddressToConn())` is very confusing for anyone reading the code, and makes it easy to introduce subtle bugs.",

I think comment \"Note that block-relay-only peers are already implicitly protected so we only consider setting m_protect for the full-relay peers\" is wrong as block-relay-only peers seems to not be protected from eviction by lagging chain logic and as such we should modify this check to scope them in setting `m_protect==true` (or either modify `ConsiderEviction`'s first check)\r\n\r\n\r\nAFAICT, we have 2 different logics to evict outbound peers : lagging-chain (`ConsiderEviction`) and (`CheckForStaleTipAndEvictPeers`). The former to sanitize out lazy/buggy peers who have never sent us a valid header and are always staying behind our tip, the latter triggered in case of stale tip due to block variance to seek a better chain by rotating our outbound peers if we already reach an outbound limit (`EvictExtraOutboundPeers`).\r\n\r\nWith regards to stale-tip, outbound block-relay-only are protected based on `m_tx_relay==nullptr` : https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/197450f80868fe752c6107955e5da80704212b34/src/net_processing.cpp#L3977\r\n\r\nWith regards to lagging-chain, outbound block-relay-only are protected based on  `m_protect==true` :\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/197450f80868fe752c6107955e5da80704212b34/src/net_processing.cpp#L3909\r\n\r\nSo we may evict them if due to block variance they fulfilled the lagging chain conditions, contrary to the intent of unconditionally conserve them once they announced to us a header.",

To answer `getaddr` we fetch randomly a list of address from both `vvNew/vvTried` without record bias as far as a quick read of `CAddrMan::GetAddr_` let it think. So moving address from a table to another doesn't change the ability of an attacker to learn about a block-relay-only address.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could improve block-relay-only peers unobservability in future works around AddrMan by filtering out `block-relay-only` address from `getaddr` replies, without introducing an oracle for the original sender of the used address ? @naumenkogs ",

      "body": "My instinct is that it'd be best if the addrman were completely unchanged as a result of block-relay connections, at least while we are connected to the peer. So if there are places where block-relay connections cause some kind of update in addrman, then those should be bugs that we fix.\r\n\r\nHere's my thinking:\r\n(a) it's not clear to me that there's not some way to sniff out things in the tried table from things in the new table. For instance, I think the new table tends to be much bigger than the tried table, yet I think when we respond to getaddr requests, we sample 50% from the tried table and 50% from the new table.  This creates a bias that, if you had the ability to read someone's addrman, might leak information about who someone might be connected to.\r\n\r\n(b) Even if we have limited the ability to read someone's addrman today (eg with fixes like #18991), I think it's helpful to separate the policies around addrman from being too tightly interwoven into other features like block-relay peers.  The easiest way to reason about this stuff is to say that block-relay peers have no effect on addrman, and then we know that any changes in addrman / addr relay can't possibly leak information about our block-relay peers.\r\n\r\nThe only potential hesitation I have advancing this point of view is if there are side effects from not updating addrman that might be detrimental.  For instance, it does seem like it would be terrible if an existing block-relay peer that we are successfully peered with for some time could be evicted from the addrman altogether, and then we forget about it.  But maybe it's enough to either update addrman at the time of disconnection, or save the peer as is suggested in #17428?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, this discussion over the best behavior for the interaction between block-relay peers and addrman deserves its own issue.  I do agree with the current version of the proposed code which checks for the peer being a block-relay peer.",

Opening\r\n        // OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY connections gets the highest priority until we\r\n        // meet our full-relay capacity. Then we open BLOCK_RELAY connection\r\n        // until we hit our block-relay-only peer limit.\r\n        // GetTryNewOutboundPeer() gets set when a stale tip is detected, so we\r\n        // try opening an additional OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY connection. If none of\r\n        // these conditions are met, check the nNextFeeler timer to decide if\r\n        // we should open a FEELER.\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I believe that is the right place for documenting the order. I realized that the block-relay-only enum comment mentioned ordering so I've gone ahead and removed that. I think these comments are most valuable if they focus on the design goals and the high level description of the connection type & we look at the relevant code for more specifics. otherwise we also risk the comments falling out of date. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Actually it does also solve bucket conflict between 2 tried tables entries, see : #9037\r\n\r\nwhat is this in response to? is there a suggested change?

So I think this is right, and while we could split this block into two parts, one gated on whether the peer has the addr-relay data structures, and another gated on whether the peers is an outbound block-relay only connection, that seems pretty unnecessary to me.  If someone adds another connection type that is outbound and non-block-relay only and only needs part of this, it can be refactored then.",
