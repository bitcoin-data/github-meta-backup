I don't think changing `GetSizeOfCompactSize` and `WriteCompactSize` would be enough?\r\n\r\nFWIW I think the platform requirements are reasonable. My goal with this PR is just making the platform requirements explicit and immediately obvious to compilers, humans and static analysers :-)\r\n\r\nI think a compile time check is the most elegant and non-intrusive way to achieve that goal.",
