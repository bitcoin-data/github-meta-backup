Another benefit might be that if there was a guideline requiring asserts before pointer dereferences, it might encourage more uses of c++ references instead of pointers, which I think would be good.\r\n\r\nWill add my code utACK 75f360cfd8e69656bebe195e64b4ad1b1b069ae6 if other people want this change, but personally would like it better if the change was dropped or accompanied by a developer guideline.",
