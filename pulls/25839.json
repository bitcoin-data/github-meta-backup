However, the role does include permissions on the\n+repository, and connotes a general sense of stewardship over the project.\n+\n+\n+Largely, the role of maintainers is to decide to merge Pull Requests.\n+\n+Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+maintainers.\n+\n+Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+principles of the project, meets the minimum standards for inclusion, and will\n+judge the general consensus of contributors. The review process that\n+establishes general consensus is detailed in\n+[CONTRIBUTING.mg](/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, one Bitcoin's maintainers was a designated \"Lead Maintainer\",\n+which was most recently @laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the unofficial\n+title of Lead Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a\n+bug-not-feature if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over\n+other General Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+There is no prohibition or process that differentiates self-merges from normal\n+merges.\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added by a new maintainer opening a pull-request to add their\n+key to the Trusted Keys file. For example, see [this pull\n+request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798). The adding of the key\n+is reviewed by the community and merged at the discretion of the existing\n+maintainers. Before opening such a pull request, it is typical that the adding\n+of the maintainer might be discussed in the regular Bitcoin Core IRC meeting,\n+but the actual decision making process occurs in the pull request.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.",

However, the role does include permissions on the\n+repository, and connotes a general sense of stewardship over the project.\n+\n+\n+Largely, the role of maintainers is to decide to merge Pull Requests.\n+\n+Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+maintainers.\n+\n+Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+principles of the project, meets the minimum standards for inclusion, and will\n+judge the general consensus of contributors. The review process that\n+establishes general consensus is detailed in\n+[CONTRIBUTING.mg](/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, one Bitcoin's maintainers was a designated \"Lead Maintainer\",\n+which was most recently @laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the unofficial\n+title of Lead Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a\n+bug-not-feature if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over\n+other General Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+There is no prohibition or process that differentiates self-merges from normal\n+merges.\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).",
