      "body": "@arvidn `ALLOW_WRAPAROUND` is a much better name. Updated!\r\n\r\nYes, the include sorting was deliberate.\r\n\r\nYes, the idea is to make it so that new code that relies on unsigned wrap-around semantics is annotated. I've now added the following to the developer notes to clarify:\r\n\r\n> Do not rely on unsigned wrap-around semantics unless there are good reasons for doing so (e.g. hashing). Functions that rely on on unsigned wrap-around semantics should be annotated using `ALLOW_WRAPAROUND`.\r\n>- *Rationale*: Code relying on unsigned wrap-around semantics is legal and well-defined but error-prone.\r\n\r\nLooks good?",
