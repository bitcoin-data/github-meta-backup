We have [removed support for system univalue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22646), and the API is already [marked as broken in our univalue repo](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/univalue-subtree#library-usage):\r\n> This is a fork of univalue used by Bitcoin Core. It is not maintained for usage by other projects. Notably, the API is broken in non-backward-compatible ways.\r\n\r\nI think we are at the point where we could remove the univalue \"subtree\" entirely, as having to go through the current cycle of merging changes into our subtree, and then pulling them here, only makes refactoring / cleanups more complicated, and results in us having to carry a stack of additional files we don't actually need in this repository.\r\n\r\n> and seems to have no upsides.\r\n\r\nThere are upsides. They are outlined in the PR description, and two other linked PRs.\r\n\r\n> It would appear to serve no purpose other than to try to make more work for others.\r\n\r\nIf by more work, you mean, it might make it more difficult for you to maintain Knots, which maintains build options and code that we have removed, then yes, that's possible. However Bitcoin Core isn't making engineering/maintainence decisions based on whether or not they are benficial for forks of this codebase.",

It might help to know what the specific problem is.\r\n\r\nOn the code review process and dealing with NACKs, maybe there are some improvements that could be made there, but we should worry about not slowing things down too much and creating more work for maintainers.

So I think you are NACKing the wrong pull request and reverting this commit does not magically reintroduce system library compatibility.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I am pretty sure that compatibility was already broken years ago and my attempts to upstream bugfixes to univalue didn't receive any comment at all in the time. Meaning, the upstream I am aware is unmaintained.  So while I agree on the goal of library compatibility, I don't think it is practically possible in this case.\r\n\r\nI am more than happy to revert the changes here if there is an alternative solution to the integer sanitizer crashes we are seeing.  My fuzz farm hit this issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25095#issuecomment-1121254719, which is why I created the fix. So any alternative solution (if there is any) should ideally not reintroduce the bug. 25095 has steps to reproduce for both fuzzing and normal RPC usage, but feel free to ping me for testing or review on the alternative solution.",

      "body": "> I am pretty sure that compatibility was already broken years ago\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, there was a tiny few places Core relied on an API break.\r\n\r\n> and my attempts to upstream bugfixes to univalue didn't receive any comment at all in the time.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any outstanding strict bugfixes, just an undesirable API for pushing booleans.\r\n\r\n> Meaning, the upstream I am aware is unmaintained.\r\n\r\nI agree that appears to be the case. However, its \"unmaintained\" at this time is simply \"stable with no known bugs\".\r\n\r\n> So while I agree on the goal of library compatibility, I don't think it is practically possible in this case.\r\n\r\nIt would in fact be trivial, as I demonstrated in #22412. In fact, it would even be easy to mark `push_back(bool)` as deprecated in our fork to avoid incompatibilities sneaking back in.\r\n\r\n>I am more than happy to revert the changes here if there is an alternative solution to the integer sanitizer crashes we are seeing. My fuzz farm hit this issue #25095, which is why I created the fix.\r\n\r\nThat's not applicable to _this_ PR at all.\r\n\r\nA portable fix would be to use get_int64() and range check it.

Then it can be \" C++17 modernised\", rewritten to improve performance, and take advantage of utility code that we are already maintaining.",

Personally I share your broader concerns here but they can add noise to the review process on a particular PR. I don't think either of you (or me for that matter) have anything to add to the technical discussion specific to this PR. We haven't been following the series of Core PRs leading up to this PR nor are we maintaining a consensus compatible fork of Core and understand the implications of this PR on that task. Hence an Approach NACK from us just adds noise to this PR and is inappropriate.",
