But the reason why you can get this github response immediately – is – not at least, because SMTP was not indiscreet overloaded or over-evolved. \n\nIIRC `SIGHASH_WITHINPUTVALUE` is controversial (at least I read concerns from @gmaxwell and @petertodd ) and the way how the protocol can evolve is certainly not by opening issues here. Consensus and P2P changes need a BIP first, broad discussions and support for it. Closing.\n",

Elements Alpha tries out one formulation that accomplish it, though our experience there suggests a different would would be better.\n\nI expect to see a comprehensive soft-fork CHECKSIG upgrade proposal forming within a couple months. (I would have expected earlier, but new discoveries and requirements have been turning up-- as well as other unfortunate distractions).  So I think no one should take the fact that an issue here asking for that proposal on BCT (which I think is a very poor proposal) was turned away means nothing will be done on this; quite the opposite; and likely on a timeframe shorter than could be done for the proposal on BCT.\n",
