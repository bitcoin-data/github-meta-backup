      "body": "Beer + rage = is what happened there. Let me apologize firstly, it is not often that someone gets me that excited. Sorry - even to @gmaxwell ( I doubt he cares but the offer is made ) anyhow : \n\nDespite the lack of love for the idea and the lack of even the remotest interest  of considering the idea of ANOTHER ( OMFG ) blockchain. I still believe it has merit to consider. \n\nI spent the last few days attempting to do just that @laanwj - make another blockchain mainly to delve into the code more deeply. Rest assured any attempts to fork the current 0.9 code for alts has been severely crippled due to a number of changes (YOU!) :) made by splitting out chainparms.cpp and changing main.cpp.  ( NB:I have no issue with this ) but I see pain in the future when it comes to spinning people up on exactly how all this works. Learning involves failing .. failing on production code is clearly not an option. Failing on ALT code is also not an option because it deviates from the codebase currently in play. SO ? what happens next? \n\nMy proposal among many others for this topic was to create a PROPOSED branch. for things like changing architecture fully .. I do get the purpose of testnet and its intent .. the problem is that anything done on testnet can also be done to the main blockchain which has obvious implications. This \"NEW\" blockchain would to all intents and purposes be perhaps a front end (or representation ) of the blockchain - perhaps abbreviated or somesuch idea. Same rules. Same protocol. Same keys. Same reward. OR it could just be a learning tool that doesn't force people into the ALT coin space but with simplicity in mind. Maybe just the barest mechanics with no real functionality to commercialize or pump. \n\nIt could be the transaction blockchain very much like what p2pool does .. i.e. almost temporary in nature. Imagine a distributed superblock front end. Or something like VMS where the mempool is syncronised and the back end remains almost static except for commits. \n\nAnyway. My hatchet is buried and my piece is said. I have much love for Bitcoin and no love for ALTS. So take it for for what it is.  \n\nPS : Grats on 0.9! Great works guys. \n",
