It worked fine a couple of weeks ago when I went to update after a couple of months of not connecting. Everything was updated fine and working properly. Then  I wanted to do a little test and opend an online account on Blockchain and transfered a minimal amount as a test. Test went fine but after that I was no longer able to open my Bitcoin Core wallet because of above descibed error.\r\n\r\nCan anybody help?\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n",
