    "title": "[22.0rc2] There are cases where the fee calculation is incorrect",
    "body": "Please read this, thinking that there may be such a possibility.\r\nI fork each version of Bitcoin to make Fujicoin. I am currently testing Fujicoin made from v22.0rc2.\r\nhttps://github.com/fujicoin/fujicoin\r\n\r\nI often create large transactions with more than 350 inputs, but in v22.0, I fail to transfer money due to lack of fee about once every few times and get into a \"not in memory pool\" state.\r\nThis phenomenon sometimes occurred in previous versions. It rarely occurred in v0.21.x, but it seems that the frequency increased in v22.0.\r\n\r\nSpecific explanation\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe following image is the dialog at the time of remittance.\r\n![fujicoin5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7656623/128798045-08037fc5-d4ea-4dd2-9a5d-813cbd33c14a.png)\r\n\r\nThe following images show the remittance result and its details.\r\n![fujicoin6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7656623/128798270-287f9586-4a31-449d-9e69-853a6a5c3b4b.png)\r\n\r\n![fujicoin7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7656623/128798285-dc45a05e-0d71-488a-8e03-a46d30de7bdc.png)\r\n\r\nI made a program with python and calculated fee from raw Tx. In my calculation the fee was 2.57729334.\r\nTherefore, it is correct to be out of memoly pool due to insufficient remittance fee.\r\nIn this case, the pre-remittance fee calculation is incorrect.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the figure, this phenomenon can be reproduced many times if the wallet state is the same.\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have any more parsing ability, so I can't identify what kind of transaction causes a calculation error.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I've never experienced this with regular size transactions. Transactions that could not be remitted can be canceled, so there is no actual harm. \r\n\r\nI think it's pretty difficult to identify this problem, but I think it's very good if it improves.\r\n",

For example someone was getting an error in NBitcoin recently for using lot of inputs: https://gitter.im/MetacoSA/NBitcoin?at=60eef4327473bf3d7825ab85\r\n\r\nDon't think there are any issues in Bitcoin Core so this issue is off-topic IMO.",

Since the fee is being underpaid, that means that the effective value of inputs is calculated to be higher than it actually is, which means that the size is being calculated smaller than it actually is. I don't see anything in our code that would cause this issue that would not be apparent in smaller transactions. It is possible that the wallet may be corrupted and contain some data that causes the size calculation of inputs to be incorrect, however I don't really know what would cause that (the size calculation is only dependent on scriptPubKeys and private keys).\r\n\r\nPossibly the issue is that there are some inputs which are causing the problem and so you are seeing the issue with only very large txs because they happen to include those inputs. This could be tested by using `fundrawtransaction` with only one input and making sure that only that input is in the funded tx. Then use `testmempoolaccept` (instead of `sendrawtransaction` so no transactions are actually sent) to see the tx works. If this hypothesis is correct, then some txs will fail and those inputs would be the problem.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I can't tell what the issue is without having a test case to experiment with myself.",

A rescan was performed, but the situation has not changed.\r\n\r\nSubsequent investigations revealed that:\r\n・I checked 24 transactions that failed to transfer money, but all of them have one \"vout\". There is no change vout.\r\n　Although the fee is insufficient, the total amount will not be less than the remittance amount. It's as if wallet considers fee to be zero.\r\n・Transactions that fail to remit use the output of change.\r\n・Successful large transactions do not use change outputs.\r\n\r\n・When all the change were locked, a big transaction will succeed. Conversely, unlocking will fail.\r\n・Change is bech32 address by default. I made a change and tested it by specifying \"legacy\" or \"p2sh-segwit\" with `-changetype`.\r\n・If I unlock only the \"legacy\" change and send money, it will fail. Also, even if I unlock only the change of \"p2sh-segwit\" and send the money, it will fail.\r\nIn short, using change fails a big transaction.\r\n\r\nA similar test was performed with fujicoin v0.21.0 qt.\r\nUnlock only bech32 change. Large transactions succeed. The transaction input contains the change.\r\nSimilar results were obtained by testing with \"legacy\" or \"p2sh-segwit\" change.\r\n\r\nWhat I can say for sure is that the v22.0rc2 and v0.21.0 wallets behave differently.",

      "body": "With bitcoin v22.0rc2 regtest, even if I blindly perform a reproduction test on a large transaction, it does not reproduce.\r\nSo I decided to create an environment similar to fujicoin's wallet.\r\nMy fuji coin wallet is a collection of generated coins of about 13.99 FJC.\r\nThe minimum fee for fujicoin is 10000sat / byte. On the other hand, bitcoin is 1sat / byte. So I made the bitcoin wallet a set of 0.001399 BTC.\r\nNext, I made 0.0002, 0.0003, 0.0004, 0.0005 change.\r\nThen, I sent 0.3BTC and 0.5BTC, but no error occurred as a result.\r\n\r\nWhat is interesting is the change generated at this time.\r\nAlthough the wallet is a set of 0.001399 BTC, large changes of 0.00974425 and 0.01009771 were generated.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in fujicoin, if the transaction is successful, a small change of about 3FJC is generated for the set of 13.99FJC.\r\n\r\nThis means that bitcoin has more transaction inputs. Of course, this difference is considered to be due to the difference in the fee-related parameters of bitcoin and fujicoin.\r\n\r\nThe fee-related parameters of fujicoin are as follows.\r\n```\r\nDEFAULT_MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE\t10000000\r\nDEFAULT_TRANSACTION_MAXFEE\t\t10 * COIN\r\nHIGH_TX_FEE_PER_KB\t\t1 * COIN\r\nHIGH_MAX_TX_FEE\t\t100 * HIGH_TX_FEE_PER_KB\r\nDEFAULT_BLOCK_MIN_TX_FEE\t10000000\r\nDEFAULT_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE\t10000000\r\nDUST_RELAY_TX_FEE\t3000\r\nDEFAULT_PAY_TX_FEE\t0\r\nDEFAULT_FALLBACK_FEE\t20000000\r\nDEFAULT_DISCARD_FEE\t100000000\r\nDEFAULT_TRANSACTION_MINFEE\t10000000\r\nWALLET_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE\t50000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich parameters are affecting the number of inputs in a transaction?\r\nIt is thought that the reason why the parameters have an influence on the creation of transactions is that the transaction-related programs have been significantly rewritten in v22.0.\r\n\r\n★ postscript:\r\nThis seems to be irrelevant as it is the same for bitcoin v0.21.0 and fujicoin v0.21.0.",

The culprit is that there are some places where we use an outputs real value rather than its effective value. I think the issue is much more apparent at high feerates because the difference between the effective value and the real value of an output is much larger so using the incorrect value means the calculation error can become big enough to be an issue.\r\n\r\nI'll have a fix shortly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe problem with the change outputs probably has to do with the size of the outputs rather than the fact that they are change.",
