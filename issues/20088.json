    "title": "fuzz: how to scale fuzzing with the number of fuzz targets",
    "body": "Having different fuzz targets is useful to give the fuzzer a specific and well defined task to work on. This makes it also easier for developers to see what an individual fuzz test/target is doing. Moreover, the fuzzer might be more performant in finding new inputs because the input directory as well as the search space is smaller.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also several downsides:\r\n\r\n* Limiting the overall search space the fuzzer can explore will make it impossible to reach coverage for the code paths that have been excluded.\r\n* Building numerous small fuzz targets, instrumenting them and linking them with debug symbols is costly in CPU time and disk space. A quick build is not only important for devs, but also for CI.\r\n\r\nSimilar to how the unit tests are compiled and linked into one binary, we could look into linking the fuzz targets into one binary. Individual targets could be selected with some kind of runtime argument.",

      "body": "Thanks for the ping @fanquake!\r\n\r\nWhen doing large scale fuzzing with the goal of reaching as good coverage as possible I think we definitely need support for one-binary-per-target.\r\n\r\nDon't take my word for it though: @kcc of C++ sanity fame who introduced the sanitizers, libFuzzer, OSS-Fuzz, CFI, etc. wrote this in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11045#issuecomment-334516409: \"I always advocate for one-binary-per-target because it makes fuzzing more efficient.\" :)\r\n\r\nAlmost all fuzzing platforms are written assuming such a structure with one binary per fuzzer and one corpus per binary. If passing runtime arguments is supported at all then `fuzzing_harness -t foo` and `fuzzing_harness -t bar` are typically expected to share the same corpus.\r\n\r\nWith that said I think it could make sense to add a configure option which would build the fuzzing harnesses as one binary (with individual targets selected as a runtime argument) to speed up normal day-to-day compilation. That could hopefully be enabled by default to make sure the fuzzing harnesses still compiles are non-fuzzing code changes (currently that is often noticed only at CI stage).\r\n\r\nWould that make sense?",

      "body": "> Almost all fuzzing platforms are written assuming such a structure with one binary per fuzzer and one corpus per binary\r\n\r\nOur primary concern is to be able to run the fuzzers ourselves, locally and on ci. With an increasing number of targets and increasing number of seeds, the compile-time and run-time for this will only ever increase. By default devs already don't compile the fuzz tests (#19388), let alone run them. We purely rely on ci for this, which again doesn't come with infinite resources.\r\n\r\nSupporting fuzzing platforms is a secondary goal. If they are not flexible enough to be configurable for our setting, then :shrug:. Regardless, have you tried creating wrapper bash scripts with the content `FUZZ=addr_deserialize ./src/test/fuzz.exe` and tried if that works for your favourite fuzzing platform?",
