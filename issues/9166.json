Some old TXs in that `wallet.dat` contain comments with non-ASCII chars encoded as **latin1**.\r\n\r\nIn this case it's the German Umlaut **ü** encoded as `0xFC` (latin1) instead of `0xC3BC` (UTF8).\r\n\r\n`bitcoind` passes the comment in it's JSON response to `bitcoin-cli` without transformation, so the parser in `bitcoin-cli` complains about the latin1 representation of that character.\r\n\r\nJSON must to be used with UTF8 encoding.\r\n\r\ntcpdump confirms that the problem only occurs with TXs with non-utf8 special chars in their comments.\r\n\r\nSkipping the TXs with the problematic comments works fine:\r\n\r\n> % bitcoin-cli listtransactions '*' 1 2\r\n> (...)\r\n\r\n### Does dumping wallet.dat with `db_dump`, modifying the dump file and `db_load` work as a workaround?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nStop `bitcoind`, make a **backup** of your `wallet.dat` file.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndb_dump -p -f dump.txt wallet.dat\r\ngrep -F comment dump.txt | perl -p -e 's#^.*comment(.*?)\\\\0b.*$#$1#'\r\n# this will output all your TX comments to inspect visually before modifying\r\nvim dump.txt\r\ndb_load -f dump.txt new.dat\r\nmv wallet.dat wallet.dat.orig\r\nmv new.dat wallet.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem: `grep` from above doesn't find all your comments. So there might still be comments left with latin1-encoded chars.\r\n\r\nMake 100% sure to replace the special chars only in your comments. Do not use search/replace! Replace each 1 byte char with exactly 1 byte ASCI char.\r\n\r\nIn my case I replaced `\\fc` with `u` (German `ü` --> `u`)\r\n\r\nIf you change the length of the string by replacing one special char with more than 1 char, you will get errors like the following on next start of `bitcoind`:\r\n\r\n> 2016-11-15 17:29:55 init message: Loading wallet...\r\n> Warning: Error reading wallet.dat! All keys read correctly,\r\n> but transaction data or address book entries might be missing or incorrect.\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way to handle this?",

      "body": "On the db_dump/db_load error, I think this would have to be caused by an accidental `\\fc` -> `_` replacement in a part of the dump that wasn't an address name. I don't know how many replacements you had to make, but if it was not too many, I might try visually inspecting a diff of the dump file before and after the replacements, or maybe just starting with a few replacements and then adding more so you can identify which one(s) cause the warning. Also if there aren't too many transactions, it might be easier to use the wallet gui interface to change the address labels rather than work with dump/load.\n\nOn the underlying bug which caused latin1 to be stored in the database rather than utf8, it looks like it was fixed in 2011 with the `setCodecForCStrings` call added here:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3f0816e3d926e0ea78ac7b6cd43efe62355885c8#diff-8c9d79ba40bf702f01685008550ac100R116\n\nOne improvement that might be a good idea to make now would be to have `UniValue::setStr` validate that strings passed to it are utf8. There actually already is utf8 validation code in the UniValue library (used during parsing), but it just isn't called right now by `UniValue::setStr`. Changing this could ensure that bitcoin never outputs invalid JSON, and make bugs like this one easier to track down and fix.\n",

It shouldn't do its own hidden munging of data. In this case it may make sense to have a two-pronged approach:\n- Make univalue validate strings as unicode, raise an exception if not.\n- Make sure bitcoind never feeds it invalid unicode. This means strings read from the wallet database will need to be sanitized. I don't think we have any other un-sanitized sources of strings that are reported on RPC (e.g. \"user agent\" strings from the network are already sanitized in an extremely strict way.)\n  - It should already be impossible for new non-unicode strings to get into the database, as unicode is checked on parsing the incoming JSON. So at least there will be no new cases.\n",

I then used vim and searched for the string `comment`. I found the TX comments with the comment being there in plain text. The ü chracter in this case was written as the 3 chars `\\fc`. I just replaced these 3 chars with `ue`, saved the file, reimported it via `db_load` and fired up bitcoind with the above mentioned error message.\n\nI did _not_ do a search/replace for `\\fc`. I did only edit the TX comments by hand.\n\nBut I guess bitcoind saves checksums over all the TXs in the wallet so this might have triggered the error message.\n\nAt the moment we have no solution so far.\n",

I should have thought of this myself.\n\nI'll try to do the dump/load thing again while replacing the 1byte special char with 1 char instead of 2 chars. That might work.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI can confirm that this is working. I just modified 2 production wallets that way. Will edit first post to reflect this.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nWith a third wallet the JSON parser still complained. Debugging this showed that one doesn't find all the comments through grepping for `comment` in the dump file.\n\nThe preferable way still would be that `bitcoind` would handle this somehow.\n",
