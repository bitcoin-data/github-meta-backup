    "body": "client 0.5.0\n\ni forgot my passphrase to my encrypted wallet. but i knew what it was approximately. so i guessed. 50+ times. one particular guess (which i'm assuming is the correct passphrase) causes the client to crash. so i can't send bitcoins or change my passphrase. updated to client 0.6.0. it also crashes on the same passphrase.\n\ngoogle says others have had a similar problem. but the issue was closed because it couldn't be reproduced.\n\ndbdump --wallet shows no errors. though this line looks suspicous:\n\nMaster Key 1: blah...blah, Salt: blah...blah. Passphrase hashed 83218 times with method 0 with other parameters 0x\n\ni haven't looked at the source but... that 83 thousand times thing looks kinda suspicious. is there a security feature that increases the passphrase hash count every time an incorrect passphrase is entered? is there a buffer or stack overflow thing going on when the hash count gets too high? chirp.\n",

      "body": "Update: I found the right pass it looks like the crash was being caused on an incorrect pass.\n\nUsing 0.6.0.6-beta trying (incorrect-password1) when attempting to send coins or change passwords the client crashes. Because of this I figured it was the correct password due to other incorrect passwords not causing the client to crash (they would just cause the client to report incorrect pass).\n\nFiguring that one or more of the keys were corrupted sipa gave me two custom clients. \n\nfirst patched client\nhttp://bitcoin.sipa.be/builds/0.6.0-1-gc8bd77b/ (404'd now I guess you should ask him if you really need it)\nWhen this was run with -recovery flag it checks all keys at decryption time and ignores the faulty ones, so if you use the wrong pass it wont have any funds since the decryption will fail. This tried to use a key that was removed (when i stupidly was using the wrong pass at this point) since it doesnt prevent the coin mechanism from choosing those coins or update the balance.\n\nsecond patched client\nhttp://bitcoin.sipa.be/builds/0.6.0-1-g694cc14/\nagain you run this with -recovery from the cli or it will just be the same as 0.6.0.6-beta I believe. Using this patch it reports in the debug output which keys were removed because of which reason, and should update the balance. So if you use the wrong pass decryption will fail and the balance will show 0.00.\n\nAfter writing down all permutations of what my pass could be I found the correct passphrase and the released 0.6.0.6-beta client works as expected. I'll email the empty wallet to gmaxwell and hopefully he can figure out why the wrong pass causes it to crash.\n",
