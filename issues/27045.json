    "body": "Scalability: Bitcoin's current architecture has scalability limitations, and efforts should be made to improve its ability to process a large number of transactions per second.\r\n\r\nPrivacy: While bitcoin is pseudonymic, it can still be traceable. Improving privacy could involve implementing privacy-enhancing technologies like Coinjoin or zero-knowledge proofs.\r\n\r\nInteroperability: Making it easier for different bitcoin-based systems to interact with each other could help to foster innovation and adoption.\r\n\r\nSecurity: The code should be continuously audited and improved to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nUsability: Improving the user experience could involve making the software easier to use, speeding up confirmation times, or simplifying the process of setting up a full node.\r\n",
