    "body": "Update: This issue has been closed by Blockstream-related persons many times, like this one #10716 #10716 #10717 I was banned too. It's not okay to close this issue without providing any solution or making any promise. “The cat shuts its eyes when stealing cream” strategy does not work, as for me.\r\n\r\nHi, @laanwj , we all know you colluded with Blockstream to hijack this repo. Although many people asked you to return it back to Gavin, you refused by seeing it as your private property.\r\n\r\nWell, the whole Bitcoin community has stood up to create a new Bitcoin reference repo github.com/btc1/bitcoin Which is supported by hashrate majority, economic majority, and user majority.\r\n\r\nPlease curb your Luke-jr from spamming lies and propaganda to attack Bitcoin, like this btc1#55\r\n\r\nYou have been warned.\r\n\r\nTo test, I submitted a similar post here, and in minutes was it not only closed but also deleted by a Blockstream staff. #10713\r\n\r\nCurb yourself. Bitcoin is here to stay, with or without hijacked Core.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your life in this echo chamber. Anyway, you can't hijack Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAny extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.",
