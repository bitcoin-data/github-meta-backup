    "body": "It seems some bright spark has decided that getinfo command is not needed in new versions of the daemons, and removed it.\r\nNow you need one command to see the amount of blocks, another one to see the amount of connections, and one more to see the balance.\r\nBut now there are:\r\ngetblockchaininfo\r\ngetmempoolinfo\r\ngettxoutsetinfo\r\ngetmemoryinfo (\"mode\")\r\ngetmininginfo\r\ngetaddednodeinfo ( \"node\" )\r\ngetnetworkinfo\r\ngetpeerinfo\r\ngetwalletinfo\r\nwhich individually do not provide general information.\r\nThank you developers. Remove this command in your own wallets. But take getinfo back to me, leave the possibility to compile with this command.\r\n\r\nI do not understand the meaning of your innovation if it deprives the user of convenience.",

      "body": "@kangasbros, you've already made your opinion known in #11382 . This has been discussed multiple times in multiple venues.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, getinfo requires information from multiple subsystems. The implementation is messy, and the locks all over the place make it difficult and expensive to maintain. Keeping it would mean we can't do refactors to clean up wallet and rpc code, burdening the project with long-term technical debt.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core is an open source project. You are completely free to fork the code and do the work necessary to maintain this code. Complaining that other people aren't doing that work for you achieves nothing.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I suggest we lock this issue. No new substantive arguments are being made to revert the change.",
