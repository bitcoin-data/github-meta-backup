Even when downloading large files from Taiwan (which is slow from France and may occasionally interrupt a TCP session in the middle, this is detected, and the download is resumable, never truncated silently).\r\n\r\nI've also tried using other web browsers on other OSes and machines (including tryuing to download directly with a dedicated service on my web router), and even on alternate Internet providers (e.g. on my mobile phone over a 4G or 5G connection), I get exactly the same early truncation of the EXE file than when using my fiber access. If I look at HTTP headers, there's seems to be an inconsistancy between when is reported as the available byteranges. Notealso that I do not use any external frontend cache using any large local store, so that cannot be the cause, and with whatever method, the final filesizes and recomputed hashes (MD5 + SH256) are always the same on all machines used (so this is not a transient problem).",

      "body": "I found some related but obscure events in the Event Registry:\r\nApps & Services Logs > Windows > AppId > Operational\r\n\r\nThe app cannot be authenticatd with the embedded signatures.\r\n\r\n- Source: AppId; EventID: 4004\r\n  - AppID service was called to check the signature of \\?\\C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe.\r\nStatus Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xfffffffe.\r\n\r\nIt occurs after several error events like\r\n\r\n- Source: AppID; Id: 4008\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AiSvcVerifyFile called AiGetTrustedPublisherName, which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xfffffffe).\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AiGetTrustedPublisherName called AipGetFileSignature, which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xc0070490).\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AipGetFileSignature called CryptCATAdminEnumCatalogFromHash, which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xc0070490).\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AipGetFileSignature called WinVerifyTrust(WTD_CHOICE_FILE), which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0x800b0100 = MissingSignature). (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wintrust/nf-wintrust-winverifytrust and https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource/blob/master/System.Core/System/Security/Cryptography/SignatureVerificationResult.cs)\r\n\r\nSo this looks like the embedded Authenticode signatures in the installer.exe fails to be checked, and Windows blocks the execution. There are certificates present, but visibly some upstream PKI is not reachable by me from France (blocked by US export restrictions, or some failing internet links to check its authenticity or a certificate that has been blacklisted? or a root CA certificate missing in Windows for France? I've seen such issues with some SSL websites using some Oracle hosting services for their PKI, notably some which are used by advertizers, but blocked in the US-EU safe harbour agreement from being installed by default). The certicate chain in your EXE does not validate up to its trusted root, or there's a missing counterpart signature.\r\n\r\nBut more likely your developer certificate for trust (used for Authenticode) is expired (or has been revoked) and has not been renewed. Did you forget to pay a yearly billing to renew it before building it in May? Did you install the renewed certificate in your building environment? Did you forget to request some authorizations before signing your request and asking to your PKI provider to authenticate your signature? Did you update your \"mingw\" installation to get such certificate (if not, you can just self-sign your app for use on your own machine and it works because you have the private keys, but cannot distribute it so that it validates on other machines or in other countries than yours)?\r\n\r\nSo for now, the prebuilt installer.exe for v0.23 won't work. The only work around is to use the installer.exe from v0.22, then overwrite EXE files that are currently in the downloadable ZIP for v0.23 (when extracting them from the ZIP, Windows requests user permission as the signature does not seem trustable; probably the v0.23 installer.exe does the same, but does not have the builtin capability to ask permission to the user with a GUI dialog, and just fails instantly to extract and install anything; apparently it can just perform a basic CRC check but the Authenticode verifications for the extracted files are enforced now by Windows and such CRC check is just insufficient and unnecessary, even if it passes); or build them ourself using the sources and installing the mingw building environment (installing WSL if needed; note that I have WSL installed) to compile it for our own host (but not signing them publicly, or just self-signing them for our own local use no our machines with our personal certificates generated locally) not for redistribution on the Net.\r\n\r\nFor now your v0.23 installer.exe contains only a single self-signed signature, authenticating only a date/timestamp, not the authenticity of code; yes you publish an external SHA256 hash for the whole file (different from the embedded SHA256 hash used only to sign your timestamp, countersigned by your PKI provider), but it seems to be insufficient (for the code you just perform the basic check on CRC, but the intaller engine you use wants more and probably refuses to install any extracted EXE files without any kind of authentication when your signed timestamp comes after some timestamp limit that expired or was revoked for any use after some authenticated limit.",

      "body": "Also I tried to compare PE/EXE headers (with \"dumpbin.exe filename\" from a command line prompt)  between the v0.22 and v0.23 EXE installers.\r\n\r\nThey show some differences:\r\n\r\n- The .text section is now shorter (size of raw data: 9000 hex in v0.22 vs. 8000 in v0.23)\r\n- All sections (.text, .data, .rdata, .xdata, .pdata, .bss, .idata, .ndata, .rsrc) have less flags (e.g. for \".text\", we got 60000020 hex, including two additional \"RESERVED - UNKNOWN\" flags in v0.22, where as v0.23 just has flags 60000020 hex, for \"Code\", and \"Execute Read\")\r\n- The virtual address of that section grows from 0000000000401000 to 000000000040908F in v.022, to 0000000140001000 to 0000000140008F9F in v0.23, by being offseted by 000000010000000\r\n\r\nAnd of course the size of the \"Certificates directory\" has grown (this is where you append the archived files to extract, in the padding left after your basic timestamp signature. Using such huge padding area without certifying with their own signatures is not really supported by Microsoft, and can cause the Authenticode loader of Windows to fail if it exhausts some internal limits; that padding area is only supported if it contains only zeroes. This may have worked with legacy installers, but not for such installer package that is now too big; it's likely that Authenticate expects to find a reasonable end of this padding area (which is not secured at all... that's why you need your custom CRC check for the whole file in the loader), or it may now exhaust the workign area permitted for custome loaders (and given that you'e reduced the .text area, the loader may not have enough virtual space allocated in memory to process the archived contents stored in the certificates directory, notably if it wants to decompress it, or you may need to increase the declared sizes for the BSS, stack reserve, or heap reserve, or their initial committed sizes that are quite small (4KB), notably if the new files require larger lookup window size for some LempelZiv-like or deflate decompression.\r\n\r\nSome other changes are also related to the build tool change (notably the linker version from 2.34 to 2.37, installed with the Windows SDK or updated by Windows update for recent builds). In the installer EXE v20.22 there was an additional characteristic in the main header, indicating that relocations were stripped (no longer the case, so addresse randomization may no longer work, and Windows now no longer wants to execute programs with non randomized virtual addresses).\r\n\r\nIf you upgraded your build chain (may be not mingw itself, used to compile the provided BT tools, but the chain used to build the installer), you may need to add additional flags for using the new linker.\r\n\r\nAnd may be your existing install engine tool (NSIS?) you used no longer works with updated linkers from the Windows SDK, or needs to be updated too to support new restrictions applied with this newer linker.",

This doesn't seem to be related to any recent changes in our code / build system, and is going to be hard to debug without the environment that the issue is occuring in.\r\n\r\nI think the content in this comment, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25726#issuecomment-1200132034, is the most informative, and points to some sort of local networking / user configuration issue:\r\n> So this looks like the embedded Authenticode signatures in the installer.exe fails to be checked, and Windows blocks the execution. There are certificates present, but visibly some upstream PKI is not reachable by me from France (blocked by US export restrictions, or some failing internet links to check its authenticity or a certificate that has been blacklisted? or a root CA certificate missing in Windows for France? I've seen such issues with some SSL websites using some Oracle hosting services for their PKI, notably some which are used by advertizers, but blocked in the US-EU safe harbour agreement from being installed by default). The certicate chain in your EXE does not validate up to its trusted root, or there's a missing counterpart signature.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever searching hasn't seemed to turn up any obvious solutions / references to anything similar.",

      "body": "Of course Windows can connect on the Internet (and I'm writing here from the same machine with the same OS, Windows 11).\r\nIf something fails, that's most probably because the new installer.EXE file was effectively built using a different linker version, and Windows 11 may assume that with this version it enforces new security restrictions (notably for Authenticode checks).\r\n(and this is independant of how the EXE files appended and archives at end of the initial part of the installer EXE are built themselves. As the new embedded EXE files archived there, in the area normally reserved only for adding signatures, have grown in size, it seems that the new linker version used in the premiary part has reached an upper limit on ho far it can process that area, so it most likely cannot even make its own CRC compaution of that area, which is not signed by itself.\r\nIn 2013, Microsoft instructed developers to NOT use that area except for storing signatures, and so most probably the new linker used in the main part of that file makes such assumption. As a result the problem cannot load at all (and I've tried to load it on various versions of Windows, it lever loads).\r\n\r\nYou probably need to check again the NSIS or script that you used to build that installer EXE file. Something has changed in your buildchain (but it is not visible in the sources we can see here).\r\n\r\nFor now the only workaround is to use the former installer for v0.22 (to setup some registry value or icons in start menus), then overwrite all the installed directory (created in \"C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\") to replace it with those coming in the new v0.23 ZIP file. But the v0.23 installer EXE does not run at all (except possibly on the machine where it was built, due to some local developer tweaks, or because of its local Internet setttings, such as for DNS, or firewalls, or local caches in their local routers, or there's a dependency to have an authorized link to some PKI provider that is not reachable/not routable from elsewhere).\r\n\r\nNote that I use other softwares that are using installers also based on the NSIS installer engine, they have no problem.\r\nBut even trying to load that installer EXE v0.23 with a debugger fails: we get the error message above before we can attach the debugger to the loaded image (and that loading program failure is reported to Microsoft vis its own telemetry systems, but we get no diagnostic at all and no return from Microsoft, most probably because this installer in just incompatible with Windows requirements; it's not a valid EXE image).\r\n\r\nSo you probably need to check how your NSIS building tools are installed (if it was upgraded, the current \"share/setup.nsi.in\"  script may need other tunings to make it work with the new version, notably those related to security, or minimal section sizes needed to run your very basic CRC check in the embedded custom loader function: I see that one section ni your new v0.23 installer is smaller than the previous version, it has been reduced by 4KiB and the Windows linker used has changed as well). Anyway this CRC check (now enforced by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b3ccf26df47c70e7559625a0e65205648f64efb7) is really too basic, in fact completely futile, to be really useful against malware injections in the archive part appended in the padding area at end of the EXE. It should better use SHA256.\r\n\r\nWith CRC32, you can still inject arbitrary files, plus a dummy file with 4 null bytes, compute the new CRC, and complement the result to set these 4 bytes and it will pass this check; this requires jsut a few nanoseconds; it will be much more difficult if you use a strong hash like SHA256 because it requires finding a collision by some brute force, even if there are some accelerations. For example the new tools now use an extra DLL (bitcoin tools are no longer completely staticalyl linked), which is located on another directory, but which may be easily defeated by injecting another DLL (with the same name) which will be placed in the \"bin/\" subdirectory: run the unmodified tools, and that injected malware DLL will be loaded when the tools will start running (those tools as well do not perform any self-consistancy check in their own loaders, given that they are also not securely signed individually as well!).\r\n\r\nAnd that area should not just contain an archive of EXE files to install, but also a signed catalog listing files to be extracted, instead of blindly installing every file that may be appended in that padding area (meaning that this installer is still not safe at all, so that I don't think that this is a Windows bug but a very useful feature if Windows refuses to load it).\r\n\r\nOr may be it will only run if we change advanced security settigns in Windows (such as \"image randomization\" or the \"real-time protection\", or \"cloud-based security\", or \"virtual-based security\": did you turn them off and did not used their default settings for Windows?) Note that Microsoft is constantly adjusting its own \"Windows Defender\" settings, and I'm running also n a machine where \"Advanced Windows Defender\" is on (and I cannot disable it at all), and there are a few other security settings enforced by MDM and Intune management, against the injection of malwares.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I would urge you to instruct users to NEVER use your advertized \"upgrade\", notably those that have a local installation with their personal wallets (all currency contents could be stolen instantly by the injected malware, or the malware could severely impact the P2P Bitcoin network by performing DDoS attacks, to facilitate attacks against large wallet holders or Bitcoin currency exchanges, or to take control of that network, by injecting large falsified chains and taking control of it, ruining many Bitcoin currency holders, if there are enough corrupted installations of Bitcoin tools acting together to gain the consensus; note that the new DLL in v0.23 is exactly made for that: controling the consensus!).\r\n\r\nSo for now I consider v0.23 really unsafe (with its DLL); only v0.22 is (moderately) safe (but it can still be easily compromized to steal local wallets, if they are not managed by a trusted external wallet service so that local wallets contain only 0.00BTC all the time, or are left completely unused).\r\n\r\nUsing the \"CRCCheck\" feature of NSIS is not a security measure; it's just a basic consistancy check. It cannot replace a proper \"Authenticode\" signature, but if you use the latter, then \"CRCCheck=force\" is futile, and should even be \"CRCCheck=off\"!\r\n\r\nGiven the amount of BTC money that a Bitcoin Core can control, I don't think it is reasonable to not securely sign it (on Windows with authenticode, or on Linux with catalogs in safe repositories, but always with cryptographically string signatures, at least SHA2-256, but now SHA2-512, or maybe SHA3-256...SHA3-512 if the target system supports the SHA3 algorithms and you don't provide an installable implementation); taking some small time to compute a strong hsh on any program installation is a requirement, independantly of what that program will then do; that time occurs only once during the installation or upgrade. As well, the installer can create a self-signature without modifying the file if that signature is stored in a separate catalog, or inserted in a \"stream\" (when the EXE file is stored on a NTFS or ReFS volume).",

Then download your v0.23 installer EXE and try running it (using the v0.22 installer.exe works without any problem). Such VM (in a shared machine) will also allow testing it in the most security-restricted situations (however these VM are known to run on the best and latest CPU models; you may have to choose which kind of CPU you'll get, I always used an Intel Core x64, and did not test with AMD).\r\n\r\nYou could do that as well on other VM hosting providers which allow installing Windows desktop OSes, and using it with some RDP client.",

If you see the error dialog above, you see the problem: Windows does not accept it as a valid executable.\r\n\r\nBut now you'll need to use Windows debuggers: your VM may need to have developer tools installed, including Mingw running  a VM inside a VM to compile it, so your basic test VM may require some additional storage; but you should be able to use developer tools on your own PC, and use \"remote debugging\" to deploy and test the installer inside the Azure VM (this requires Windows development skills and knowledge about how to use NSIS, so that a basic user will not know how to do that; and your Azure VM must then be at least running Windows 7, but likely Windows 10, as Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 are in end of life and may not run in free test VMs on shared Azure machines).\r\n",

      "body": "So this finally confirms what I had: this is an issue which is probably caused by ASLR, and the fact that the new version of NSIS reduced the size of a segment.\r\n\r\nASLR need some memory to create the remapping table for some segments, by allocating it at end of the \".text\" segment before turning it readonly, this is where it will place \"the jump table\" for redirecting thunks. The sizes of segments that have been set with the new linker settings used by NSIS seem to be too restrictive (you can look at the PE EXE header: one segment has been shrunk by 4KB, it's possibly that ASLR can no longer work in this too tiny environment).\r\nAlso all PE sections had two extra flags, see what I wrote above.\r\n\r\nWhen I was replied that nothing was changed in sources, it's possible with the sources published here (i.e. the \"nsis.in\" script)... except that you've upgraded your installation of NSIS in your build environment and changed the linker, probably by upgrading mingw or the GCC build chains, including its linker (this is visible in the version of the linker included to the PE EXE header of the installer).\r\n\r\nNote: I CANNOT turn off the randomization in \"Security > System settings\" not even by inserting an exception. This is ON by default per policy (the same occurs also in my Azure account for the test VM I used, and all the PC's I've tried on Windwos; it is enforced with my licences and microsoft account synchronization, by various Microsoft management tools like MDM, Intune, Windows Defender, Credit Guard...).\r\n\r\nAlso note that ALL executables are marked to prevent execution of data (see System properties > Performance options > Enable prevention of execution of data for all programs and services, except those listed; it may not be activated there, whereas the default in Windows is to enable it only for Windows programs and services; but a group policy may still enforce it; note also that my list of exceptions there is also empty, but anyway it is not used, because \"NX\" is enforced everywhere for all data segments, meaning that you cannot place executable dynamic thunks in data segments, but place them in a readonly segment; ASLR updates them at load time, updates the relocations then changes the segment settings to executable).\r\n\r\nAll this is done by the system user and not the current user; if a program wants to use a cosutm loader, it needs some extra flags, plus some security tokens and signed certificates; all this occurs before any instruction of the loaded program is executed, and not even a debugger can to attach the image, except possibly a kernel debugger and only when loading Windows in debug mode; the only debugger that gets attached to that image is the one used inside Windows Defender or system crash handler, that's why your installer has a crash dump submitted to Microsoft which did not publish a shim for the new version of NSIS to mitigate a restriction). You should read the release not of the new version of NSIS that you've used if this requires adjustments to you NSIS script or to the NSIS building tools and its environment.\r\n\r\nAnd may be the previous version of NSIS did not need relocations and thunks, if it was statically built to use only PIC code. But now it may have relocation tables, that the program loader needs to fix for ASLR by adding thunks, but the segment size settings in your NSIS builder does not allocate that extra space in the generated EXE image (and this cannot be changed later if you've already \"signed\" the image and computed the SHA256 checksum that you ask us to verify.",

I can click OK.\r\n\r\nBut then nothing else happens; I do not even get the error dialog above; the program does not load and I jsut see the eventIDs 4004 and 4008 in the Event Handler, plus the program being reported to Microsoft with a \"minidump\".\r\n\r\nSo This is most likely a bug of your new version of NSIS or in one of its toolchain, no longer working with programs compiled with MINGW and the gcc chaintool, possibly a bug in its new version for the linker, or a missing configuration for the \".text\" segment or some segment attributes, or incorrect memory alignment settings or security settings for some segments. Or yu've linked it with the incorrect \"sinit.obj\" for the C runtime library, forgetting to prepare some extra segments needed for ASLR, or not correctly detecting that ASLR is used by the loader. And may be the stack segment allocated is just too small for the new NSIS engine if you also call a custom function for your CRC check; or you need to allocate some more space for the heap if the you NSIS loader needs more. Sies indicated in the PE EXE header are ridiculous small, even smaller than ni v0.22 (may be because your new NSIS is not aware that you use a custom function needing extra space for its own temporary buffers, because the new version needs now less space for decompressing files from the appended archive part of the file; NSIS probably has some performance tuning parameters for those buffers but you've still used its default minimum settings)!",

Using the padding area of EXE files for storing a custom archive (notably after certicates) is unsupported (there's not even the warranty that the Windows loader will place that area into memory, it may just \"prefetch\" it only the filesystem cache, but not map it at all in the virtual memory of the module being loaded (for a process creation of for dynamic linking).",

But when I run it, I no longer have the permission request from Windows (the extra \"stream\" indicating that the file was downloaded from the net and tracking its original web source is also dropped; that stream however is not visible in File Explorer and is not counted as the filesize; but the personal metadata inside the EXE is present).\r\n\r\nSo now if I run it, i get again the error dialog \"0xc000007B\" and the EventID's 4004 and 4008 in the Events Viewer, and the program reported to Microsoft with a minidump. So really this EXE image is still invalid, it cannot be safely loaded; linker options or too small segment sizes are most probably the cause.\r\n\r\nCan you build an image without the legacy \"CRCcheck\" option in your NSIS input script? If this works now, this is likely caused by that: the new NSIS does not correctly compute the memory requirements for that function to work correctly and the Wnidows laoder did not provide it enough memory space (in the stack or in some BSS or heap segments to place the needed buffers allowing it to perform I/O on the whole EXE file and not just on the image partially loaded by Windows).",

I get this message (in French because VS Studio 2022 is installed and running on the French system locale) when dumping the relocation entries:\r\n\r\n> LINK : fatal error LNK1337: le binaire contient plus de réadressages de base que ce que son répertoire de réadressages de base indique\r\n\r\nThis does not occur with the v0.22 installer.\r\n\r\nSo this is a bug in the linker used with your mingw suite (the EXE contains signatures from \"GCC: (GNU) 10.3.0\".)\r\nI think this is a bug of its PE EXE linker (linker version v2.37 reported now in the PE EXE header, it was linker version 2.34 in the v0.22 installer, which was compiled with \"GCC: (GNU) 7.5.0\"). Or you need a bugfix upgrade for your version of NSIS; alternatively you may attempt to revert your mingw/GCC environment to use GCC 7.5.0 to build the NSIS installer (nothing to change for building the Bitcoin*.exe tools for now). NSIS requires LOT of relocation and it does not compile correctly the Windows installer with GCC 10.3.0.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\n* https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95620\r\n\r\nASLR cannot work if it can't allocate the correct number of redirecting thunks as indicated in the PE EXE header. But without ASLR, no dynamic relation updates has to be performed, the sections can be directly mapped to memory at the indicated virtual adresses of the process, provided that it is large enough, as no redirecting thnk is needed and no patch is needed in the relocation entries that are completely unused in this case.\r\n\r\nOther projects have had serious problems when upgrading GCC 7/8 to GCC 10. But here we find a case where it generates bad code that cannot be safely linked (some table limit exhausted), or that this is a bug in its \"ld\" linker, not properly building the PE EXE header (possibly assuming that some relocations were optimized and removed, when they were not; may be this could be solved by compiling the NSIS installer as PIC; the code may be a bit slower and the generated code a bit larger, but it's not dramatic for an installer).",

      "body": "Just consider using DUMPBIN (the free tool provided by Visual Studio 2022).\r\n- Try running: DUMPBIN /ALL 'bitcoin-(version)-win64-setup.exe' >log\r\n- look at the \"LINK : fatal error LNK1337\" occuring while dumping the \".pdata\" section.\r\n- look at \"Relocations stripped\" info displayed in the header for v0.22, but not for v0.23.\r\n- You can detect the GCC version used by looking at the end of the dumped \".text\" section in the log file. It is different even if you (supposedly) used the same version of NSIS (IMHO it's not the case, the \".text\" code section is larger now).\r\n- You can detect the linker version in the headers at top of file. It is different even if you used the same version of NSIS.\r\n\r\nThere may be equivalent dump tools for the GCC suite (but they make different assumptions, possibly based on Linux capabilities) to inspect the relocation entries, and see by yourself that their effective number don't match what is catalogued in the PE headers. Who's wrong? GCC generating fake/duplicate relocation entries, or the linker not properly updating the EXE header when it terminates its job, or NSIS using GCC or LD with incorrect options? Or your build environment that selects the incorrect version of GCC/LD, if multiple versions are installed in the system (check the paths, symbolic links, \"alternatives\" in Linux)? Is is even possible that you mixed tools/library/data/config paths between x64 and arm64, or between Windows and Linux, using different formats, models or different constraints for the same x64 architecture, assuming that the EXE will run in a Cygwin environment for example which uses a different binary image loader and not the native Windows image loader)\r\n\r\nSuch bug won't be resolved (or checked) by signing tools you use to append the signatures (so signatures may look valid for Get-PESecurity in Powershell).\r\n\r\nNote also that Mingw is a thin layer allowing to use GCC or related tools, as if they were running on Linux; but it uses the Windows build tools, notably its linker (\"ld\" is an emulation; \"gcc\" may generate correct COFF files for Win32, but it supports other models, such as Cygwin; there are other tools if you run them in WSL, which use a thick layer running a true Linux VM inside Hyper-V, and so it doesnot use the Win32 API directly). Here we are not running the EXE installer for Windows in Cygwin or WSL; but your NSIS installation may have been confused to run with tools compiled for Cygwin emulation layer instead of the Mingw64 thin layer. Some GCC options that work in Linux/WSL or in Cygwin won't run in a native Wni32 environment or in Mingw.\r\n\r\nI don't know which version of NSIS you used, and unfortunately there's NO build actual script that checks the NSIS installation and runs it. All we have a a basic script file, indicatign nothing about the envuironmetn where it will be processed. May be you need to contact NSIS experts on their support forum and see how they have setup a clean environment (that you could also host in the same mingw64 environment you use to produce the individual compiled tools.\r\n\r\nSo you should integrate the NSIS construction rules inside your makefile. Or you may look at https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Category:Development_Environments\r\n(such as https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Visual_Studio_Code which installs the NSIS plugin for Visual Studio Code from the CLI environment of Visual Studio Code)\r\n\r\nBut how to be sure about version stability of all this? May be you can add environment checks inside the NSIS script itself to assert that it will run properly (it can check paths, versions, registry entries, required external tools, and guide the user if it needs something else; as well it can perfectly make validation checks after building the EXE even if it does not proceed to the next step, i.e. authenticode signatures, or just produces a self-signed executable that will run on your local machine where the personal certificate is installed; that self-siganture can then be replaced by an authentic one for distribution, generated in a safe environment by some of your trusted admins...)",

      "body": "Have you tried to compiled it with -fPIC or -fPIE with gcc?\r\nIt looks like new versions of gcc use a type of relocation which is not supported by ASLR; as well the tool which is supposely used to remove all relocations (by setting absolute virtual address for segments in the uer space), seems in fact to compile a table of redirecting thunks at end of the text segment: addresses resolved by the linker to be in the same segment will use relative jumps everywhere with PIC or PIE, but still there are relations needed that must be resolved in the program loader after ASLR has randomized the effective location of segments in the virtual space. Those thinks should not be in the .text segment but in a specific segment that can be loaded as read-write data, then updated by the loader (which may randomie the redirections) that will transform it. ASLR however has a limitation: the number of relocatable segments shuold be small, so the total number of relocatable thunks should also be small. But in the v0.23 it is incredibkly huge, so it is very likely that you did not try the -fPIC or -fPIE in GCC, or that gcc forgets to group them in the same section and mark that section to be mapped in the same virtual space as the .text section and at a static address relative to the start of the .text section.\r\nWhat I can see is that the v0.22 installer effectively had its relocations completely stripped successfuly, this is no logner the case.\r\n\r\nHave you also tried to rebuild an installer for v0.22 with your current NSIS installation? Is it successful? If not, this a clear sign that you no longer use the same NSIS version (or your installation when compiling \"makensis\" from the NSIS sources was broken, you may need to recompile \"makensis\" with the old version of GCC.\r\n\r\nI'ver seen various comments in NSIS support indicating that the \"makensis\" engine (which is in fact a compiler language generating some pcode that will be interpreted) does not support all kinds of relocations. As well building \"makensis\" and running it in Linux to build a runtim that will run in mingw64 will not work. You need to build makensis in the same mingw64 environement (and note that it compiles TWO binaries, one for x86 and another for x64, don't confuse the two, only one is correct if you target a 64bit windows for the generated installers).\r\n",
