    "body": "The JSON RPC allows one to create accounts at a whim. However, there is little functionality for getting rid of old accounts.\n\nFor example, if I deal with a customer, I create an account \"Order 1\" to let them pay into the account. After I am done dealing with the order, I can't really get rid of the account. This way, even after many months, I would still see it in the account list, even if I don't need it.\n\nI wouldn't want to delete the addresses associated with the account, but I would like to have an option of merging that \"Order 1\" account into for example \"Archive\" account. Currently I can only try getting that functionality by listing all addresses owned by an account and assigning them individually to a different account.\n",

      "body": "Okay, I guess there are two similar things one could want to do with an account:\n\n1) Rename an account\nThis should be the easier of the two. Change the name of the account everywhere it was used - transactions, moves, balances and so forth. This would be useful when someone would for example be programming something and have to switch the naming convention mid-operation. Work only on whole accounts, not individual addresses (that is offered elsewhere). Allow for account merging this way, and \"deletion\", by letting people rename an account into something that is already present.\n\n2) Archive an account\nSimilarly as before, but upon execution the fact would be noted in the log/transaction history, and all money-related records would remain unchanged. A transaction that was sent to account X will still say it was sent to X, but the account would not be usable until it would be created again. The old addresses would be moved to a new account. This would allow users to clean up all addresses from old accounts into some \"archive\" account, while still keeping their transactions traceable.\n\nI know the option 2 would require a lot more work, but I think the first one shouldn't be too hard.\n\nWell, that's my proposal. Any thoughts?\n",

      "body": "I was looking through bitcoin issues at github for something useful that I could fix.  I found \"accounts - allow account merging/deletion\"  although it's a year old. This is basically a request for the ability to remove addresses from the wallet.  \n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1894\n\nI'm thinking that this would be a good thing to implement for privacy, because it would allow people to remove addresses once they've been used.  The semantic problem is that the removed addresses, although made zero-balance on command when the client deletes them, are still visible to other users of the blockchain, and somebody out there will  send transactions to old addresses whose creator wants to not use those addresses any more.  \n\nIn order to fully support the removal of old addresses, I think that \"burn this address\" needs to result in a transaction that is stored in the blockchain. It would be a transaction with that address as input and no output - forwarding any 'dust' in the address to whichever miner harvests the block.  Transactions created later would be considered valid but nonstandard if they use such \"burnt\" addresses in any way.  IE, they would not cause any client to reject them on syncing the blockchain, but \"savvy\" clients would neither create such transactions nor relay them. \n\nIn a later world, if it is found that 98% + of all clients making tx in the last 2016 blocks are \"savvy\" then the hardfork of making it into an invalid transaction could happen. \n",

While it might make sense to remove private keys after they receive their transaction, it's dangerous and I'm not sure there's a real use case. Removing an address doesn't really make sense - other than maybe hiding it on the address list or something.\n\nRemoving an account would simply hide it from the listaccounts list.\n\nI see a value in integrating @petertodd's dust-b-gone concept, but not so much your proposed \"burn this address\"; addresses do not store coins. It certainly wouldn't justify a hardfork...\n",
