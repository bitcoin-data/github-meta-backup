    "title": "Decouple build system from source. Use CMake to help newcomers and ecosystem!",
    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\n#### New Developers unable to quickly get up and going in their IDE\r\n\r\nThe current  build system is very brittle and the custom tailored nature of  it leaves the development team having to address constant breaking changes and new architectures etc. It also leaves new comers to the project in a state of despair when they realize that the current IDE cannot pick up the project. \r\n\r\nFor example in this issue #13694 , the user asked \"where I could find the guide on how to install an IDE and debug the code?\" because his top of the line IDE, CLion works by using CMake. The other well known C/C++ IDEs that are currently used are able to and appear to prefer the CMake build system. Sadly, the sarcastic response (i hope) from @sipa was \"Most developers don't use IDEs as far as I know\".\r\n\r\nFor the Windows users out there, in issue #14118 , the issue got alot of support to the idea of adding CMake, as one is able to quickly work on C/C++ projects given Visual Studio's and VSCode support for CMake projects.\r\n\r\n#### Improve ecosystem by having option to build shared libraries\r\n\r\nThis last point will be a simple theory, but if CMake is added, one could imagine that the ecosystem to grow and flourish and bring in new support and tooling with it. For instance, if i wanted to instead wrap around the C++ code using CFFI and call directly from Python/JS/Whatever I am unable to as where would I even begin to get started on compiling a library as opposed to the executable in a neat manner? Right now the best way to interact with bitcoin is via the rpc it seems, but why not directly ?\r\n\r\nThe other direct benefits of having a \"simple\" CMake build system is we can undo the tight coupling of what should be the \"build\" with the source code. When developing, the sanitizers can be added and help ensure there is strong checks with proper memory usage and addressing etc.\r\n\r\n#### Proper sanitizing and bug catching \r\n\r\nFor instance, I found a buffer overflow in the tests within the ctaes library (inside crypto) which was found trivially after setting up a proper standalone CMake file for it. This was found within hours of me poking around and was there for a number of years. Makes one wonder how many other bugs are simple low hanging fruit, just waiting to be picked.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAccording to [The Developer Ecosystem in 2020: How C++ is Doing](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2020/06/dev-eco-cpp-2020/) , the C++ community is moving with conviction to CMake as their build system of choice. Over the last couple years its gone from 34% to 53% of developers choosing it over Makefiles or Visual Studio. If the trend continues, it is imperative the project invests in improving the current status quo.\r\n\r\nBegin adding CMake files to cover the major OSs Windows, OSX, Linux on the major processors x86_64. Then expand out to ARM and the smaller targets like Raspberry Pis and the like. Eschew the many optimizations and custom-tailored functions/modules for specific architectures and just add the generic standard library versions until the entire project builds and tests properly.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a \"monumental task\" as noted by @sipa , the hardest part will be decoupling of the many build steps with source code, but thats more tedious and repetitive than anything. \r\n\r\nI can and already have a couple CMake files for some modules like crypto and ctaes to start off. What I am not sure of exactly is the flow of direction between the libraries in the \"bitcoin-core\" project and this one. Which one follows which?\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> The current build system is very brittle and the custom tailored nature of it leaves the development team having to address constant breaking changes\r\n\r\nCan you point to some examples of it being very brittle, or the constant breaking changes? I'm not sure what you mean by custom tailored, unless you're talking about our depends system? However in that case, it's \"tailored\" to serve a specific purpose.\r\n\r\n> Improve ecosystem by having option to build shared libraries\r\n> if i wanted to instead wrap around the C++ code using CFFI and call directly from Python/JS/Whatever I am unable to as where would I even begin to get started on compiling a library as opposed to the executable in a neat manner\r\n\r\nThe current build system can and does build shared libraries. i.e libconsensus. There is a large amount of discussion related to libconsensus in this repository. There are also some PRs that demonstrate integration with other languages, including Rust.\r\n\r\n> When developing, the sanitizers can be added\r\n> Proper sanitizing and bug catching\r\n\r\nOur build system currently has support for debugging/sanitizers/fuzzers etc and they are run as part of our CI. We also have some getting started type documentation for new contributors, i.e https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md. Is there a particular feature or support for a tool that you think is missing?\r\n\r\n> For instance, I found a buffer overflow in the tests within the ctaes library (inside crypto)\r\n\r\nGreat. Have you reported this upstream anywhere? See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/SECURITY.md.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you're likely to get more interest if you actually present a branch with all the changes required, as they are going to be substantial, involve multiple sub projects, third-party libraries, compilers, build tools etc. For what it's worth I'm still Concept NACK.",

Where as most of the world does in fact use one and if the goal of bitcoin is to grow adoption then by definition, the metric here is to help these set of users. Please see any number of surveys to include the one linked above.\r\n\r\nI don't need help onboarding. I am pointing out the need to move the technology along. It seems clear CMake is what the industry has coalesced around, look at LLVM using it or INSERT_ANY_HIGH_TECH_PROJECT.  It is clear CMake isn't a fad and as such, given the massive gains to be had, should be something to work for.\r\n\r\nedit: added comment about surveys. insert company flag being escaped somehow",

It is about reducing maintenance costs and increasing portability with a properly setup build system.\r\n\r\nI noticed your comment about the CLion and how some documentation should be created to show how to use CLion with this project currently. Now that doc needs to be maintained and then another doc needs to be created for the future competitor of CLion in 5 years. Now you have at least 2 more docs to maintain besides the source code.\r\n\r\nOr just like updating the C++ standard used in this project, the build system could be updated.\r\n",

      "body": "@whb07 Realistically I think the only way you are going to get CMake usage to happen with bitcoin is to truly \"Decouple build system from source\" and create an independent \"bitcoin-cmake\" repository similar to https://github.com/bitcoin-core/packaging that houses cmake scripts and packaging separately from the sources. You could use gitsubmodules or subtrees to help with this or just make the CMake scripts flexible enough to build different versions of bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe people who actually devote time and effort to maintaining the bitcoin build system already have many issues to deal with and lots of work to do (supporting reproducible builds, packaging and signing, minimizing dependencies) and don't have a huge amount of experience with CMake. It would be unrealistic to expect them to learn how to use and maintain a CMake build.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have a lot of experience with CMake and think it's much nicer than autotools. But I don't maintain the bitcoin build system, and I am glad if the people who do maintain the build system use the tools they're most knowledgeable about.",

This isn't some \"fad\" its many years in the making, I've already noted that notable projects like LLVM are making use of it. I agree that a stable project like this one shouldn't chase after shiny new objects, but this isn't one. If you can follow that reddit poll of preferred build systems, it appears that Makefiles doesnt do \"as bad\", its because there weren't more options. CMake got nearly 4x what Makefiles did.\r\n\r\nNow there are times when a good idea/project are unknown and secret to most of the world, Bitcoin is one of them. Then there are the things everyone knows about and is fully valued, like Makefiles which are being replaced by a better product, like CMake or Meson and others.\r\n\r\n",

If `cmake`, or any other build tool, abstracted that away it's hard to see how it wouldn't be worth at least considering further, even if it's only as a supplementary tool rather than an `Autoconf` replacement.

But still falls short. I guess I wasn't very clear in the main post that easier onboarding and use of newer tools would be a positive side effect of implementing CMake. I didn't mean to say that this project should use CMake to have access to IDEs. Thats just a cherry on top.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of places where the code does some checking for X environment or Y library. Or you have python scripts and weird patches or whole directories like `compat` dedicated to custom tailor something to adjust for the infinite hardware /software combinations.\r\n\r\nMany of these scripts and whole modules can be done away with by having a more portable build system.",

Bitcoin is an example of a good outcome amongst the many dead failed attempts to create a decentralized money system. Had you said those exact words right up to the end of 2008/early 2009 you would have been 100% correct.\r\n\r\nI don't get the impression that you've a lot of experience working with this software, there is simply no value to attempting to use Bitcoin in this manor, there is no use case which comes close to justifying doing this. It has been tried before with Bitpay and their \"bitcore\" application, which resulted in people using tortured, ancient versions of Bitcoin with unsafe accesses through javascript peppered through it. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't really matter if you think that Bitcoin is revolutionary, exceptional, or standing on the ashes of other decentralized systems; it's simply not a good idea and results in people complaining when the interface they were calling is broken- even when it was never meant to be a public interface in the first place.
