This's my wallet address: muFjdWSy2DKStSP2gUH2aHZq6kRBva8ZDV it stated on the insight.bitpay.com. It stated confirmed. However, i can't send out to another wallet address as it stated insufficient funds. Please advise me what should i do? Is it a scam?\r\n\r\nMy transaction ID is b2898b8c5f5f01f573e768ec21fc4f15c1e433e7255960fb71551f06cec36651. It seems that my transaction confirmed. What should I do next? Iâ€™m stuck.",
