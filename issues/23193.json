    "body": "DNS seed node lookup ambiguous in some (rare) scenarios.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ RES_OPTIONS=\"options ndots:15\" LOCALDOMAIN=\"localtest.me\" src/bitcoind\r\n```\r\n\r\nContext from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22098#issuecomment-890227550:\r\n\r\n> It is outside of the scope of this PR but I think it would make sense to err on the safe side and specify all seed domain names with an ending dot to make them unambiguous.\r\n> \r\n> In other words …\r\n> \r\n> ```c++\r\n>     vSeeds.emplace_back(\"seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.\"); // Pieter Wuille, only supports x1, x5, x9, and xd\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> … instead of the current …\r\n> \r\n> ```c++\r\n>     vSeeds.emplace_back(\"seed.bitcoin.sipa.be\"); // Pieter Wuille, only supports x1, x5, x9, and xd\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> The former is guaranteed to be interpreted as `seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.` whereas the latter may be interpreted as say`seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.megacorp.com.` depending on the content of the user's `/etc/resolv.conf`.\r\n> \r\n> The case I'm thinking about is if `search megacorp.com` is specified in `/etc/resolv.conf` and say `options ndots:5` is used.\r\n> \r\n> Looking up `seed.bitcoin.sipa.be` would then result in the following DNS traffic:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> IP <src> > <resolver>.53: A? seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.megacorp.com.\r\n> IP <resolver>.53 > <src>: NXDomain\r\n> IP <src> > <resolver>.53: A? seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.\r\n> IP <resolver>.53 > <src>: Some valid response.\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> In other words `seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.megacorp.com.` would be tried before `seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.` :(\r\n\r\nI can think of three different approaches to fixing this:\r\n* Add a `bool allow_non_fqdn` argument to `Lookup*` functions, and automatically add a trailing `.` before passing the hostname string to `getaddrinfo` if `!allow_non_fqdn`. This approach would make the choice between FQDN vs \"potentially non-FQDN\" explicit. I think this is my preferred approach since the caller would explicitly signal his/her intent.\r\n* Specify seed node strings as FQDNs by appending `.` to the seed hostname strings in `src/chainparams.cpp`'s `vSeed`.\r\n* Change from `strprintf(\"x%x.%s\", requiredServiceBits, seed)` to `strprintf(\"x%x.%s.\", requiredServiceBits, seed)` when building the seed hostname in `CConnman::ThreadDNSAddressSeed()`.\r\n\r\nBackground: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22098#issuecomment-890227550 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22098#issuecomment-890582857 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22098#issuecomment-890763573",

Use of DNS servers as explained in https://voluntarymind.com/bitcoin/2021/\r\n2. One of the 9 domains getting hacked and pointing to malicious nodes for few hours\r\n3. DNS leaks if `onion` is used instead of `proxy`\r\n4. Few governments like to ask ISPs in their country to ban bitcoin related domains     \r\n\r\nSo I was thinking if we can use IPs instead of domains for bootstrapping.

In the example above a lookup for `seed.bitcoin.sipa.be` resulted in a query for `seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.localtest.me.`.\r\n\r\nThat's why I'm suggesting that we should err on the safe side and always pass FQDN to `getaddrinfo` for the seed nodes and in other similar contexts where the intention is to look up a FQDN (rather than a partially qualified domain name).\r\n\r\n> If you type google.com into your browser, for example, if google.com fails to resolve, it will try google.com.localtest.me\r\n\r\nIt seems like you've not tested the PoC above: `seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.localtest.me.` is tested _before_ `seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.`\r\n\r\n> Anyone who can control your DNS search domains, can most likely also MITM your DNS lookups[…]\r\n\r\nThis is a correctness issue.
