    "body": "There have been a couple of old attempts to enable parallel compact block downloads, see #9447 and #10984. There are additional notes in #16172.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that we currently might request missing transactions for a new block from the first peer to announce the block to us; but if that peer is a miner (or close to a miner), that peer might be busy (eg it might be in ConnectTip), and not able to reply quickly, while some other node has meanwhile obtained the block and is able to quickly give you the few transactions you're missing.\r\n\r\nTherefore, at some point we should pick up the patches in those earlier PRs, or otherwise solve this :)",

      "body": "This also seems to happen with spy(?) nodes which are the first to send a header, but then never end up responding to requests for the full block. Due to recent mempool chop, the chances of requiring a round-trip for slightly-later-but-behaving high bandwidth peer's cb goes way up, and currently cannot be accommodated.\r\n\r\ncouple of questions to think about:\r\n1) should the 2nd download only work for outbound connections? currently there are 3 hb peers possible, and only one outbound is \"protected\". Sybil nodes can take up 2 inbound slots pretty easily. Perhaps if first to announce is outbound, we allow an inbound as second as well?\r\n2) is 10 transaction diff as per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10984 reasonable with today's mempool characteristics?",
