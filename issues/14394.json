    "title": "Caller-initiated use of deprecatedrpc methods",
    "body": "As a bit of a follow-up to #14363  I think the deprecation of rpc functionality can be improved significantly.\r\n\r\nOne of the big problems with the way it is now, is that it's often undesirable to update client-software and bitcoin-core at the same time. Especially so when they're often maintained by different people/groups.\r\n\r\nThe deprecatedrpc is in a way a pretty intrusive way of just making sure the node operator knows that deprecated functionality is being used. I would suggest that this is generally the wrong \"party\" to be notifying anyway.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that in addition the rpc-client is the one that acknowledges it's using deprecated functionality. I'm not sure exactly how the implementation should work. But it could be done either connection-wide (an rpc-call to say which deprecated functionality it's using?), or as a flag to that specific call (acknowledge_deprecated=true).\r\n\r\n\r\nNow as a  bitcoin-client-software-author this makes a much smoother work flow. Let's say core 0.17 comes out and deprecates `signrawtransaction` in favor of `signrawtransactionwithwallet`. I can immediately update my software to acknowledge `signrawtransaction` is deprecated. Now it's immediately compatible with both 0.16 and 0.17.  Once enough of my users (or my only user in a more corporate setting) has fully upgraded to 0.17 and I no longer care about supporting 0.16, I can simply replace the call with the new `signrawtransactionwithwallet`. \r\n\r\nA change like this should be pretty uninvasive, and significantly make upgrades smoother for software using the rpc functionality.",

We could also update `bitcoin-cli` to read `-deprecatedrpc=<method>` command line and configuration options, and use them in requests.",

Why not just `acknowledge_deprecated=true` all the time?  \r\n\r\nIf I'd be a developer, I would prefer releasing software that doesn't break user software, even when if the user updates its underlying Core instance.  \r\n\r\nThus, I'd keep sending `acknowledge_deprecated=true` flag preemptively, even for calls I think would never be changed, just to be sure, because what is the downside? Nothing really.  \r\n\r\nIt must also be noted that the difference between `acknowledge_deprecated=true` and `-deprecatedrpc=<methodname>` is that, the developer may not want to (or can) mess up with `-deprecatedrpc=<methodname>` lines the config file for all rpc command it uses before the RPC would break. That just smells like a very dirty solution, compared to setting a simple flag true.  \r\n\r\nAnyhow, I'm not arguing for or against here, just giving some feedback on how the change would be used.",

It's also not easy to ask those users to upgrade, because when they upgrade it'll potentially break a bunch of other stuff they are doing. \r\n\r\nHonestly, the more I think about it, the more I think the current setup is over-engineered. I really think the best solution would be a sort of WARN_ONCE for deprecated methods, write to a deprecated.log . Then if people don't read the release notes (and previous warnings, or search the deprecated log) and get burnt upgrading -- then it's their problem. ",

      "body": "This is a shame. I thought the original request (allow deprecatedrpc to be passed as a JSONRPC argument) was a reasonable suggestion. I would suggest that if implemented, it should allow passing it as a JSONRPC argument *as well as* the option to specify it as a command-line argument. That way the deprecated RPC can be enabled either per-client or globally.\r\n\r\nSadly this thread has been hijacked for yet another \"freeze the public API forever\" rant.\r\n\r\n> Honestly, the more I think about it, the more I think the current setup is over-engineered. I really think the best solution would be a sort of WARN_ONCE for deprecated methods, write to a deprecated.log\r\n\r\n`deprecatedrpc` is a way to allow users to use both the old API and the new API in a single bitcoin core release. It gives users at least 6 months to update the client software to support the new API. I'm very happy to have the conversation about whether there's a more user-friendly way to support the old API, but both of your suggestions (per-client JSON RPC option and stateful tracking of whether a client has called a deprecated API) both require *more* engineering than a simple global toggle.\r\n\r\n> the better solution is removing the whole deprecated flags entirely\r\n\r\nIf you don't like the `deprecatedrpc` flag, then don't use it! You're going to have to upgrade your client to use the new API at some point (unless you chose to stay on an old version of Bitcoin Core forever). `deprecatedrpc` simply gives you one additional warning release before you have to upgrade your client.",
