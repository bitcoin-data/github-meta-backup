    "body": "Travis generally times out when `./depends` changes or when a commonly included header file is changed. It currently needs human attention to run the job again and continue compiling from the last time the cache was saved.\r\n\r\nSolutions to this could be:\r\n* Run a helper script to poll travis failures and rerun them if the failure was due to a timeout.\r\n* Rerun about-to-time-out jobs from within travis\r\n* Switch to another CI solution. We currently have travis, appveyor and (not enabled) Cirrus CI, so we'd have to get rid of at least one of them before adding a new one.",

Yep should be possible and afaik there are no limitations for either caching, matrices limitations\r\n\r\nTo put in a nutshell, I wouldn't see any blocker that would keep you away from doing the same things that are being done on TravisCI.

I understand doing these things wouldn't solve every problem, but it seems like they would solve most of the current problems with no downsides and not be too difficult to implement. The second option \"Rerun about-to-time-out jobs from within travis\" seems especially appealing and it looks like there's an existing implementation of it with curl here: https://github.com/plume-lib/trigger-travis#use-in-travisyml\r\n\r\nThe only potential downside I see is that logs from \"Error! Initial build successful, but not enough time remains...\" builds would be discarded, but since successful build logs probably aren't very interesting, this doesn't seem so important.\r\n\r\nI guess in the longer term, it does seem like we are pushing against travis limits and might need to find other solutions.",

Considering your builds now work with absolute paths, I just wanted to let you know that if you feel inclined to try with relative paths again, I'd be curious to see if you observe any issues. Thank you for your patience again and wishing you a great weekend.",

I think it is our moral responsibility to make sure we get the maximum value out of that donation. Given that we have a PM role then it seems like having someone with that role try to sort this thing out would be the prudent way of action. I fail to see why you object to that :)",

Ideally you should try them independently.\r\n\r\n1) Clear the content of the daemon.json config with a snippet similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbefore_install:\r\n  - echo '{\"registry-mirrors\":[\"https://mirror.gcr.io\"]}' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json\r\n  - sudo service docker restart\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now this file contains the following: {\"registry-mirrors\": [\"https://mirror.gcr.io\"], \"mtu\": 1460} and I'm wondering if the mtu setting could be at play.\r\n\r\n2) Change the archive.ubuntu.com URL with the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsed -i -e 's/http:\\/\\/archive\\.ubuntu\\.com/http\\:\\/\\/us-central1\\.gce\\.archive\\.ubuntu\\.com/' /etc/apt/sources.list\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease ensure to call this command before calling apt-get update.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps and please let us know the results you will get.\r\n\r\n----",
