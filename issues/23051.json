Glibc is simply not designed for it, and continuing this practice only increases the risk surface as the difference between supported build versions and intended runtime versions increases.\n\nI'd love to see a mechanism to keep doing this without hacks, but it simply does not exist. Every new glibc version that build OSes ship with means more work to add workarounds and wrappers. This is not a sustainable situation, and it is highly unconventional too: apparently the expected behavior is that when building against a certain glibc, you get a build that is compatible with the version you built with, and later, but not earlier.\n\nYou have two options:\n* Build using your own environment, and get a build compatible with your environment.\n* Build using the release build system (now guix based), which constructs a controlled environment designed to be compatible with all major distros.\n\nNothing is taken away, and nothing requires a dozen chroots.",

I see there are several levels of standalone executable.,\r\n\r\n- Standalone\r\n- Static\r\n- Self-contained\r\n- Portable\r\n- Universal\r\n\r\nAs it is, the codebase is universal as it is uncompiled (that is why PHP is better it is already universal - someone could interface it to [X11](http://www.linfo.org/x.html) and have a universal deployment, say creat a JAVA with its own --stdin --stdout --stderr set to operate on top of the desktop GUI, PHP doesn't have to interface to an HTTP engine. Use X it is better than JAVA everyone can have Linux - Bill does a great job but the market competition can press up...), and I can think of the reasons even then why a build system for release might be private as long as it could be trusted. I will try GUIX and see if I can at least get up to portable. I have GitLab now privately so I can clone on the Fedora 28 system and try and build at lease self-contained there probably. It beats pushing everything to the public on GitHub as useful as it is.",
