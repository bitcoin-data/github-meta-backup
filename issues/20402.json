    "title": "Invalid integer negation in FormatMoney(CAmount n) and ValueFromAmount (CAmount n) when n = std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::min()",
    "body": "`FormatMoney(CAmount n)` is not being properly defined for `n = std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::min()`. This is due to an invalid integer negation: the negation of `-9223372036854775808` cannot be represented in type `CAmount` (which has a max value of `9223372036854775807`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/54f812d9d29893c690ae06b84aaeab128186aa36/src/util/moneystr.cpp#L12-L31\r\n\r\nFWIW `FormatMoney(-9223372036854775808)` returns `--92233720368.-54775808` when compiled with UBSan (LLVM/Clang, `-fsanitize=undefined`).\r\n\r\nContext: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20383#discussion_r523250890\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if `FormatMoney(CAmount n)` was properly defined for all `CAmount n` :)\r\n\r\nThese are the \"expectations of least surprise\":\r\n\r\n```\r\nBOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(FormatMoney(std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::max()), \"92233720368.54775807\");       //  9223372036854775807\r\nBOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(FormatMoney(std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::max() - 1), \"92233720368.54775806\");   //  9223372036854775806\r\nBOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(FormatMoney(std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::max() - 2), \"92233720368.54775805\");   //  9223372036854775805\r\nBOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(FormatMoney(std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::max() - 3), \"92233720368.54775804\");   //  9223372036854775804\r\nBOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(FormatMoney(std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::min() + 3), \"-92233720368.54775805\");  // -9223372036854775805\r\nBOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(FormatMoney(std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::min() + 2), \"-92233720368.54775806\");  // -9223372036854775806\r\nBOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(FormatMoney(std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::min() + 1), \"-92233720368.54775807\");  // -9223372036854775807\r\nBOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(FormatMoney(std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::min()), \"-92233720368.54775808\");      // -9223372036854775808\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese assertions are _guaranteed_ to hold for all cases above _except_ for the last one.",
