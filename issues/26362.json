    "title": "signed overflow in coinstats index",
    "body": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6d4048468430d9d1fe5e7c5fcda13708879d1083/src/index/coinstatsindex.h#L33-L35\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6d4048468430d9d1fe5e7c5fcda13708879d1083/src/kernel/coinstats.h#L54-L59\r\n\r\nThe values:\r\n\r\n * `m_total_prevout_spent_amount`\r\n * `m_total_new_outputs_ex_coinbase_amount`\r\n * `m_total_coinbase_amount`\r\n\r\nare all subject to overflowing an `int64_t` (ie, `CAmount`). This is visible in practice as of signet block 112516; with     `total_prevout_spent` rolling over to -92230771076.81494784 (from from 92232270378.54920553 BTC at block 112515). With debug builds, this will cause a crash due to the `-ftrapv` compiler option.\r\n\r\nMaking these just be per-block totals instead of cumulative totals should fix this in practice. I think that would require a full index rebuild, though?\r\n\r\nEven then I think it would still be technically possible to overflow `m_block_prevout_spent_amount` or `m_total_new_outputs_ex_coinbase_amount` with a single block: you can fit over 15,000 65-byte transactions spending to `padding DROP TRUE` in a block, and if you start with a utxo containing 6.15M BTC and chain it through 15,000 txs, then that will overflow a signed 64 bit counter. That's not reproducible on regtest, though, since the halving schedule there limits the total supply to ~15,000 regtest-BTC, which means you need about 6.15M transactions to trigger the same overflow.\r\n\r\nSince we don't actually expose the cumulative totals; I observed the values above by patching gettxoutsetinfo in rpc/blockchain to add:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n/*line ~877*/    {RPCResult::Type::STR_AMOUNT, \"total_prevout_spent\", \"Total amount of all prevouts spent up to this block\"},\r\n/*line ~981*/    block_info.pushKV(\"total_prevout_spent\", ValueFromAmount(stats.total_prevout_spent_amount));\r\n```",

The reason to use them rather than the per block values, was some of the following review feedback:\r\n- Cumulative seems to be easier to use downstream https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19521#issuecomment-677958519\r\n- It's easier to go from cumulative to per-block rather than the other way around https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19521#issuecomment-680409442\r\n\r\nI haven't gotten much feedback on use of the index lately and the use of the cumulative numbers was only in combination with not-yet-merged #19792 so I think removing the cumulative numbers should not be causing too many complaints. Pinging @PierreRochard \r\n\r\n> Is it important to report this number? Why not remove it from the RPC result?\r\n\r\nIIRC users that were interested in auditing the coin supply in detail were very interested in this, so I would much rather like to fix it than remove it.\r\n\r\n> I can't think of a way to fix this without a breaking change to the index.\r\n\r\nMe neither as of now but I had some ideas on \"gracefully\" upgrading indices because there were so many ideas floating around for coinstatsindex two years ago.

I think the interesting identities are `sum(coinbase-fees) + sum(unclaimed) = sum(subsidy) = spendable + unspendable` and each of those values and each of the sums are bounded by `MAX_MONEY` (though `sum(coinbase)` and `sum(fees)` independently would be unbounded).\r\n\r\nNote that `total_out` in `getblockstats` has the same edge-case.

      "body": "I have a [draft](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26426) for changing the cumulative values to be per block. So far I have not gotten any feedback but I think this should be ok to change as the feedback in the original PR that I linked above has not making it sound like a hard requirement to have cumulative values. I will clean up the PR and test it more thoroughly in the next couple of days but I tested it on signet already and should fix the issue there.\r\n\r\nFor the approach to upgrade: my current thinking is that it is probably best to build the new version of the index in a new folder and give the user a notice in the logs that they can delete the old index folder. While many users may have this useless data on their disk for a while because they ignore the logs, it seems like the cleanest approach to me. Of course the old index folder can also be deleted automatically but I am not sure this is desirable. I am thinking of users that may jump between different versions of core, maybe the latest release and master. When switching between versions before and after the upgrade, this approach should produce the least side effects. Worst case I think they delete the old index after the reading of the log message but then when they switch back to an older version they see the old index being rebuilt. But if the new index is built in the same folder, it would be much worse and the index would be corrupted leading to very confusing issues for these users. I am sure something could be done to mitigate that but it seems like much more complex solution that is not absolutely necessary. \r\n\r\nHappy to hear your feedback, especially on the approach to upgrade!",
