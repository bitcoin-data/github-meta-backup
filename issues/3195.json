Then again, having \"block\" mean \"I'm 100% sure this block and all of its transactions are okey dokey\" and another message meaning something slightly different might be best.\n",

It didn't yield improved propagation because of other single threading in the network handling code.\n\nSome thought is required here.

      "body": "Relaying blocks before checking their transactions would negatively impact miner incentives.\n\nMiners have strong incentives to minimize orphan rates of their blocks. Orphan rates are a function of block propagation time. Block propagation time is heavily impacted by how many signatures in the block need to be computed upon block receipt, as opposed to being cached when the transactions were received individually.\n\nThis means that miners are currently incentivized to disperse to the network as quickly and widely as possible not just the blocks they mine, but also the transactions contained in blocks their hashpower is attempting to mine -- which not only encourages transaction propagation, but _preferentially_ encourages the propagation of the transactions most likely to be included in upcoming blocks.\n\nRemoving the effect of ahead-of-block transaction relay on miners' expected returns would eliminate their incentive to use their relay networks to push to the network any transactions. This is an incentive that I believe currently plays an active role in the network: I've been running my node with extra logging for a while that displays how many of the transactions in a received block were already known, and found that some of the time 100% of non-coinbase transactions have already been validated, while the average is much lower (typically ~70%). I think the most likely reason for this higher cluster would be that some miners ensure that transactions they're working on are relayed to the network as broadly as possible, while others do not have expansive relay networks or ill-advisedly use their relay networks only to push blocks.\n\nUnfortunately this mechanism does currently disincentivize miners from including in blocks non-standard transactions, since their signatures will typically be verified only once they are received in a block. However, this can be addressed without eliminating miners' incentives to broadcast transactions: one approach would be a network message for \"shares\", runt blocks that meet a difficulty criterion some fixed proportion of the network's actual requirement, that could be used to prove to nodes that work on a block containing certain transactions is underway and (like merkleblock) provide a subset of the contained transactions (incentives dictate that miners would typically include only the non-standard transactions), allowing nodes to verify in advance transactions they would not otherwise process or forward.\n",

      "body": "Miners currently have an an incentive to relay transactions they include in blocks but It's more the reverse way: they have an incentive to include transactions already relayed by the network and already in other miners pools. \nSo relaying headers is optimal, as long as the transactions included are known.\nMining on empty headers is also fine, as long as the miner rolls-back to whatever block was mining before if after some time (e.g. 10 seconds) the transactions are not received and verified. The maximum empty mining time is accumulated for successive blocks (if a miner doesn't have transactions for the last 2 blocks, then he waits only 10 seconds before rolling-back, not 20 seconds, to prevent creating an infinite long empty branch).\n\nPublishing a header but withholding transactions becomes a bad strategy.\nThe only drawback is that a block mined on top of an unverified header must em empty (apart from the coinbase or self-transactions), and this requires the subsidy to be non-zero to incentivize this mining) \nSo the header-first strategy with immediate mining will work for, probably, 15 years.\nThere will be plenty of time to think of a better strategy then.\nAs an additional measure, the header can be marked with a bit in the nVersion field if it is empty, to allow miners so start mining non-empty blocks when an empty header is received.\n\nA little more info I posted here: http://bitslog.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/5-sec-block-interval/\nbut not much that has not already been said.\n",

As long as that miner is the only one who know the full block, he is also the only one who can mine additional blocks with transactions, and thus the only one who can collect transaction fees. So the proposed timeout would lead to a situation in which the full block is withheld until just before the timeout, which is not something we would want.\n\n-> IMHO, this issue can be closed.\n",

      "body": "@SergioDemianLerner That's what I thought first too. However, once you try to define a clear and concise rule about when to accept a block and when not, things turn ugly. For example, what if the block transmission hits the timeout with 20% of the nodes, but is ok with the majority? When should you re-accept a block you previously dismissed due to reaching the timeout? Whenever you try to fix one issue, a few new ones emerge. This is typically a symptom of trying to do something that does not fit the spirit of the system - on our case accepting a block without having seen it. And even if you come up with watertight rules for when a block should be accepted, it will be extremely hard to prove that the rules actually are watertight.\n",

      "body": "Think about this: a miner A that withhold the block data (but not the header) does not get any direct additional income. Only if another miner B finds a block within the 10 second window and the block has no transactions because the block transactions were never received by X, then A could take those transaction fees if he is lucky enough to mine the next block, and assuming the remaining existent transactions in the pool do not provide equal profit. But if the block is saturated the remaining transactions, on average, should have approximately the same amount of fees. So nothing is gained.\n\nAs an example, assuming the current state of Bitcoin. Let $ 40 (USD) be the average tx fees per block. Let the probability of a collision in a 10 seconds windows be 1.6%. if miner A has 20 % of the hashing rate, and 1 every two blocks has transaction fees which are 50% higher than the next block fees, then A would get an average of  40/2/5= 4 (USD) of additional income per block by not relying txs  on a collision, which happens 1.6% of the times. Or an average of 6 cents per block. Or a total of $ 57 (USD) more per month over 54 MILLION USD earned. Not very significant.\n\nAnd this is what Microsoft \"Bitcoin and Red Balloons\" discovered two years ago. That Miners withholding transactions could get some advantage in a purely theoretical setup (or in a distant future, when subsidy is near zero), but in practice no miner is withholding transactions today, and no miner will do it for the next 15 years, if Bitcoin succeeds. \n\nThis is true while the subsidy is high. In 20 years, when Bitcoin is the world most valuable currency, but there is no subsidy and only tx fees matter, miners will voluntarily turn off this feature. No big deal.\n\nAnd there there are other reasons why miners won't invest in gambling this aspect of the system. Think about the current network state. Why aren't all miners using TheBlueMatt high speed relay system? Why haven't they implemented a system to relay blocks without sending all the already known transactions? Why aren't they creating blocks without transactions and saving 100 $ in every block? \n\nBecause Miners generally follow the rules. They are conservative. They don't seem to want to maximize their short-term profit to the extend to destroying Bitcoin. So miner's won't rewrite their mining software to increase their profit in 6 cents per block (the additional mining fees they could get, if they manage not to risk 10K USD by doing it).\n\nAt any time a miner that doesn't think this is good for him can stop mining on headers, but if the majority of the remaining miners still do it, he will be loosing a lot of money. A miner switching off this feature today would loose 1.6% of every block mined on average (aprox. 200 USD).\n\nAnd about the spirit of Bitcoin. I don't know which this spirit is, but (IMHO) the spirit of Bitcoin Mining is this: every miner wants his block to be accepted by the network as much as possible. Sooner or later miners will exchange block headers before block transaction-data, wether using the Bitcoin network or using a private backbone. We won't be able to stop this.\n",

      "body": "@Sjors Depends on what you mean by \"this\".  If a peer explicitly requests it you'll forward blocks to them that meet a subset of block validity requirements, but not otherwise, and they'll only ban you if the block is invalid in that subset you were supposed to still have checked.  The subset includes hash tree consistency, so you're required to have access to all the data for the block: you won't relay a block where you don't know enough to check if it was valid or not.  This avoids the above discussed attacks where block payload is withheld, the fact that the behaviour has to be requested avoids the problem of sending invalid data to clients that expected us to validate for them.",
