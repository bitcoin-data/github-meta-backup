Next the (exchange?) wallet user would have to initiate transactions **without** setting conf target or feerate manually, which also seems unlikely to me, in order to be taken advantage of.\r\n\r\nThe payoff (if the attack is not simply a grief) requires having significant-enough hashpower to then collect the fees from those transactions by winning the next block.\r\n\r\nIf the sender specifies either conf target or feerate as part of the call then these override the the value of `m_pay_tx_fee`. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the `wallet.m_pay_tx_fee` member variable seems unlikely to ever be converted to a persistent wallet database entry which would end up being encrypted by the wallet passphrase, as OP suggests could protect against this.\r\n",
