    "body": "I'd very much appreciate the (RPC) command getrawtransaction to work on a pruned node. When I browse the rawmempool or the last X blocks, I'd love to be able to find out about what's gone on in these blocks. \r\n\r\nI have not tried pruning my node to test getrawtransaction but I've read that the txindex (needed for getrawtransaction) is incompatible with getrawtransaction. Why? \r\n\r\nLogically speaking I'd think I could browse and decode the X blocks (and transactions) that I do have stored. And if the block or transaction is not in my local database, could it not tell me something like: \"this block does either not exist or it is not in your pruned version of the database\"\r\n\r\nMaybe there can be a prunedtxindex option or perhaps txindex can be made compatible with the pruned option. \r\n\r\nPlease tell me if this is technically possible or if it is not (if say old blocks need to be queried to decode a raw transaction)",

I believe this functionality is deprecated though.\r\n\r\nThe point of pruning is to throw away transactions that are no longer needed, and the point of txindex is to be able to search for old transactions by their transaction id. I'm not entirely sure these concepts are very compatible.\r\n\r\nI guess it would be theoretically possible to have a txindex for all transactions that aren't pruned, but this seems a little weird. \r\n",

      "body": "A pruned node currently has no way of knowing if a transaction hash doesn't exist or did exist but got pruned.\r\n\r\nMaybe a pruned node can use some bloom-filter like data structure to hold on to the full set of pruned transaction ids? That way `getrawtransaction` can return a clear error message and state with confidence that a given transaction doesn't exist (false positives don't really matter in this scenario).\r\n\r\nAlternatively - easier - `getrawtransaction` would take a `since` argument, required for pruned nodes, and throw an error if `since` is lower than the prune depth.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion is separate from the issue that `-txindex=1` currently doesn't work with pruned nodes.",
