    "body": "This is proposal in reaction to current Bitfinex hack. It has similar pattern as previous BitStamp hack. The most damages are made by other parties sending their bitcoins to the compromised addresses after hack has been discovered and confirmed. This proposal introduces new message being broadcast through the network with list of addresses to put on a blacklist\n\nBlacklist means:\n- any client refuses to public transaction containing blacklisted address\n- miners reject a transaction containing blacklisted address\n\nTo put address on the blacklist requires to have the private key. Every address on the list must contain correct signature and expiration of the blocking.\n\n(sorry for english)\n",

      "body": "@luke-jr  It seems that u don't want to understand. Address reuse is not only issue for this case. This address https://blockchain.info/address/1Ks4usdNXE4Un97pYG5Aqrjx3tm88GVj9n was not reused and still the sender lost 1 Bitcoin. My idea is mitigate the damage made by the attack. Yes, Bitfinex can state, that any transfers made after announcement will not refunded. But Bitfinex cannot do this, because many transfers was made to addresses generated by the Bitfinex and user is not obliged to be always online. Bitfinex will have to refund this loss, so this still increases the damage.\n\nThe idea doesn't require any special change in the Bitcoin protocol. We can use OP_RETURN and put the blocking request after it. This idea will work only if majority of bitcoin users will accept it. \n\nI know, that there are some possible ways, how to abuse this feature - as someone pointed out that it can be used to block unconfirmed transactions. But there is already way to block unconfirmed transaction. Someone can try to double-spend the transaction with the same effect. It still doesn't render the idea invalid. We can just put this feature at the same level as double-spending and problem is solved.\n\nI just drew the idea. You should to improve the idea, not finding the difficulties to throw it away. Bitcoin needs lot of user-protecting features and this is one of them. Otherwise, it will not widely accepted by the public.\n",

      "body": "Ondra, Petr: lets imagine, it is done in the bitcoin somehow. It must be stored somewhere (where?). And now imagine someone else being an attacker and wanting to DoS the network. So they will start at private key 1 and start network flooding... This particular problem can be partially solved by the fee on these _lock_ translations (if the lock is being done as a transaction of some special kind). And there are other problems I can think of - do you see them? Do you have a solution for them?\n\nBut anyway, this is not a solution for offline signing, SPV clients etc.\n\nIt is not about incompetence, but about the visionary - people here see a bit more than you. In this case much more than you. People here are not obliged to finish your ideas. If you want something to happen, just work on it, create proposal, send it to the development list for discussion etc.\n\nIn this particular case, the whole principle of \"deposit to some address\" needs to be reworked from the exchanges side IMO.\n",

      "body": "1) Indeed, if you make it a consensus rule, that problem is solved.\nHowever, doing such a softfork requires a majority of hashpower to agree\nwith your change, which is potentially uneconomical for them. It still\nrequires wallets to deal with non-confirming transactions to such\naddresses, and it's much more fundamentally solved by informing the sender\nnot to create such a transaction in the first place.\n\n2) Ok.\n\n3) As per 1), you're now making it a consensus rule, requiring it to be\nstored by all full nodes in a fast lookup table  using potentially\nunbounded fast memory as well, in addition to the UTXO set.\n\n4) That's one way to implement the soft fork, but now you're not only\nchanging the P2P protocol, but also the network consensus rules, so you\nwill absolutely need to take this discussion to a larger audience than one\nclient. I understand you're just trying to convince people that a problem\nexists and must be solved (by others), but for this kind of problem, this\nis really not the place.\n\n5) I'm not suggesting to outlaw send to address entirely, those have their\nuses, but for the vast majority of your use cases, you already have the\nreceiver online anyway. And ultimately, this _is_ just about informing\nsenders to not send somewhere (either by broadcast messages, by asking a\nfull node through P2P, or by seeing their transactions not confirm in\ntime). It is vastly more efficient to just tell them, than imposing the\ncost of distributing and maintaining a blacklist by every full node in the\nnetwork. Furthermore, negotiating transactions as done by BIP70 also has\nother advantages (such as being able to identify receivers, communicating\nrefund addresses, sending memo messages, and better privacy through\nreducing address reuse).\n\nIf you don't want to write a BIP or at least start discussing the perceived\nproblem on the mailing list, that's fine, but don't expect the contributors\nto one client to start advocating your proposed solutions to others.\n",

There are, indeed, no fungibility issues with disallowing spends _to_ an address.\n\nYour proposal is would be best implemented as a recipient address blacklist coordinated between wallets. This could have some use, whether the coordination happens over the P2P protocol or not. But take the discussion to the mailing list, this is not the right place for high-level proposals.\n(also - my suggestion would be to use another term than 'blacklist', as you've noticed it can cause almost aggressive reflex reactions)\n",
