    "body": "```\nProblem: Bitcoin-QT crash when importing a private key.\n\nBug report.\n\nBitcoin-QT version 0.8.1\nWindows version:  Windows 7 professional 32-bit\nBlock-chain not downloaded completely - about 7K blocks left.\n\nAction that cause the issue:\n\nHelp -> Debug window -> Console\n\nWrite help to get info about commands.\n\nthen\n\n\nimportprivkey privatekeyhere labelhere\n\nor\n\nimportprivkey privatekeyhere\n\nboth makes the Debug window unresponsive when clicking it after the commands have finished. After clicking the X in the far right corner, windows says the program is non-responsive and asks if it should be shut down. I've tried waiting for a long time (several minutes) to see if it resolved itself, it didn't.\n\nHowever after forcing a closedown of the program through the windows close down feature, and restarting the bitcoin client, the address appears to have been imported just fine. I haven't tried to send or receive any coins with the imported adresses yet. But I assume that would work.\n\nWhen bitcoin-QT starts again, it takes a while and gives a message about verifying the block database integrity or something like that, I didn't note down exactly what it said.\n```\n\nCould the reason be that the client is rescanning ? I didn't ask it to rescan.\n",

My entire purpose is to create a new public address for each transaction the same way mt gox appears to do each time I deposit btc into my account.  If the key system is any type of modulus system is it not true that a single private key could have many public solutions?  If that is the case... how to I create a batch new public keys from the \"original\" private key within or outside my wallet?  I would like to create:\n\n1publicaddress12345\n1sumutherpublicaddress12345\n1sumutherpublicaddress12346\n1sumutherpublicaddress12347\n\nI expected these to show up under \"Receive\" so I'm now thinking that I wanted to create new public addresses from the existing key instead of new keys which _seem to be called_ addresses.  Is this right?\n\nMy solution _was_ to use vanitygen + import the newly pressed keys.  But I don't think I want/need all the private keys.  Thoughts? Better place to ask? (I don't need vanity addresses, just unique ones with a zero balance).\n",
