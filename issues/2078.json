    "body": "I just learned about bitcoins and think it is one of the most important ideas out there.\n\nHowever, after watching a youtube video where gavinandresen addresses a C.I.A. owned trust fund, I realized that many entities like banks and government agencies are probably stashing themselves with bitcoins in order to control the market by owning a huge chunk of it. \n\nTo avoid a possibly unhealthy accumulation of wealth by parties that don't care about things like the common good, it would be beneficial to come up with a system where although the transactions remain anonymous, there exist incentives for the nodes whose transactions result in the most positive effect to the whole market. \n\nIn other words, each node or bitcoin wallet address should have some sort of a reputation given by the effect that its transaction history has had on the other nodes procurement capacity. \n\nDoes anyone else thinks this is a legitimate concern?\n",

Like Satoshi did. Even \"bad\" implementation win over \"good\" ideas because they can actually be adapted and improved over time. Good luck.\n\n I'm closing this issue because it is not technical issue.\n",
