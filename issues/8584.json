For example, if a node makes a SegWit transaction and for some reason the miners choose to allow spending from a SegWit transaction then the funds could be intercepted.\n\nWhat safeguard or guarantees are in place to reassure users that SegWit transactions will be treated as such by all miners BEFORE they are created? Is it just a case of letting everyone test the water first with small transactions and letting enough time go by to see that miners are making it safe to create them?\n",
