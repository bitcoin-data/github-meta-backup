    "title": "Plumb \"too-long-mempool-chain\" to RPC error for send/sendtoaddress",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIf coin selection fails as part of `send` or `sendtoaddress`, the error message returned to the RPC client is `Insufficient funds`, even if the actual cause is due to `too-long-mempool-chain`.  This is likely to alarm users unnecessarily, as they will believe this means their funds have permanently vanished rather than being temporarily inaccessible.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIf coin selection fails due to `too-long-mempool-chain`, the `send` and `sendtoaddress` methods should pass that error back to the RPC client, instead of `Insufficient funds`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nIt would be even nicer from a UX standpoint if the limit on mempool chain length were removed, but AIUI [that's a DoS vector](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9752#issuecomment-281464014), so is not going to happen.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nApparently this is [already done for `sendrawtransaction`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10015#issuecomment-288597075).  The discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10015 is relevant (it appears that the PR was withdrawn for reasons unrelated to my request).\r\n",

The status quo is confusing to nontechnical users (source: personal experience providing tech support to users who think their funds have been stolen after seeing the \"Insufficient funds\" error code).\r\n\r\nFWIW I agree with @achow101 in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24502#issuecomment-1061742337 : \r\n\r\n> I think \"insufficient funds\" is too generic of an error message for coin selection failures as there are a ton of different reasons why coin selection might fail. I would like to have more granular error messages\r\n",

These funds will become available when the transaction confirms\" or something.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'm not saying I'm against more specific error messages. I'm saying that, since the user was not responsible for creating the transaction in the first place, it seems unhelpful to tell them the transaction was too-long-mempool-chain, as they can't do anything differently to change this. The information that would be helpful to them is \"you have money, but it's in unconfirmed UTXOs and I can't create a valid transaction right now.\"",
