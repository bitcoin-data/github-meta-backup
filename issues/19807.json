I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\nSetting a lower-than-current prune height via `pruneblockchain` currently requires a full resync. On slower machines, this can take a very long time. It is also unnecessary.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nSince all block headers are retained for PoW and chain reorg purposes, bitcoind could feasibly re-download the raw blocks that are lower than the *old* cursor, and above the *new* cursor, and check their validity against the retained headers.\r\n",

      "body": "Downloading arbitrary blocks is certainly possible (this is how neutrino clients work) however, downloading old blocks would not include their UNDO data. This means you might be able to download old blocks to (for example) rescan a wallet but you would not be able to handle a deeper chain reorg than the original prune depth.\r\n\r\nWhat might be possible is to increase the prune depth by 1 with every new incoming block, until a new desired prune depth is reached. The mechanism there would be to simply NOT delete the oldest block from disk until the new prune depth is reached. This would require no extra historical block downloads or weird half-validation.\r\n\r\nWould that be sufficient for you use-case, @ProofOfKeags ?",

If you prune to height N, and you install a different service that wants height N-M, the only solution is to do a full resync and download all the way back to N-N (aka 0). When M is small, this is needlessly expensive.\r\n\r\nIt is probably a rare use case, these days as many bitcoiners are now opting for full archive nodes or ditching running a node altogether, making pruning of any kind a declining use case at this point. I certainly wouldn't contest closing it. I think it was more of an artifact of the time when it was opened, and pruning was more necessary for home node viability.",
