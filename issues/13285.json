    "title": "tests: Automatically order regtests by runtime",
    "body": "Bitcoin's regtests are ordered roughly by runtime (longest running first) to aid in parallelism in `test/functional/test_runner.py`.  This makes sense, but having the manually-ordered list in the script has two issues:\r\n\r\n1. It is brittle and error prone, as whoever adds a new test has to judge where to put it.  Also, when a test is changed in a way that affects the runtime, it is likely forgotten to reoder the list.\r\n\r\n1. Having the list in a weird order makes it much less readable.  In code, it should be ordered in a way that is logical for developers to write and read, with related tests next to each other.\r\n\r\nI would like to make the ordering automatic.  For this, we can just have a new data file (e. g., JSON or generated Python code) that has the runtime for each test, and then use this file to sort the list automatically before running any tests.  This file should probably be checked into version control, but `test_runner.py` can have a new execution mode that not only prints the runtimes after the fact (which it already does) but also saves them to this file.  That way, it will be easy to keep it updated, and no manual judging is required.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think about this proposal - I would like to get feedback before I implement it, so that I can take that feedback into account and not waste my time.",

      "body": "Yes, that's certainly possible.  The disadvantage I see is that it still means we have to manually specify the runtime, and cannot generate it automatically.  But I think that's a minor drawback, and not having another list of tests (even if autogenerated) may well outweigh it.  This certainly solves the main issue I'm interested in, which is the manual ordering in the list.\r\n\r\nI currently don't have time (nor do I want to step on your toes here) to implement the full set of metadata mentioned in #11964, though.  So I would only include the rough runtime in the tests to make the order automatic (i. e., the order in `test_runner.py` itself won't matter and can be based on logical relation of tests rather than runtime).  I would not implement the full set of metadata to get rid of the list completely for now.  Do you still think that's worthwhile for now, or do you just want to implement the full solution yourself instead?",

      "body": "Thanks everyone for the input, that's exactly why I opened this issue before working on the actual code!\r\n\r\n@jnewbery: I fully agree that just the \"automatic ordering\" aspect is likely not too important in itself, and that having an auto-generated order might be overengineering.  However, as far as I can see your comment relates only to point 1) of my original report.  I believe that point 2) is actually the important part (perhaps that was not made very clear):  **I want to get rid of the requirement to have tests in order in the code, at least roughly.**  Instead, the code should be mainly written for us developers, and should be in an order that makes sense from a logical point of view.\r\n\r\nSo if you (and others) believe that solving point 1) in addition is not worth the complication of the auto-generated list, my proposal is to solve just point 2) by manually including (approximate) test runtimes somewhere - for instance, by a limited implementation of metadata in tests as suggested by #11964 (where the metadata is for now just the test runtime, so that `test_runners.py` can sort on the fly before running the tests).  What do you think about this proposal?",

I want to get rid of the constraint that it has to be sorted, and thus allow reordering it in a more readable and logical way.

I don't think we need to worry about reordering them more than once a year.\r\n\r\nIf I understand this correctly, sounds like the minimum, IMO, that can be done is:\r\n\r\n - Pull the `BASE_SCRIPTS` and `EXTENDED_SCRIPTS` into another file (simple JSON file(s)) keeping their current order.\r\n - Then when running `test_runner.py` with a new flag (e.g. track_time), we have logic that will keep track of the time it takes to run each test and keep the order in a list in memory.\r\n - Then take that list in memory and write the list order to these new JSON file(s).\r\n - Then if there are changes to that JSON, changes will show in `git` and the developer can choose whether to commit the new ordering or not.",

      "body": "Let me perhaps explain how I came to this idea:  I'm the core maintainer of Namecoin, which is based on Bitcoin Core and tries to follow the upstream development as closely as possible.  We do have our own set of regression tests, in addition to the ones Bitcoin has.  I most certainly want to have all of them in a single block in `test_runner.py`, currently at the end (definitely not mixed into the Bitcoin tests, for various reasons from merge conflicts to clarity in reading the code).  This means that the tests take longer than they need to, because our longer running tests are not parallelised well.\r\n\r\nOf course, that's by itself not a valid reason to change anything in Bitcoin.  First, that's Namecoin's problem and not Bitcoin's.  And second, we can solve the issue quite easily by moving the block of tests to the beginning rather than end of the test list.\r\n\r\nHowever, since in my opinion it clearly makes sense to have the \"name-related\" tests in Namecoin in their own block rather than mixed into all other tests, I assume that the same argument can be made also for Bitcoin's tests.  I'm not strictly thinking about a lexicographical order; perhaps having all \"segwit-related\" tests next to each other would make sense, or all P2P tests (the latter is close to lexicographic ordering now with the naming convention).\r\n\r\nBut if you disagree and don't see value in doing this for Bitcoin, I can understand that we should not introduce more complexity \"for nothing\" - then I'm perfectly happy to close this issue as \"won't fix\", and just put Namecoin's tests at the beginning of the list.  But ideally I would like to know before coding it up whether or not such a change would be accepted (not considering the actual code quality for now, of course).",
