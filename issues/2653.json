    "body": "I have just finished the most frightening and stressful meetings in my life.\n\nTo avoid boring you with a long story of tears this is it in short:\n\nSome nasty person-- **NOT ME**-- used bitcoin to pay for some very nasty business.\n\nMy home was **INCORRECTLY** displayed as the source of these transactions on blockchain.\n\nBecause of this law enforcement believe I was guilty and took me and my computers.\nIn result I have been violated in body and mind.\n\nIt was very hard to say them that the data stored in the blockchain was\nnot valid. This is doing to all the discussion about how reliable and tamper proof\nit is. I was believed only after finding my computer free of any indication.\n\nIf my computer is for my interest it would not permit connection to blockchain!!!!\nConnecting to this treacherous thing does me no benefit!\n\nI know others can connect and false claim my address but they should be\nstopped too and can be when they make those words public. The problem is\nmaking of it public because then ignorant people will see and accuse!\n\nIf you fear shutting down the service you should not because it is\nbad and causes great harm to people. But if you must protect it then\nmake the blocking only active if the software has made transactions\nthen blockchain can stay connected but only via wallets with no\ntransactions which can easily be seen to have no indication.\n",

      "body": "Wow, that's nasty.\n\nThat would make a very good argument to encourage people to make sure their Bitcoin client is shut down when they're not actively using it, even if it means that it will take longer to sync up when needed next time.  This probably isn't in the best interests of the Bitcoin protocol, since it benefits from large numbers of nodes remaining online, to provide stability and scalability.\n\nHas such a thing happened in court before, if not from Bitcoin, then from another similar peer-to-peer protocol?  If something illegal is relayed through you, without your knowledge, and the audit trail ends at you and can't be traced back further, then, are you legally then responsible for it?  If so, that would be a rather chilling effect for many other network services, not just Bitcoin.  Are you in the USA?  If so, that's very unfortunate, our legal/political climate is not the most welcoming to users of new/disruptive technologies....\n\nThe blockchain.info service is merely a collector of information that's flowing across the Bitcoin network, and while it doesn't connect to all nodes, it connects to many of them.  Probably the criminal transaction happened at a node that was near to you, but not connected to blockchain.info, and it propagated throughout the Bitcoin network, and your node happened to have the bad luck of being the first node visible to blockchain.info that the transaction passed through, so it looked like it was originated by you.  Anybody could gather this information and set up a similar website to blockchain.info, there's nothing unique to them (although they are very good at what they do), so blocking just this one site wouldn't do anything to help.\n\nWhat was the outcome of this, did you get help, did you find a competent lawyer?\n",

      "body": "qubez: GREAT idea, I like the wording of that phrase, I hope blockchain.info sees it and can apply it.  Have you told them?\n\nPerhaps this might help address this issue.  For each incoming transaction that is received for the first time, log the IPv4 address/port (or equivalent for other protocols), along with a timestamp, for that TXID.  Keep this log indefinitely.  The idea would be to be able to provide an audit trail, upon demand, that leads away from your computer.\n\nUnfortunately, in the USA, peer-to-peer networks, insecure Wi-Fi networks, etc. are usually \"busted\" hop by hop, and if you fail to provide another hop back in the audit trail, then law enforcement assumes YOU are the end of the line, and prosecutes YOU for whatever crime they are fishing for.  This provides motivation for everybody to either not let their services be used by the public (bad), or keep records allowing for an audit trail to deflect the heat away from them (good).\n\nWould this be feasible to add to bitcoind and/or Bitcoin-Qt?  Implementation seems reasonable.\n",

It is not Sybil-proof in terms of information that can be harvested. Given that apparently \"tar pitting\" is a term now, it might not be sybil-proof in terms of nodes not co-operating.\n\nThe good news is that no hard fork is needed to change how the network works. You can just make a second one and have a sufficient number of nodes play in both networks.\n",
