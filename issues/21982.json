      "body": "Perhaps you can think of a way to test what you want to test without relying on how `CNetAddr::ToString()` formats IP-addresses as strings?\r\n\r\nAs I've said numerous times: I cannot see any reason to include `%zone_index` in `CNetAddr::ToString()` output, and I don't think that was ever the intention to include it historically: it just got to be that way due to our previous unfortunate OS dependence when formatting IP addresses. On some platforms `%zone_index` was included and one some it did not.\r\n\r\nAs you know on macOS we did not print `%zone_index` when doing `CNetAddr::ToString()`. Has that caused any problems that I'm missing?\r\n\r\nI could be missing some use case so that's why I'm asking you explicitly: setting aside your testing needs (which can be solved by not using `CNetAddr::ToString()` in the test), can you think of a single use case where one would like to have `%zone_index` being part of `CNetAddr::ToString()` output?",

      "body": "@jonatack \r\n\r\n> Did you drop the functionality intentionally?\r\n\r\nAgain: I'm not sure what \"functionality\" you're referring to:\r\n\r\n* If you by \"functionality\" mean not appending an unwanted `%zone_index` string to `CNetAddr::ToString()`, then yes that non-appending of an unwanted string is obviously intentional. The new implementation of `IPv6ToString` (which is called from `CNetAddr::ToString`) follows Rust's `std::net::Ipv6Addr` which does not append `%zone_index`. FWIW that is how the previous implementation of `CNetAddr::ToString` worked under macOS.\r\n* If you by \"functionality\" mean anything else, then no.\r\n\r\nFWIW this is what I said back in April 14 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21682#issuecomment-819897122) about this:\r\n\r\n> 1.) I don't understand why we test if `ToString()` output includes `%zone_index`: it clearly doesn't on some platforms, so we cannot rely on it anyways. Then why test it?\r\n> \r\n> 2.) And perhaps more fundamentally: why would we even _want_ to have `%zone_index` in our textual `ToString()` output? I think the expectation is to get say `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a` (without zone index) and not say `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a%eth2 ` or `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a%3 `when doing `ipv6_addr.ToString()` :)\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that you think something should be changed: feel free to open a PR making the changes you wish to see.",
