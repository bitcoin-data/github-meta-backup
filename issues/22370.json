      "body": "Block-relay only connections provide two advantages over normal connections:\r\n* They have far lower bandwidth overhead, while still providing partition protection. This means we can create more of them without worrying about resources costs of the node. Or in other words, while 8 full + 2 block-only connections is weaker in terms of relay power than 10 full connections, it has similar partition resistance as 10 full connections, while only costing resources barely higher than 8 connections in total.\r\n* They don't relay IP addresses or transactions, both of which have been used in various academically described attacks that use these to infer the network topology graph. If part of the graph is harder to know by attackers, that indirectly makes partition attacks harder.\r\n\r\nIn short: it's entirely expected that absent a partitioning attack, these connections don't do much.\r\n\r\nAnd to answer your question: it's not these nodes that are hard to detect - they're just normal nodes chosen at random like others - it's the presence of the connection that's hard to find.",
