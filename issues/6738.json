    "title": "OS X Build on Travis fails on downloading Clang",
    "body": "Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Make a fork of Bitcoin's repo.\n2. Enable Travis CI on that fork.\n3. Push the latest Bitcoin code in master to that fork.\n4. Wait for build to finish.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe builds should all pass.\n\nObserved Results:\n\nThe OS X build script tries to download https://bitcoincore.org/depends-sources/clang+llvm-3.3-amd64-Ubuntu-12.04.2.tar.gz .  This file doesn't exist on the https://bitcoincore.org server, and the resulting HTTP 404 error causes the build to fail.\n\nNotes:\n\nI suspect that this file is cached by Travis, which is why the builds appear to pass on the official repo's Travis (i.e. the file probably was there in the past and got cached).\n\nA full example build where it failed is at https://travis-ci.org/JeremyRand/namecore/builds/82854029 .  (If it's not clear, this repo is a Namecoin repo but the branch in question is identical to upstream Bitcoin.  It happened to be easier for me to push a new branch to the Namecoin repo than to enable Travis CI on a new Bitcoin fork repo.)\n",
