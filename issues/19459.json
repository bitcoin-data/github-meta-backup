      "body": "Hi, I don't see the issue here. See `BlockManager::FindBlockPos`. You have the \"Leaving block file\" message which means that it was a newly processed block. In adding this new block, the code noticed that blk file 96 would go over its 128 MiB size limit, so it finalized file 96 and went to new file 97. Part of that normal process is allocating the new file in 16 MiB chunks. This in itself has nothing to do with corruption. If you think there is some corruption involved, then there must be more context not mentioned in this issue.",
