    "body": "Making Bitcoin ready for inclusion into the `OSS-Fuzz` project should be fairly straightforward:\r\n* Have a look at [test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp) and read the [Bitcoin fuzzing documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md).\r\n* Make `test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp` `libFuzzer`-friendly by implementing `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`. See the [`libFuzzer` documentation for details](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html).\r\n* Create the three configuration files `project.yaml`, `Dockerfile` and `build.sh` as described in the [`OSS-Fuzz` new project guide](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/docs/new_project_guide.md) and submit an `OSS-Fuzz` pull request.\r\n\r\nToday [Google announced that they offer $1k to $20k in rewards for properly integrated project](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/05/oss-fuzz-five-months-later-and.html).\r\n\r\nHave a nice vacation and enjoy the warm fuzzy feeling of having helped secure the Bitcoin network! :-)",

It's a proof of concept that only tests a tiny part of the serialization/deserialization routines. I'm all for improving that, but the order should be:\r\n* Incorporate meaningful fuzzing tests (for example, including things like validating blocks received by a fuzzer with the cryptographically hard parts disabled).\r\n* Add buildsystem support for building against libfuzzer. This is useful independently from the OSS-fuzz project, as AFL and libfuzzer tend to have different strategies, and may find different problems.\r\n* Then we can have a discussion about submitting to OSS-Fuzz and whether their policy is acceptable.",

However it's still a hell of a lot better than being willfully ignorant of vulnerabilities, that could be independently found anyway. But yeah, it'd be great if they extended that deadline for bitcoin but if not, I don't see the big deal. And the damages of public disclosure can be heavily mitigated by a few days prior widely publizing the need to update.",

It seems quite odd to me to have a *single* fuzzing binary and input corpus.\r\n\r\nAny modern fuzzer (at least libfuzzer) is taking code coverage into account when generating new input. By joining all APIs to be fuzzed into a single call, and use the first 32 bit to switch between them, I'm sure we make genetic algorithm looking for inputs less efficient.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, it would be a lot more efficient to use *separate* binaries for each API to be fuzzed, *and* to use a separate corpus for each of them. It doesn't make much sense to test all inputs against all APIs.",
