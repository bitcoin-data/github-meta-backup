    "body": "If I create an RBF transaction using the Qt GUI but specify my own custom change address, bumpfee doesn't work because it claims it can't find the change address:\r\n\r\n    \"Transaction does not have a change output\"\r\n\r\nThis is because none of the outputs satisfy\r\n\r\n    pWallet->IsChange(...)\r\n\r\nI see there's a \"TODO\" commented in `CWallet::IsChange()` in `src/wallet/wallet.cpp`:\r\n\r\n    // TODO: fix handling of 'change' outputs. The assumption is that any\r\n    // payment to a script that is ours, but is not in the address book\r\n    // is change.\r\n\r\nI tend to put all my addresses in the address book whether I'm going to use them as change or not. I guess if the wallet was capable of creating its own SegWit change addresses I'd stop using custom change addresses, but currently it always seems to send change to a legacy address if I don't manually specify a change address.",

      "body": "@achow101: The scenario is: I make a transaction that spends a 100-ksat UTxO to make one 60-ksat output to Address A and one 39-ksat output to Address B, with the remaining 1 ksat offered as a mining fee. When I run `bumpfee` on this transaction, Bitcoin Core doesn't know which output to take additional funds from. You are saying it will add another input if necessary, but that's not what we want here. We want to reduce one of the two outputs so that more goes to mining fee. This is a very common scenario when one of the outputs is a genuine payment and the other is a self-transfer, e.g., to cold storage.",
