And of course, these are just standardness rules so in some cases you can work with miners to get non-std stuff mined.\n\nOpenTimestamps, for example, is defined in such a way that if OpReturn is blocked it can easily use other alternatives. And in the past, it actually has.\n",

      "body": "So the next step here for people who want to actually see this implemented is code, and perhaps more importantly, tests.\r\n\r\nThe code change is fairly simple: change the `datacarrierlimit` to default to max-int, and make the rule that checks if there is more than one OP_Return only take action if the limit isn't the default. I don't think there is any reason to implement a separate rule to check if there is more than one OP_Return if you aren't limiting the size.\r\n\r\nSecond, tests. You need to check that:\r\n\r\n- The previous limit is still enforced when `datacarrierlimit` is set.\r\n- Handling of OP_Returns of any size works correctly.\r\n\r\nScriptPubKeys that fill up entire blocks already exist in testnet, eg from the time [I rick-rolled testnet](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=146197.0). But OP_Return outputs are handled very slightly, so better if you can at least find one/mine one in testnet to prove they cause no consensus problems. An explicit test for this case wouldn't hurt either. As for large numbers of OP_Returns, again, we already have transactions with large numbers of outputs and OP_Return should not be any different. But it doesn't hurt to test this explicitly.",

That would be much quicker, especially considering how simple the change is. The only hard part might be writing tests, since the testing harness etc. does take a bit of getting used to... (that said, looking at the other tests usually can give one a good head start)\r\n\r\nThere are also many bounty websites where you can lock BTC into a vault that is only released to the person who does the bounty.\r\n\r\nI doubt many people that are sympathetic with this issue will see your comment unless you advertise it somewhere and/or offer a cash reward...\r\n\r\nor take a crack and learning some C++, maybe?
