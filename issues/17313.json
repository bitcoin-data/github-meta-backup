    "body": "From `uint64_t GetRdRand() noexcept `:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0d6b6b7c658b26810c35cb8f467157a1396ab041/src/random.cpp#L145-L150\r\n\r\nIn the case of ten `RdRand` failures in a row: wouldn't `r1` be read uninitialized on L150? (If so, then the same goes for the `__i386__` case a couple of lines above.)\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the odds of ten `RdRand` failures in a row are astronomically small, so I don't think this is urgent at all. Would be nice to rule out the theoretical possibility though (if such a possibility exists).\r\n\r\nFriendly ping @sipa :)",
