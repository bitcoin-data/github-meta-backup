This wouldn't have to update constantly, updating once every 10 minutes or so would help a lot.  I realize that the status of this source code has almost reached religious significance for those of us who are bitcoin maximalists, but I think this would be a great feature to add, if anyone wants to do it.

      "body": "Found this after I ungracefully killed my node process during IBD _(because I set the dbcache too high)_.\r\n\r\nUltimately, sometimes the software crashes and this is what needs to happen, but when it does we should be able to interrupt/shut down the client while this \"rolling forward\" process is happening. QT splash screen says \"press q\" but pressing q doesn't do anything, and bitcoind doesn't shutdown with Control+C. Only kill -9 gets the job done.\r\n\r\nI second @glendon144's suggestion that for QT, since the GUI doesn't launch until this process completes, perhaps a block height status should be displayed. If it's rolling forward, display the current height _(the logs show it, so the QT splash screen should be able to)_, and what block height it's rolling forward to _(if possible, not sure about this one)_.\r\n\r\n@somewhatnmc: looking at my logs in real time as I type this, and it appears to go through the blocks at an equivalent pace _(maybe slightly faster)_ to when it was originally validating those blocks. Your comment is 1+ year old but I'm responding to it for anyone new who might read this and be curious.",

I didn't believe it , thought it would be the case for those on an adsl 56Kb conn. turned out to be the case no matter what , pi4 can only run so hard. 8Gb would'av been better i suppose.  all the reboots won't speed anything up , quit the contrary , it might even corrupt the data. I did use the BTRFS option , which now I'm glad i did. I disabled run from behind tor from menu/settings , and cleared the cache every 2/3hrs the last two days. I exited the mainet and tried testnet ..which it synced successfully within three hrs , that gave me faith in going back to see it to the end on mainet.\r\n \r\nPatience still a virtue in 2021 ",
