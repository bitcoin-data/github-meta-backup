    "title": "Remove wallet global nTimeFirstKey",
    "body": "Taken from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15032#pullrequestreview-198677243:\r\n\r\nI think `nTimeFirstKey` is only read when the wallet is being loaded from file here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3b19d8e341a5234c3e41f59f7b3de8febfc51c21/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L4217\r\n\r\nIt's set in `LoadKeyMetadata()`, `LoadScriptMetadata()`, and `GenerateNewKey()` (through `UpdateTimeFirstKey()`) before then, but any time that `nTimeFirstKey` is set after wallet load is unnecessary, since it doesn't get read again, and isn't persisted to disk. Notably, any rpc calls that import keys don't need to update the `nTimeFirstKey`.\r\n\r\nI think `nTimeFirstKey` should be removed as a wallet global entirely. I think `-rescan` as a wallet command-line argument can also be removed since we now have the `rescan()` rpc method (removing `-rescan` has been suggested here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7061#issuecomment-303711520 and here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13044#issuecomment-384339967). _If_ we want to retain the ability to rescan from the wallet's birthday (ie the earliest key birthday in the wallet), then there should be a function `GetWalletBirthday()` to iterate through the wallet keys and return the wallet's birthday instead of having a wallet global.",

People think that it needs to be updated when any key is updated in the wallet. I spent quite a long time digging into the use of `nTimeFirstKey` in my review of #15032, and you believed that it needed to be updated even when reviewing this issue, after I told you that it doesn't need to be updated! The fact that we were both tripped up by this tells me that it's confusing and should be changed :slightly_smiling_face: ",

      "body": "> On an existing wallet, we should have a proper locator, so overwriting the block height of the locator with nTimeFirstKey seems fragile and unnecessary\r\n\r\nI figure it's supposed to be an optimization in case the locator gets zapped or something. But in the normal case agree it should be unnecessary. I think the proposal here is only to get rid of `nTimeFirstKey` without changing this behavior, though.\r\n\r\n> Question: Would we unnecessarily rescan the whole chain when loading an existing wallet that has one of the key's metadata.nTime == 1?\r\n\r\nNot unless the locator forked at the beginning of the chain. The `findFirstBlockWithTimeAndHeight` call treats `rescan_height` as a minimum block height.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e6e99d4f757f2e5052f0cc68951c75e91e4753e3/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L4511-L4513\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e6e99d4f757f2e5052f0cc68951c75e91e4753e3/src/interfaces/chain.cpp#L96\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e6e99d4f757f2e5052f0cc68951c75e91e4753e3/src/chain.h#L468-L469",
