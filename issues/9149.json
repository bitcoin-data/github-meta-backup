    "body": "https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/2016-09-29/?msg=73959763&page=4 (to show an example of a recent meeting)\r\n\r\nCurrently the IRC group is being used for discussion regarding development, but this doesn't allow for people in all time-zones to participate (e.g. it's 2am in Thailand).\r\n\r\nAlso the bitcoin-core-dev group is being used to discuss protocol changes, which obviously affects all other Bitcoin variants, so perhaps such topics ought to be moved to non-core specific areas.\r\n\r\nRaising this here as I am unaware of a more appropriate venue currently to raise this, as it is currently a core-specific issue (given it's the core specific chat room).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on a better forum/software to use for this? Ideally it ought to be something that allows likes/dislikes (as GitHub already has) to previous suggestions - doesn't rely on everyone being present at the same time - and ideally allows for threaded conversations and sub-topics to occur, yet allowing for an overall agenda to persist, perhaps with options to vote on proposals and keep a tally of votes, as well as the membership/status of participants (GitHub also already does this).\r\n\r\nOverall, given the criteria I am inclined to think GitHub may already be the best venue, but I do hope that others can agree that a venue that allows participants from varying timezones and allows inclusion of non-core participants for non-core issues is desirable.\r\n\r\nSo, this is two issues really - a better venue for bitcoin core discussion, and a better venue for overall bitcoin development discussion.",

The place for this is probably the bitcoin-dev mailing list.\n\nThe current time-slot has been chosen after asking and arranging with every interested participant finding the best slot that could work for most interested participants. Sure, we can (and probably should) re-evaluate a better, different time-slot every here and there (maybe once every year).\nBut my feeling tells me, that changing the timeslot will make things difficult for some.\n\nThe public IRC meeting is hold in #bitcoin-core-dev (just because it's most convenient there).\n\nIMO there are already various forums to discuss stuff (ex. https://bitcointalk.org).\n",

However, the minutes/summary of the meeting is always made available at bitcoincore.org. In the final analysis, there is no utilitarian outcome in me synchronously participating in the meeting because the matters being discussed, though interesting, are beyond my capacity as a hobbyist to influence or sway.\n\nThe same applies to you, since your repeated failure to make meaningful contribution to this project means you also lack the merit and reputation to influence the course of Core development.\n\nPlease put a plug in the constant revisitation of old issues and public questions you should correctly be researching on your own.\n",

This isn't really the place to discuss further the \"non-issues\" you refer to. My intention has always been to make bitcoin better, and if I raise an issue it's because I think it's an issue - this is presumably the same reason other people open issues. Subjectivity leads to non-consensus. It's incorrect to suggest either of us has no influence - your post above getting four thumbs-up proves you have influence, and some of my issues raised are considered issues - I am still learning how to determine in advance whether something I consider to be an issue will be considered to be an issue by other people. Please, let's not encourage school-yard behavior on here by dissing people in order to gain favor with others.\n",
