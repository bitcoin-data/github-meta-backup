      "body": "Well this goes back a long time. The GUI has never really shown transactions in the transaction list, it lists outputs.\n\nFor the sake of users it was decided to do it this way. When a transaction pays more of your addresses it's more useful to see them as separate entries. After all, mining pools, merchants and payment processors are free to group payments into sendmany transactions.\n\nThis means that a 'transaction' entry is really an 'output entry'. Yes, this is a bit double-talk-ish. In retrospect, maybe they should have been called differently to avoid confusion with Bitcoin transactions. That ship has sailed though.\n\n'Transaction details' hence _should_ use the UI interpretation of a transaction and thus shows details about that output.\n\n(It indeed also shows some half-baked information about the containing transaction in a debug-kind of way because no one bothered to change it since 0.3.x. But if you are one of the few people that care about the transaction details, instead of complaining, please help improving)\n",
