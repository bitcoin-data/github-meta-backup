    "title": "Transaction Fee Proposal",
    "body": "I propose the transaction fee should be calculated from a percentage of the input amount divided by the confirmations of the input multiplied by the number of inputs.\n\nBy using a percentage of the input amount the transaction fee will always make sense no matter what the \"price\" of bitcoins may be in fiat; by dividing the fee by the number of confirmations we discourage hasty spends and reward savings (ie. old inputs); by multiplying the fee by the number of inputs we discourage \"payment fragmenting.\"\n\nLet me further explain payment fragmenting by way of an example: Let's say I get paid $2,500 in bitcoins per month from my job. If I then take that $2,500 and pay for a coffee (right away, 1 confirmation) I'll be charged a fee of $2.50 because I'm charged according to the _input amount_, not the actual transaction size. Because of this it would behove my employer to pay me the $2,500 as one transaction with, perhaps, 100 output addresses at $25 apiece so that when I pay for my coffee I use one of the $25 unspent outputs. By multiplying the transaction fee be the number of inputs this provides a disincentive for payment fragmenting as multiple inputs will be required to pay for larger purchases.\n\nFurthermore this provides an incentive for wallet software to use the oldest input(s) which most closely match the transaction amount. For the example above: In real life a user's wallet would have a number of inputs to choose from and wouldn't use the newest \"paycheck\" input for the coffee purchase. Furthermore, even if the $2,500 input was the only input available, by waiting for 100 confirmations (less than a day) the transaction fee would be 2.5 cents.\n\nTransaction fees would then be calculated by the following formula:\n\n((INPUT_AMOUNT \\* BASE_PERCENT) / CONFIRMATIONS) \\* NUMBER_OF_INPUTS\n\nThe INPUT_AMOUNT, CONFIRMATIONS and NUMBER_OF_INPUTS would be determined by the creator of the transaction and should be optimized for the transaction amount -- the BASE_PERCENT would be hard-coded in the bitcoind software. The special case of zero CONFIRMATIONS will be treated as 1 confirmation in order to avoid a divide by zero error.\n\nFor example: if I choose a BASE_PERCENT of 0.1% and one input it will cost:\n- $1 to send $1,000,000 that has 100 confirmations;\n- $0.10 (10 cents) to send $1,000,000 that has 1,000 confirmations (approx. 1 week);\n- $0.10 (10 cents) to send $100 which has 1 confirmation;\n- $0.01 (1 cent) to send $100 which has 10 confirmations;\n- $0.001 (1/10 cent) to send $100 which has 100 confirmations (less than a day);\n\nI've put together a spreadsheet which shows the various fees by amount and confirmations -- the spreadsheet assumes one input for a transaction:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ovAQfxksQmOq3zYf79qFEDPCrSx58SmyK3Uwpu8iTUs/edit?usp=sharing\n",

      "body": "The required fee on a transaction will ultimately be decided by miners on a per-miner basis (each miner can choose their own policy).  AFAIK you can't force a fee policy on miners without soft forking.  An economically rational miner will be awarding their scarce resource - block space - to the highest bidders.\n\nI think the incentives are right at the moment.  Fixed fees make larger transactions cheaper on a percentage basis, which encourages maximum transaction volume through the blockchain, meaning that cheaper transactions will be the first to be pushed off-blockchain if it becomes unaffordable.  Subsidising blockspace for cheaper transactions flips this on its head and doesn't make economic sense for miners nor technical sense for scaling.\n",

You seem to have the cart before the horse here -- set the fees and have the mining community adjust as they have and will to block rewards.\n\nThe proposal I've put forward achieves a somewhat stable transaction fee regardless of the transaction amount or bitcoin price. Only outliers (very large recent inputs and very small old inputs) are subject to a non-standard fee.\n",

Block reward rules are enforced by every validating node,   However, validation does not force any fee policy, so miners are free to include whatever transactions they want in their blocks.  There are no rules that require the inclusion or exclusion of any valid transactions in a block.\n",

      "body": "Bitcoin is a consensus protocol. That means that every two nodes must be able to independently judge whether a block is valid, and come to the exact same conclusion. If two nodes disagree about whether a block is valid or not, they ignore each other (assuming the other is trying to attack them by serving invalid data). This means that if two groups of nodes with different rules both have hash power, but the larger of the two groups produces blocks the other side considers invalid, you get a blockchain fork. Both groups start working in their own world, ignoring the rest. This is a disaster: every coin that existed before the split can be spent once on each side.\n\nA \"soft fork\" is a change to the protocol rules that only makes things invalid that were previously valid. A soft fork is safe (doesn't actually cause the blockchain to fork) as long as majority of the hash power enforces the new rules.\n\nA \"hard fork\" is a change to the protocol rules that does anything else (change serialization, makes thing valid that would previously be invalid, ...). A hard fork requires every full node in the world to upgrade (not just the majority, and not just miners). Those who don't will inevitably end up with their own (slowly growing) chain.\n\nA policy is a rule that does not change the validity of blocks, and can't otherwise cause forks. These are usually about transactions, rather than blocks (as transactions are independent, and don't require the world to agree about any state). They include DoS protections, acceptance rules for entering the mempool, the scheduling miners use to put transactions into blocks, ...\n\nCurrently, the fee structure is a policy. You can change it in your client, and nothing will break. To an extent, every node in the network can change the policy to something they like, and things wouldn't break. The network wouldn't necessary keep working well, but at least nodes wouldn't start disagreeing about the state of the world.\n\nTo do what you want - enforce a fee structure - you must make them a consensus rule. Just implementing it as a transaction relay policy isn't enough: miners can just run different code, and as policy can't change the validity of a block, every node would need to accept those blocks, even if they don't like the transactions in it.\n\nTurning the fee rules into a consensus rule is technically possible. It would be a soft work (you want nodes to reject blocks that don't follow the fee rules), and that has associated risks. The only question is whether we want this to be a consensus rule. If we'd ever want to undo it, it would need a hard fork, so we better be sure about it.\n\nIn my opinion, it's such a dramatic change about the properties of the system (especially, future properties) that it would be a violation of the implied \"social contract\" of the system. However, that's not a very strong argument if it solves an actual or perceived problem.\n\nMore technically: how do you deal with decreasing subsidy? Who will pay miners for network security if the subsidy doesn't, and more is required than what your fee rules define? We don't know the future of the system, or for what kind of transactions it will be used. Maybe it will be many low-value transactions, maybe it will be few high-value transactions. Yes, variable fees are an inconvenience, but I don't think forcing a fee schedule is the solution. Over time, I think we'll see a fee market develop, but people live with changing gasoline prices too, no? \n",

      "body": "sipa: why would it _not_ require a hard fork to implement yet require one to remove?\n\nAlso, the formula would rely on the percentage, which could be changed just like the base fixed fee is now.\n\nI think determining the proper percentage would take some research and discussion, but once implemented wouldn't need to be changed, ever. It would need to be set so that Bitcoin most \"regular\" bitcoin transactions have a very low fee compared to alternatives, just as they do now, yet would support the necessary mining infrastructure. Knowing what is \"necessary\" is up for debate.\n\nOnce the percentage was set then, again, we have a policy which is predictable which miners can choose to participate in or not.\n\nHere is the key takeaway: right now miners are rewarded with new coins. Nobody is in the mining business to make money with transaction fees. Once they are they need certainty. Transaction fees to miners are currently uncertain because they are fixed and therefore have little relation to a bitcoin's value -- and \"standard\" fees need to constantly chase a bitcoin's value and be changed. By implementing a percentage-based fee structure fees now become predictable for miners and they can plan, just as they can reasonably plan now for block reward halving. This in addition to the certainty that is gained by Bitcoin \"users.\"\n\nCertainty is good. :)\n",

      "body": "I'm proposing a \"reluctantly accept\" feature in that it accepts the block\nreluctantly and indicates this in the GUI but didn't assist in its\npropagation hoping that instead a more savory block instead takes its\nplace. This certainly could be a way to really start giving some power to\nthe node operators who aren't also miners, or at least, let them feel they\nhave some say whether practically it makes a significant difference or not.\nIt'd be a win-win IMHO and would encourage more full node operators by\nempowering them with more of a say in the evolution of bitcoin.\n",
