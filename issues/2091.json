    "body": "Suggesting that bitcoind be able to bind to multiple anonymous (and regular) networks at once.\nInbound queries would reply out the same bind they were received on.\nOutbound initiates/broadcasts might be sent from all binds, or if impossible or out of context, to a specified one.\nGoal: Allow one daemon to service all networks [1] at once.\n[1] IPv4, IPv6, Tor, I2P, Phantom\n\nNote it should always be made possible option to not bind to '*' (all addresses),\nbut only to ones supplied.\n\nI'm not certain if -externalip can do this. -discover in doc/Tor.txt says:\n'If you want to run a dual stack, reachable from both Tor and IPv4 (or IPv6), you'll need to either pass your other addresses using -externalip'\nwhich implies maybe it can, but offers no syntax. Maybe it is a doc bug.\n\n-externalip=foo.onion (or Tor's OnionCat IPv6 /48)\n-externalip=bar.i2p (or I2P's GarliCat IPv6 /48)\n-externalip=6addr (.phantom / interpreted from its IPv6 /48 prefix)\n-externalip=6addr\n-externalip=4addr\n\nAlso, since socks context via -proxy breaks down with more than one such anonymous net, there would also need to be:\n-tor=host:port (in Tor, in bitcoin)\n-i2p=host:port (in I2P, not in bitcoin)\n-phantom=host:port (not in Phantom, not in bitcoin)\nand maybe\n-proxyipv4=host:port\n-proxyipv6=host:port\n",

      "body": "So, \"support\" for an external relay network requires:\n- The ability to internally resolve the equivalent of the relay network's \"IP addresses\", and send them to a separately-configurable proxy service.\n- The ability to relay such \"IP addresses\" over the P2P network.\n\nFor Tor, we cheated, by reusing some address space within IPv6 (the onioncat range) as onion IP addresses. This allowed fixing both issues at once, as we already internally and on the P2P network use IPv6 everywhere.\n\nI2P and cjdns cannot use this method, as their addresses are too large to fit in IPv6. Garlicat exists for mapping i2p into IPv6, but it requires an external lookup service to convert garlicat addresses to ful I2P addresses. I don't know phantom.\n\nIf we want to support more types of networks, the first step is probably adding something like a CExtNetAddr, which represents either a CNetAddr or some address in another network. The connection/proxy logic could easily support that.\n\nFor relaying, such a CExtNetAddr would need to become part of the P2P protocol. Maybe we wish to push for that at some point, but probably together with other improvements like host keys and authenticated connections.\n",

Now that Tor v3 hidden services are becoming more common, I think it's about time to extend the P2P protocol with a new kind of `addr` message that supports 256-bit network address (+ 8 bit network id + 16 bit port + ? bit service flags + 32 bit last seen time) instead of just the current 128 bit IPv6.\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion of this in the IRC meeting today:\r\nhttps://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/2018-05-31/?msg=100660820&page=4\r\n\r\nSome additional ideas that came up:\r\n- No longer embed Tor services in IPv6 onioncat (could keep doing this for HS v2, but just as well have separate network class for that)\r\n- How much to reserve for service bits (or whether it should be more than 64 as currently) wasn't clear yet.\r\n- There were questions whether something should be added with regard to BIP151 (encryption), such as gossiping pubkeys - but probably not, as this is trivial to MiTM.\r\n- Using new `addr` to gossip the storage range of blocks for pruning - however, it is not clear how this would be more useful than NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED, given that ranges tend to change faster than nodes can gossip.\r\n\r\nWhile looking around I found that there was some discussion in the zcash repository about this, but no concrete proposals yet:\r\nhttps://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1111\r\nhttps://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3051\r\n(and see also discussion in #9214)",

      "body": "> > Note that in addition to being necessary for I2P support, this change will be necessary to migrate to Tor's next-gen onion services (which will have addresses that are the same length as I2P's B32s).\r\n> \r\n> I'm planning to work on a BIP for this. Now that Tor v3 hidden services are becoming more common, I think it's about time to extend the P2P protocol with a new kind of `addr` message that supports 256-bit network address (+ 8 bit network id + 16 bit port + ? bit service flags + 32 bit last seen time) instead of just the current 128 bit IPv6.\r\n> \r\n> There was some discussion of this in the IRC meeting today:\r\n> https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/2018-05-31/?msg=100660820&page=4\r\n> \r\n> Some additional ideas that came up:\r\n> \r\n> * No longer embed Tor services in IPv6 onioncat (could keep doing this for HS v2, but just as well have separate network class for that)\r\n> * How much to reserve for service bits (or whether it should be more than 64 as currently) wasn't clear yet.\r\n> * There were questions whether something should be added with regard to BIP151 (encryption), such as gossiping pubkeys - but probably not, as this is trivial to MiTM.\r\n> * Using new `addr` to gossip the storage range of blocks for pruning - however, it is not clear how this would be more useful than NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED, given that ranges tend to change faster than nodes can gossip.\r\n> \r\n> While looking around I found that there was some discussion in the zcash repository about this, but no concrete proposals yet:\r\n> [zcash/zcash#1111](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1111)\r\n> [zcash/zcash#3051](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3051)\r\n> (and see also discussion in #9214)\r\n\r\nIs it possible to also add tor V3 authentication so that attacking tor nodes over p2p becomes infeasible. Currently with V2 there seems to be a lot of attack vectors, adding the native V3 auth would go a long way to preventing any future attack vectors.",
