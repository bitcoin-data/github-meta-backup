An example would be spending from a Lightning non-cooperative close or HTLC. The Core wallet would understand a Lightning cooperative close as that it is just spending from a 2-of-2 multisig which the Core understands (covered by descriptors). Any scripts not covered by descriptors (e.g. scripts covered by Miniscript or Lightning HTLCs that aren't covered by Miniscript) the Core wallet doesn't understand at the present time and needs the user to supply the weight of the external input.",
