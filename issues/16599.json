    "title": "ASN-based bucketing of the network nodes",
    "body": "Currently we bucket peers (or potential peers)  based on /16 network groups  which directly correlate to the IP-addresses. This is done to diversify connections every node maintains, for example to avoid connecting to the nodes all belonging to the same region/provider.\r\n\r\nCurrently peers.dat (serialized version of addrman) does not store ip->bucket mappings explicitly, and all the known ips from peers.dat are re-hashed and re-bucketed at every restart (although it's very cheap).\r\n\r\n## Idea\r\n\r\nIt was [recently](http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-06-20.html) suggested by @TheBlueMatt to use ASN-based bucketing instead. This is strictly better because if the goal is to diversify connections: the distribution of IPs among the ASNs is not uniform, and because of that netgroup-based bucketing may result in having 8 peers from just 2 large ASNs. \r\nIf we allow connecting to each ASN at most once, this would increase the security of the network.\r\n\r\nWe have @sipa's script to create a compressed representation of mapping (ip->ASN), which is less than 2 megabytes.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are integration-related design questions.\r\n\r\n### Distribution of the .map file\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting there was a rough consensus (not unanimous though, @jnewbery ) that mapping file should be distributed along with the release, instead of becoming part of the binary. \r\n\r\nIf you want to question these, feel free to comment below.\r\n\r\n### Legacy /16 bucketing\r\nThere was a suggestion of having an old method as well. I think we should do it.\r\n\r\n### ~Loading the map~\r\nMaybe there will be concerns here, I have an understanding for now.",

      "body": "@kristapsk @naumenkogs and I are working on a way to load a compressed IP-to-ASN map into bitcoind and use it for grouping IPs. The compressed scheme currently needs slightly less than 1 MB for a full map of the Internet.\n\nIt's an open question I think how this map will come to be. Initially I guess it'll just be optional and available for people to experiment with (using a command line flag and a file). Eventually we may want to bundle a map with Bitcoin Core or even make it part of the binary if this approach turns out to be useful.\n\nI wasn't aware of that publicly available GeoLite2 database; that looks useful to experiment with. So far I've been using a BGP router dump I got from somewhere.",

In light of that, for nodes that know their own IP address, would it make sense to divide AS buckets from an indivudal node perspective rather than from a global perspective?\r\n\r\nFor example if our node is in AS 1 and AS 1 has routes to AS 2 and 3, then for each new peer we check if it will route through AS 2 or AS 3 and spread equally over buckets. When AS 2 connects to AS 5 and 6, we again split the AS2 \"bucket\" between those two. No idea how much number crunching that involves (could wait until after IBD), or if there's even a reasonable algorithm.",

In order to avoid Western bias we'd need to do it across geographic regions and from many vantage points (eg maybe contact a Tier 1 and get their full routing table view, not just the selected routes), but once we get the infrastructure in place, further filtering can be played with.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to `traceroute` some of the nodes we connect to and re-bucket based on the ASNs of the first couple of hops? Or does such active probing draw too much attention?",

      "body": "So there are two parts to this proposal:\r\n- Use ASN information for addrman bucketing.\r\n- Use ASN information for determining which peers to connect to.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that using ASN information for addrman bucketing is likely to be very beneficial, as it prevents being blinded to peers outside of (eg) ASNs that an attacker might want to divert traffic towards.  I figure we should be able to make addrman large enough (if it's not already) that the increased collisions for AS's that have more nodes should not be a big problem.\r\n\r\nBut it's less clear to me if enforcing ASN-diversity on our outbound peers is beneficial or not, as it might drive connections to a relatively small part of the overall network graph.  For instance if there is an ASN with only 1 node (A) in it, and let's say there are a couple hundred ASNs in total with any nodes at all (fair assumption?), then rather than having a ~1 in 10000 chance of A being selected by a node making an outbound connection, A's chances will be more like 1 in a couple hundred.  This could have unfortunate side effects for other network-graph attacks (and EREBUS might even be easier in some situations as a result, since that attack revolves around using any AS for which the victim would route through the adversary's network to reach).  So this seems like a potentially large effect that I think would be worthy of more careful study before deploying.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach might be to just aim for node diversity at the addrman level (using ASN information if available, as suggested here), and then use peer rotation or frequent chain-tip-sync with random peers (like #16859) in order to reduce the likelihood of being eclipsed.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I realized I missed the IRC conversation on this, which I just read.  I did misunderstand the sampling effect of randomly sampling from all of addrman, as we do now with our existing /16 group limit, and presumably we would also do if we were to enforce an ASN connection limit as well.  Still, this seems to me like something we should model and study before deployment, as it's not clear at all to me what effect this would have on the network topology.  AS-diversity of our immediate peers is not clearly the thing we should be trying to maximize; if for instance dishonest peers can gain a connectivity advantage by locating themselves in small AS groups, that seems potentially problematic.",

I think we can agree that in terms of the physical level, this is an improvement.\r\n\r\nAsmap might make it worse if an attacker manages to spin up fake AS, but that can be handled upon asmap file distribution.\r\n\r\n### Logical level\r\nAny diversification makes certain nodes (placed in rare /16 groups or rare ASes) more likely to be chosen for connection.\r\nThis might make topology look less like a random graph. This is generally not a good sign, as it creates weakly connected components, which are easier to attack. \r\nThe effect on topology be represented by the variation of (AS/netgroup)->nodes] distribution. \r\nIn practice, however, salted hashing + bucketing makes the effect of the uneven distribution less noticeable.

But let me know if you would like any other measurements or if you have an opinion on AS-splitting.",

Could that make us more robust against adversaries able to game only one of the methods (but not both), and increase the cost of attack for adversaries who have the capability to game both methods? Is it overkill?\r\n\r\nSorry if that has been discussed previously or if I've misunderstood how things are meant to work.",

My thinking is that the attacker can easily influence the result of say next day's `asmap` generation process by adjusting what prefixes and AS paths he/she chooses to communicate.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting we should use a very stale `asmap`:s - just making the point that newer is not necessarily less attacker friendly :)\r\n\r\nOne mitigation could perhaps be to only consider routes and/or AS paths that have been stable for `N` months when generating the `asmap`.\r\n\r\nAssumptions I'm making:\r\n* Active attackers are typically participating during shorter time horizons compared to active non-attackers.\r\n* Routing table anomalies may go unnoticed over short time horizons, but are less likely to go unnoticed over long time horizons. (Perhaps that can be said generally for all types of observable anomalies? :))",

No much progress, but I wrote a [call to action on testing asmap](https://blog.bitmex.com/call-to-action-testing-and-improving-asmap/).\r\n3. Otherwise, the next step would probably be figuring out the map distribution strategy extensive testing of the tools(see previous point).\r\n\r\nAlso, I know there's a new paper coming (not public yet), saying how we could expand asmap approach even further.\r\nThe current asmap approach is still an improvement, but we should at least discuss going further with their recommendations, either right away or incrementally.

Perhaps there's a way to reduce the bandwidth burden for these nodes.\r\n\r\nIt's good in general to connect to a diverse set of ASN's so we don't get eclipsed. But for downloading blocks it seems unnecessary, since we know exactly what we're looking for. Perhaps during IBD (and long catchup) we could make additional outbound connections to a fast ASN. Hardcoding Amazon for this would be a bit dubious, but we could e.g. use whichever ASN gave us the fastest connection.",
