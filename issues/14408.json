If this is not the case the dependency autoconf scripts will fail. This means you cannot use a directory that located directly on the host Windows file system to perform the build.\"(i'm not sure about this caution, but try to do it just like the issue #14280 )\r\nSo, from the terminal above, i do:\r\ncd /usr/src\r\nsudo git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git\r\nPATH=$(echo \"$PATH\" | sed -e 's/:\\/mnt.*//g') # strip out problematic Windows %PATH% imported var\r\ncd depends\r\nbut then, it said :\"\r\n     -bash : cd :depends:No such file or directory\r\n\"(image below)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm so new to this, I need the construction to be specific , I'll appreciate that  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
