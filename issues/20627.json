    "title": "RFC: Migrate from Qt5 to Qt6's Qt5 compat",
    "body": "It seems like migrating to Qt6 is a win for multiple efforts, and I want us to evaluate switching to it as an alternative to monkey-patching Qt5/qmake to make it work properly.\r\n\r\n1. First class support for Apple Silicon for #20371 (see: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-85279)\r\n2. Transition from `qmake` to `cmake` (see: https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6-build-system)\r\n\t1. We already use `cmake` in depends to build several other tools\r\n\t2. `cmake` is much better maintained than `qmake`\r\n\t3. This might make a native/build split possible for `qt`, the last holdout package of native/build mixing after `boost` was recently split\r\n\t4. For PRs like #20600, where we're trying to work around `qmake`'s jankiness, I don't want people to pour their heart and soul into making `qmake` work just to be completely replaced by `cmake` when we bump in the future\r\n\r\nSupposedly, the switching cost is also minimal, as there's a Qt5Compat module (see: https://www.qt.io/blog/porting-from-qt-5-to-qt-6-using-qt5compat-library)",

I'm actually working (I suck at build stuff) on reverting to single archive in qt depends (requires an additional patch for 5.9.8) and simplifies adding qtdeclarative and qtquickcontrols2 modules (remaining modules are skipped ofc) or even qtmultimedia in the future for qrcode scanning.\r\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning that Qt6 requires C++17, which we already enabled for next version (#20413).",
