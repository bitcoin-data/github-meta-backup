    "body": "1. In Help -> Debug Window (which is the main window in -nowallet mode), on the Information tab, the \"Number of connections\" list incoming connections as \"Out\" (the nodes which you download blocks from) and outgoing ones as \"In\" (the ones you provide with blockchain info). Excuse me if I got it twisted, but I think it should be the other way around.\n2. Same window, Network Traffic tab: the naming is proper here, but I propose assigning color red  to \"In\" and green to \"Out\". This follows the logic of: \"In\" - \"leeching\" - \"bad\" - red, \"Out\" - \"seeding\" - \"good\" - green; subtly implying that it is important to keep a full node running and helping the network with data over longer time, instead of just hit-n-running. Lots of \"red\" will communicate this to the user, and lots of \"green\" will give a sense of satisfaction and inspiration to keep the node running (however corny sounding it is in words).\n",

There will only be incoming connections if your node listens and the listen port is reachable. The number of outgoing connections will never exceed 8. It has nothing to do with who requests blocks from who, bitcoin P2P connections are bidirectional in that regard.\n2. Sure, the colors could be swapped, I have nothing against that. Or maybe using red and green is not a good idea at all as people ascribe good/bad meaning to them (and some colorblind can't distinguish them - at my last employer this was informally called \"the christmas tree effect\").\n",

I don't know, maybe \"in\" and \"out\" should have different names on the Network Traffic tab (like \"uploaded\"/\"downloaded\" or something else).\n2. Yeah, the logic was very reduced and generalized here (\"good\", \"bad\", etc), to make it commonly understood. You could use different colors, but without colors I don't know how to effectively distinguish them - using different line strokes may be an option but seems inadequate.\n",
