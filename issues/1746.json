It probably wouldn't take a lot of time with a friends device to produce the actual communication after that.\n\nNFC is quickly becoming the standard/preferred means of performing bitcoin transactions, and it would be really nice to see the reference client support it. I think it would help to assert NFC as a standard/expected feature, and encourage all other clients to follow suit.\nI also think a lot of people have the most trust in the reference client, and NFC on PC clients is certainly useful in business situations.\n",

In the case of a chip based smartcard, the POS would need to prompt the user to enter a PIN I imagine too.\n\nThat obviously doesn't need to be done immediately, but I think the protocol should define and support it.\n\nOne other communication for the protocol would be a balance request. If the phone has no network connection, the client app will still want to show the users balance, at which point the device will have to request the balance from the POS terminal.\n",

I see absolutely no reason to do the same in the NFC case, especially because at that point you are most certainly already communicating with the merchant anyway.\n\n@TurkeyMan: Bitcoin internally has no concept of balances, and I'm strongly against defining something like that. Balances are a wallet's responsability (especially since just the balance isn't enough; you need the transactions ids, amount, and txout scripts of the transactions crediting you anyway to construct a payment). Also, I certainly don't want our NFC protocol to be a proxy for a client device to connect to the internet. If it needs that, it should do so by itself.\n",

They don't need to start updating their facebook or twitter posts.\n\nAm I misunderstanding the transaction history? I can imagine a query to provide the transaction history for an address back to a particular point (the last record the device has I guess) would be a simple thing to serve, and allow the device to keep its user-facing record of the current balance accurate.\n",

      "body": "@laanwj /agree, it makes it more complicated than just the URL, but the only significant trust issue I see is requesting a PIN number from the POS device, and this is equally an unsolved issue with modern credit card POS terminals and ATM's. At least the security risk is familiar, and to make malicious use of collected PIN numbers, you need to acquire the users wallet card. Offline phones can enter their own pin on the screen, it's just a basic Electrum payment.\n\nI would approach it like this (if I had time to offer):\n\nStarting point, no security concern:\n- one-way URL request; as a start (set the standard that NFC is expected in all bitcoin clients)\n  - POS monitors the network for satisfactory confirmation\n- basic Electrum style payment; offline devices (authentication performed on the device)\n  - begins with a URL request, as above, but a second NFC touch may return a signed transaction\n\nThen much lower priority:\n- Electrum payment with pin request on POS terminal; for cards (trust concerns)\n- transaction history (maybe?); show the user their balance (what advantage would the POS have to lie?)\n",
