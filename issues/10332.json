    "body": "There's some pretty severe limitations with all the current rpc APIs to send a transaction, so I think it might make sense to create a more generalized API that subsumes them (createrawtransaction, fundrawtransaction, sendmany)\r\n\r\nArguments it should have:\r\n\r\n*  `transactions` (from `createcrawtransaction`) with the difference that if you leave `sequence` undefined it uses normal core sequence number picking, instead of 0\r\n\r\n* `amounts` from `sendmany` but *not* an object, but an array of outputs (the current object makes it very annoying to implement batched withdrawal logic when multiple payments are to the same address), along with the addition of `subtractfeefromamount` as an option in the object\r\n\r\n* The options from `fundrawtransaction`, along with the additional ability to pick to broadcast the transaction or not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnd the return should contain the full transaction, txid, fees paid, and location of the change.",

The current one has significant enough limitations for advanced use cases that I've actually found it easier as a client to use a bitcoin library to create the transaction and then pass it to bitcoin core to sign. \r\n\r\nA simple example is that when you're batching sends, you might not want to send to the same address multiple times. Or maybe you want to use a particular input  (e.g. when issuing someone a refund/withdrawal, you want to make sure if their initial payment failed to confirm their refund would also do so)\r\n",

There's a few legitimate use cases for it, and it can also drastically simplify the clients logic (i.e. can assume a unique txid:vout for each queued send).\r\n\r\n> And if you want to use a particular input, would this one not do the trick:\r\n> createrawtransaction [{ \"txid\":\"input_txhash\",\"vout\":input_n }] {\"refund_address\": refund_amount}\r\n\r\nNot really, that has a few problems. For one, all those inputs would have a sequence of 0, which would make your transactions more recognizable. Then you still need to deal with cases like adding change address and sourcing additional inputs if needed (i.e. all the stuff fundrawtransaction does). And then you need to figure out how much fees to apply (which changes based on the size of the transaction.\r\n\r\nAnd then by the time you've solved all those problems, you'd probably just wish there was a generalized api call for it... ;D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
