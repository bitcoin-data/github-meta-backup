I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\n\r\nThe block file pre-allocation takes too long as currently done by `fallocate_posix` on Linux (ext4).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\nThere is a way to make it uncomparably faster. I am not yet sure if it is switching to another function for Linux, or just setting some options for the `fallocate_posix`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\nI know that file allocation in [TransmissionBT](https://github.com/transmission/transmission) torrent client is very fast on Linux. These commits I have identified from searching the logs as related, ordered from newest to oldest: transmission/transmission@a2d56b832, transmission/transmission@99d53d7ef, transmission/transmission@de2d0154e, transmission/transmission@4723b4a6e.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ man 2 fallocate\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n\r\nBecause I can not work more on it right now, I am dumping what I have found so far into this issue. Feel free to comment or even make a PR. Thank you!",

Thanks for pointing that out.\r\n\r\nFrom https://manpages.debian.org/buster/manpages-dev/posix_fallocate.3.en.html:\r\n> NOTES\r\n> In the glibc implementation, posix_fallocate() is implemented using the fallocate(2) system call, which is MT-safe. If the underlying filesystem does not support fallocate(2), then the operation is emulated with the following caveats:\r\n>  - The emulation is inefficient.\r\n>  - …\r\n\r\nWhile I thought it is still relevant I was about to write all of following:\r\n\r\n> Currently, glibc provides an interface called posix_fallocate() which\r\n> can be used for similar cause. Though this has the advantage of working\r\n> on all file systems, but it is quite slow (since it writes zeroes to\r\n> each block that has to be preallocated). Without a doubt, file systems\r\n> can do this more efficiently within the kernel, by implementing\r\n> the proposed fallocate() system call. It is expected that\r\n> posix_fallocate() will be modified to call this new system call first\r\n> and incase the kernel/filesystem does not implement it, it should fall\r\n> back to the current implementation of writing zeroes to the new blocks.\r\n\r\nFor more info see https://lwn.net/Articles/239738/ (source of above quote)\r\nand [upstream commit to glibc](http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/i386/posix_fallocate.c;h=c974d06afc6c04a831c054c0490448f04764c8b0;hb=5e0923ab31aa77bbd46737c4b8b327dbe2494b00)\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that [WIN32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/util/system.cpp#L1084) and [MAC_OSX](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/util/system.cpp#L1093) have an unfair advantage of already using some optimizations in `src/util/system.cpp` for file allocation, while Linux uses `posix_fallocate` which works but is clearly not optimal and does not provide a way for filesystem maintainers to offer their own best practices.",
