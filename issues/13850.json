    "title": "Dynamic configuration of ZMQ notifications",
    "body": "Bitcoin's ZMQ notifications can currently be enabled (or not) through `-zmqpub...` startup arguments, but there is no way to enable more (or perhaps disable existing) notifications dynamically at runtime.  This would be useful, so that software that wants to subscribe can configure the daemon accordingly (in conjunction with `getzmqnotifications`).\r\n\r\nThe most straight-forward way to implement dynamic addition of notifications is to add a new RPC `addzmqnotification` like this:\r\n\r\n    $ bitcoin-cli addzmqnotification pubhashtx tcp://127.0.0.1:5678\r\n    (returns the address, \"tcp://127.0.0.1:5678\")\r\n\r\nThis call would add a new `pubhashtx` notifier on the given address, either reusing an existing socket or creating a new one.  This is very similar to how it could be created with `-zmqpubhashtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:5678`.\r\n\r\nA potential difference to the existing CLI argument is that the RPC could, if desired, allow multiple `pubhashtx` notifiers on different addresses.  Alternatively it could refuse to create a second one if one is already active and instead return the address of the existing one in that case.\r\n\r\nThere are two minor issues I have with this proposal:\r\n\r\n1. It allows an RPC client to induce the daemon to start listening on an arbitrary address/port, which might be a security risk.\r\n\r\n2. A ZMQ subscriber that wants to enable a certain notification probably doesn't care too much about the exact address/port, and might not want to be responsible for actually choosing one.\r\n\r\nIssue 1) is IMHO not a big concern, as access to the RPC interface already allows a lot of things to be done and should be restricted anyway.\r\n\r\nFor 2), we could make the second argument of `addzmqnotification` optional or remove it completely.  The address would then be chosen from an existing notification, or could perhaps be set using a generic `-zmqaddress` option; the RPC would return the chosen address.  This would shift more sensitive configuration back to the startup options, while still allowing subscribers to dynamically enable the notifications they need.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this proposal, does it make sense?  Is there a better way to implement dynamic addition of ZMQ notifiers?  (I know @promag is also interested in that - any input?)",

But perhaps I was thinking of [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13526#issuecomment-400146643) at the time.\r\n\r\n> Anyway I think if it should not be possible. For instance, it's not possible to dynamically add more RPC users — should it be possible? Beside, we use PUB/SUB which means that once the publisher is configured it can have multiple subscribers.\r\n\r\nThe usecase I had in mind here are front-end applications that hook onto a Bitcoin Core daemon.  If they need (for their particular situation) some ZMQ notification (e.g. block hashes), then they would be able to ensure that the currently running daemon supplies these notifications.  Without that, those applications could just throw an error at the end user and ask them to manually update their `bitcoin.conf`.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is a different situation from dyanmically adding RPC users.  Also adding multiple subscribers won't help, since the main reason for this feature is enabling (or disabling) notifications that are not turned on in the first place.\r\n\r\nThat said, I've not really had a strong need for this myself since when I opened the issue.  So we can happily close it if that seems not like a useful feature to you and others.",
