This makes sense because tracking that information for every received block would slow down the process too much.\r\n\r\nProposed solution: If one of the startup tasks were to identify the blockheight at which tracking fees would become useful, then the process could start tracking them once the blockheight was there.  Otherwise, other layers that rely on `estimatesmartfee` (like ACINQ's Eclair Lightning node) have to wait an extra hour even though bitcoind has all the information it needs.\r\n\r\nIf there is information required by `estaimatesmartfee` that is not available to a node which has just finished downloading the blockchain, please add a comment explaining what it is.",

      "body": "Your assumption about how Bitcoin Core's fee estimation is incorrect. Bitcoin Core estimates the fee by observing how long transactions stay in its mempool. It tracks the fee rate for an unconfirmed transaction and how many blocks pass from the time it entered the mempool to when it is finally included in a block. This is how it can give estimate for different block targets. So in order for fee estimation to work, your node must have a mempool and must have seen transactions go from unconfirmed to confirm. It cannot derive fee information from just blocks. Doing so would allow miners to rig fee estimation by packing a couple blocks full of super high fee transactions and cause such fee estimators to estimate extremely high fees unnecessarily.",
