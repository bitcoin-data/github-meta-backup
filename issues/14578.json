    "body": "<!-- Describe the issue -->\r\n**Issue is with [\"sendmany\"](http://chainquery.com/bitcoin-api/sendmany) RPC call (I may not have been clear, sorry)**\r\n\r\nPlease refer to these two issues here:\r\nhttps://github.com/foxer666/node-open-mining-portal/issues/145\r\nhttps://github.com/foxer666/node-open-mining-portal/issues/106\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the batch RPC transaction call fails - one is due to an invalid address, the other due to batching more than 10-15 transactions. You will have to forgive me, I lost the reference to the original article/issue that I read where it said if you batched too many transactions it would fail.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n**Expecting:** One transaction in the batch to fail, the rest to execute normally\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n**Actual:** All transactions in the batch fail, causing other programs such as NOMP which use them to fail = no payments to miners!\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n**Reproduce:**\r\na) Make a batch RPC call to send to 50-100 addresses\r\nb) Make a batch RPC call to send to a few addresses, one of them being invalid\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nUsing a fork of a fork of (probably a fork) of bitcoin core. This affects all forks of bitcoin - literally all of them. Hopefully they will merge the fix to the batch RPC send.\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n**Machine:** Vultr VPS ($10/Mth - 1 CPU, 2048 MB RAM, 40GB disk)\r\n\r\nI will make work arounds in NOMP. Then I will search for where I saw about batch transactions and post a reference link here. You may already have an open issue (I checked briefly, cant find)\r\n\r\nThanks",

I thought there was a confusion, I am sorry if I was not clear about that.\r\n\r\nI just looked at the RPC page for sendmany http://chainquery.com/bitcoin-api/sendmany\r\n\r\nI see what you mean, because the original return value is **only** a transaction ID which if you change it to a JSON result, will break every single program that is set up to expect a transaction ID as a result.\r\n\r\n**sendmany return information:**\r\n\"Result:\r\n\"txid\"                   (string) The transaction id for the send. Only 1 transaction is created regardless of \r\n                                    the number of addresses.\"\r\n\r\nThe thing is, this is why there is a such thing as a \"Hard Fork\" and \"Soft Fork\". \r\n\r\n**One way to make it work without breaking compatability** is to bring the new command in stages, and depreciate the old one over time...\r\n\r\n**Example:** _sendmany_ operates as normal until depreciation date, sendmany-new operates the new way until _sendmany_ depreaciation date, and then _sendmany-new_ gets it's own depreciation date later on...\r\n\r\nThat gives backwards compatability, notice, and time for developers to switch over to the new version of sendmany, which has better return information telling them which tx failed and why. It also allows you to fix the issues with sendmany failing in the two specific instances in the OP.\r\n\r\n**Is this not possible?**\r\n\r\nP.S.

      "body": "I was having trouble understanding this issue, because I thought it was referring to [JSON-RPC batch requests](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch), but it sounds like this is just talking about calling the `sendmany` RPC method to send one payment to a lot of recipients.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14578#issuecomment-433659038, leshacat seems to be asking for `sendmany` to return a more detailed response in case of failure. But the response format shown there doesn't really make sense because `sendmany` currently only creates single transaction and doesn't know about block heights. Also errors like \"insufficient funds\" would apply to transactions, not addresses. \r\n\r\nMaybe in the future it wound be good to have a `sendmanytxs` method which sends multiple transactions to a long list of recipients that don't necessarily fit in a single transaction. In the meantime, we probably should replace \"send multiple times\" in `sendmany documentation`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/29f429dc7d4c7e6cd012e749cadf89e3138bcab3/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L766\r\n\r\nwith something to clarify that it only makes a single transaction.\r\n\r\n@leshacat, I would agree with sipa that \"there is no solution except validating your inputs.\". If your application isn't checking that addresses are valid as soon as it receives them, and instead it is failing at the point of trying to send a payment, that sounds like it would only be making invalid address issues harder to debug at the same time as making your payment code more complex...\r\n\r\nRe: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14578#issuecomment-433737122, backwards compatibility is not a major concern here. There are many ways we can extend APIs while remaining backwards compatible, and it would make sense to first figure out what the ideal API would actually look like before getting into the weeds of backwards compatibility.",

So the posting I read must have been someone mid-trail finding the cause of the issue.\r\n\r\nIf this is an issue of too many inputs/outputs and not too many transactions in the batch, I will work on this from my end then. I think I found a fix for it in z-nomp. This adds to context of why you cannot simply change this.\r\n\r\nEither way I intended to work on it from my end, I only raised the issue because I believe validation should be done on both sides, as well as also batch processing should support large batches on both sides.\r\n\r\n**Thanks for the quick replies, and sorry for consuming resources and time from your busy days :) Obviously thanks for BTC :)**",
