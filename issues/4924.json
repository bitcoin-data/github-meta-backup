    "title": "Sync stopped after drive ran out of space",
    "body": "I've installed the latest version of Bitcoin core 0.9.2.1 for Windows (64bit), than I've downloaded bootstrap.dat from the torrent file and put it into C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin and than I ran the bitcoin-qt.exe file. It started importing blocks from the bootstrap.dat file and after that it started syncing but after a little it got stuck while I ran out space on my C: drive and I got message \"Low on space!\" so I closed the wallet, transfered the whole Bitcoin folder to another partition (with 100GB of free space) and ran the wallet again but it was not syncing and I got stuck at block #285337.\nAfter that I reindexed the blockchain at @apoelstra's suggestion using the -reindex command but still after it finished reindexing it didn't want to sync and it got stuck again.\nThe solution was to delete everything, uninstall the Bitcoin Core, I ran CCleaner and fixed the registry (there was the exe file of the Bitcoin Core app on the list of the broken registry files), everything was cleaned up, then I reinstalled the wallet, put the bootstrap.dat again into the data folder(on the new partition) and it worked out ok in the end.\n\nMy suggestion would be to put some kind of a limit on the drive where the blockchain is being installed so the blockchain download doesn't \"eat up\" the whole system capacity. So for example if the user has 1GB of free space left the wallet could detect that and pop out a message, for example \"Your drive has ran out of space, the sync has stopped. Please change the directory or empty some space on the drive\" so in that case the sync could start again normally after you free up the space on your drive or you change the directory of the files so the sync doesn't get broken.\n",

Not clear if Bitcoin actually ran the hard drive out of space (which could make for database inconsistencies or corruption). Not clear if Bitcoin was properly and completely closed before data files were manually moved.\n\nLocking fixes committed over the last year should have fixed the original result of running out of datadir space, which was to crash spectacularly.\n\nI think this is better resubmitted as an (improvement)(feature) request focusing on the specific area where improvement is thought to be needed. A really good bug report has a pull request, and if not, a specific code change request. I'll outline two feature requests that are compact enough in scope to be addressed:\n1. OS Installer: Include insufficient datadir disk space check/warning upon install.\n   \n   a. set minimum disk free space as educated guess for near future ~40gb (similar to checkpoints),\n   b. in case of reinstall, subtract existing %datadir%/blocks/*.dat file sizes from warning calculation.\n   c. write helpfile button for warning describing -datadir option to choose alternate data location.\n2. add installer wizard panel showing default datadir, with option to browse and select custom datadir (a non-default directory selection would be written to bitcoin.conf)\n\nI fear that disk space checking routines would be quite platform-dependent, needing a universal library to be included for this before one can think about what Bitcoin Core does with this information.\n",

Please change the directory or empty some space on the drive\" or something between those lines.\nTaking up the whole memory on the default partition which is in most cases system partition before it actually displays the mentioned message is not really a good thing.\n\nI am not saying the sync got stuck because of disk space but trying to find a reason for it, because I most surely transferred everything nice and normal to another partition and pointed the wallet to the new directory and it didn't want to continue syncing. So what could be the reason ?\n\nI think there is more improvement to be made on this issue and especially on that warning message and the limit to the disk space that blockchain download actually takes.\n",
