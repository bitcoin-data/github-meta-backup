The number of daily transactions isn't exactly at an all time low. \r\nI agree that the fee structure is aging. I disagree that the solution would be to reject transactions. \r\nIf anything that would be an incentive for miners to only pick up transactions with very high fees. \r\nThe difficulty mechanism was always assuming a somewhat natural growth of hash power.\r\nWe reached the point where the processing power is wasted because no better system has been engineered. \r\n\r\nIt's not an easy problem to solve. I'd like to help with it but I won't ever do it alone and the echo I've had from core devs seems to be \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" (ironically the same reason why banks still use IBM mainframes). \r\nI digress.
