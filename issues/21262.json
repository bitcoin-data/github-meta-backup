    "title": "Spurious log entries when using descriptor wallets",
    "body": "I've been testing out watch-only descriptor wallet usage on 0.20.0 with BIP32 Electrum/HW wallets, and while it appears to be generating the correct addresses, it keeps making seemingly unnecessary log entries in debug.log with the default logging level. Specifically, on startup, it complains that:\r\n\r\n> [testwallet] External scriptPubKey Manager for output type 0 does not exist\r\n> [testwallet] Internal scriptPubKey Manager for output type 0 does not exist\r\n> [testwallet] Internal scriptPubKey Manager for output type 1 does not exist\r\n> [testwallet] Internal scriptPubKey Manager for output type 2 does not exist\r\n\r\nand every time getnewaddress is invoked, it logs:\r\n\r\n> [testwallet] External scriptPubKey Manager for output type 0 does not exist\r\n\r\nIt seems to be complaining that I didn't load descriptors for P2PKH receiving addresses or any type of change address, but seeing as this is a watch-only wallet that is only using p2sh-segwit and bech32 type addresses, that is expected, and unless I'm misunderstanding something here, this should not raise any errors unless I actually try to generate addresses of that type.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreatewallet \"testwallet\" true true \"\" false true true\r\nimportdescriptors '[{ \"desc\": \"wpkh([.../84h/0h/0h]xpub.../0/*)#...\", \"timestamp\":\"now\", \"active\": true, \"range\":[0,100000] }]'\r\nimportdescriptors '[{ \"desc\": \"sh(wpkh([.../49h/0h/0h]xpub.../0/*))#...\", \"timestamp\":\"now\", \"active\": true, \"range\":[0,100000] }]'\r\n\r\ngetnewaddress \"\" bech32\r\ngetnewaddress \"\" p2sh-segwit\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth invocations of getnewaddress work and generate the correct address, but trigger the error to be logged.",
