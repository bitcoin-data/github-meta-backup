    "body": "The current secure allocator uses mlock a lot, pretty much on a per-page granularity.\n\nThe secure allocator makes use of a LockedPageManager to keep track of locked an non-locked pages. It locks the pages returned by the system allocator and unlocks them when no 'secure' allocations are on that page anymore.\n\nIt would be preferable to use a pool-based system, which pre-allocates areas of mlocked memory and deals these out as necessary.\n\nThe uses of SecureAllocator are: \n1. SecureString (string, used for wallet passphrases in CWallet interface). \n2. CKeyingMaterial (vector&lt;char>, used for CCrypter interface and to store the master key in CCryptoKeyStore object). \n3. CPrivKey (used to store wallet keys)\n\nThe allocation pattern for these three is different\n- SecureString \n  - is only used for small periods (argument passing).\n  - never stored for longer spans of time.\n  - allocated infrequently and not in performance-critical places\n  - dynamically-sized array of char\n- CKeyingMaterial \n  - is used for argument passing, and one of these is stored for a longer time for locked wallets\n  - allocated infrequently and not in performance-critical places\n  - dynamically-sized array of char\n- CPrivkey, on the other hand\n  - is allocated and deallocated frequently when loading a wallet or when generating large amounts of keys (for the keypool)\n  - usually they are only allocated and stored, though deallocation happens when these objects are copied around, for example as return values\n  - fixed-size objects\n\nAs the CPrivKey allocation pattern is the only one that causes performance issues and it requires only fixed-size objects no arrays, a possible solution is to use a boost::pool of mlocked memory chunks for just these.\n",
