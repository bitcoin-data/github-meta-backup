    "title": "importx / importprivkey (rescan=last block) RPC command?",
    "body": "Thoughts on adding a new RPC command like `importx` that imports a known transaction ID directly into the wallet? Or, when calling `importprivkey`, add another parameter that tells the rescan to only go as far back as the block specified? e.g. (`importprivkey <privkey> rescan=true xxxxxx`) Maybe both?\n\nMy use case:\n\nI've been experimenting with stealth addresses and as the receiver of a stealth payment, you don't know the private key in advance to redeem your funds. This is calculated using data from one of the null outputs (OP_RETURN). When you find a match and the associated private key, you need to import it into your wallet. Since the transaction ID is already known, this makes a rescan unnecessary and a waste of resources, unfortunately it must be done though if you want the balance and transaction to be added to the wallet.\n",

I'd think that Stealth support would be great, but that's like moving mountains compared to what I'm asking for.\n\nEither:\n1. Expose `rescan` to rpc and startup `-rescan` flag and a parameter to accept the start block. By default, it's the genesis block. In other words, just expose the method `ScanForWalletTransactions` as seen here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/src/wallet.cpp#L930 (Would probably want to modify `importprivkey` as well to have a parameter for starting block as well)\n2. Expose a method to add the transaction to the wallet i.e. `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe` via RPC. Method found here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/src/wallet.cpp#L684\n\nEven better, add both changes. \n",
