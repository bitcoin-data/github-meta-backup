    "body": "The `maxtxfee` check is applied at the very final stage of creating a transaction, which with a large amount of inputs and/or a low `maxtxfee` setting will cause coinselection to frequently propose a solution that will just be rejected, even though there are many other possible selections which would not exceed the maxtxfee setting.\r\n\r\nThe simplest fix I believe would be make each \"stage\" of the coin selection aware of the `maxtxfee` setting, and go to the next when it can't satisfy it.\r\n\r\ne.g. if the BnB algorithm can find a selection that requires 0.01 BTC of fees, but the maxtxfee is set to 0.005, it shouldn't bother suggesting it.\r\n\r\nAnd then there could be a final fallback algorithm that is an extremely simple greedy one that picks the largest inputs, where if that fails then there is no hope and an error given.",
