    "title": "[discussion] Dealing with assertions and optional consistency checking",
    "body": "Currently the Bitcoin source code relies on assertions (because they may have side effects), and some compile-time and runtime settable consistency checks.\n\nThis leads to a few odditiies:\n- Failing to build with -NDEBUG\n- Uncertainty what performance impact consistency checks have.\n- Conflict between the 'asserts are good because it tests the assumptions you're relying on hold'/'better fail than have undefined behavior' and 'asserts are bad because if they're exploitable they're potentially a massive DoS to the network'.\n\nThis leads to only limited assert usage (because you don't want them for anything potentially exploitable), and a few very expensive optional consistency checks (-checkmempool, DEBUG_LOCKORDER, ...).\n\nMy proposal:\n- Add a -checks command-line flag which enables inexpensive consistency checks.\n- Enable -checks by default in debug builds, but not in release/gitian builds.\n- Add a safe CHECK() macro which\n  - always evaluates its arguments\n  - is a no-op without -checks but like assert() with -checks.\n- Get rid of all assert()s.\n",

We have even seen this in bitcoin.\n- assert() should only ever be used for \"should never happen\" type conditions, where a crash or undefined behavior results should the assert otherwise be absent\n\nObservations on checks:\n- Yes.  Yes.  Goal should be to turn on as much inexpensive runtime checks as possible, always.\n- Related goal, make checks as inexpensive as possible, so as to not punish the user (and therefore encourage the user to want to turn off the checks).\n- Can use the compiler's branch prediction hints (likely/unlikely macros)\n- Related, make debugging/diagnostic dumps easy for the user to trigger\n\nCheap runtime checks are good.  Asserts are bad.\n",

      "body": "Well, leveldb is separate in any case. I don't suggest changing their assertion behavior.\n\nI'm very aware of the reasons why asserts exist, and why turning them off is bad. What I'm saying is that in production environments, it may be better to not risk blowing up the process due to an overeager check, as that automatically means a huge risk to the network if that assert is triggerable by a network condition. If it's based on a relayable message, it may even wipe out the network entirely.\n\nWhat I want is more of these checks, more as a way for the programmer to say \"this is what I assume here\", more than \"if this doesn't hold here, we're in BIG trouble\". It makes the code clearer, and simultaneously verifies that such assumptions hold. But only in cases where we're not at risk of hurting the network by dying.\n\nI don't have a good answer for what to do when things are clearly blowing up. Perhaps the checks that we are _really_ sure about indicate irrecoverably bad state and _really_ sure cannot be triggered by the network can remain asserts, but I'd rather see them turned off in production if that means we can have more checks in the code.\n",

Everyone will test with the debug build, and then problems appear in the release build which no one has tested before the actual release :-) Also having a build that intentionally strips sanity checks makes troubleshooting harder. So yes, run-time instead of compile-time disabling is preferable where possible.\n\nSo for critical checks we should have an 'assert' that ignores NDEBUG.\n",
