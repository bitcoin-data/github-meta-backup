    "body": "### Hello friends,\r\nDepending on the current source, it is possible to get output for different platforms in a responsive mode!\r\n\r\n- I know you have worked hard and this is admirable. In my opinion, we need to improve the bitcoin wallet, especially the user interface part.\r\n- I know that the C++ community has a great deal of expertise in this area and can provide the best output for the bitcoin community that it deserves!\r\n\r\n**Therefore, we can work together to improve it as much as possible, and I, as a member of C++ community, have some suggestions:**\r\n\r\n1. Reviewing and Redesigning the codes of the bitcoin core wallet, especially the UI and improving the UX according to [this process](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Bitcoin-Core-App).\r\n2. Reviewing and improving the modern user interface in a completely responsive way for desktop, mobile and even web assembly platforms in the future! According to [this discuss](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml) based on Qt Quick technology.\r\n3. This [concept of design](https://www.figma.com/file/GaCoOSNHB2yMB9ThiDtred/Bitcoin-Core-App-Main?node-id=1035%3A1883) designed by friends is very admirable and we can start developing it based on QML according to this concept. I prefer a single implementation of components for cross-platform and responsive UI. It is a better choice because:\r\n\r\n**This offer has advantages:**\r\n- Fast and comprehensive updates.\r\n- Fast improvement and avoiding waste of time on multi-platform development\r\n- Providing stable and reliable output on all platforms.\r\n\r\n4. Adding support for CMake tool as a fast and reliable tool. Build with CMake. Build with Confidence ([CMake](https://cmake.org/) slogan!). It helps us to provide fast and synchronized output on target platforms.\r\n5. Upgrading Interface codes to Qt6 and also core codes to C++20 in the future as a goal.\r\n6. It is important for me to pay attention to the support of new technologies such as web assembly (WASM).\r\n\r\nAt last, I thank my friends for their valuable efforts and hope that I can contribute to improve the project.\r\n\r\n_**Sincerely Kambiz!**_",

Build with Confidence (CMake slogan!). It helps us to provide fast and synchronized output on target platforms.\r\n\r\nOur build system, which is based on the Autotools, works just fine.
