Given that it seems to be fairly standard on the internet these days, is there a good reason that bitcoin should _not_ support resume-able block downloads? Could at least there be an option feature that can be supported, such that if I create a fork that does support this, that there can be a way to identify other peers which support it, without adding to the already unnecessary traffic that this proposed patch intends to reduce? I'd like to explore this, and would be happy for it not to enter the master branch (even though I think it would be an overall advantage if it eventually did).\n",

My internet connection disconnects connections at around the 300kB mark, so a 1MB block is often a problem unless download it via tor. I won't be the only person world-wide with such a connection to the bitcoin network but who also wants to run a full-node. I think bitcoin should support such users, and have yet to hear an argument why they should be excluded. Are there any disadvantages to including the ability to resume block downloads, for example?\n",

      "body": "@sipa - what is a decent user experience? With the changes I've made to my fork, I'm now downloading the blockchain much faster, but it's very inefficient in terms of bandwidth due to often downloading the same block from many peers, and often the connection breaking before the block completes. My proposals would fix both these issues. I'm regularly getting a memory pool of 400 or so between block updates, so I think my node is contributing to the network fine for transactions so far, just not so well for blocks until these changes can be implemented. (By the way, there is still a bug in my fork where it loses track of \"block providers\" and doesn't getblocks as early as it should - stil to fix).\n",

I'll probably completely separate the code for downloading blocks from the code for downloading txs. My thinking is that it can getblocks to a number of nodes and keep a list of the blocks discovered and who has them, then based on measurements it takes of network speed in general and individual speed of each connected peer, it can download a number of different blocks at once from different peers, keeping track of any peers that disconnect before a block is downloaded so that it knows to request it again, and keeping track of nodes that go quiet or get stuck, perhaps requesting the same block from more than one node, but keeping track of the sizes of blocks (revealed in the headers) so that it can tell if a previously quiet/stuck node starts to send a block it already has and can disconnect it to save the bandwidth of both peers. In order to reduce the chances of blocks of the same size, it will limit the number of getdata blocks to a smaller number than the existing 500.\n",
