Is the Linux kernel also that ugly in terms of include ordering, silly new-lines, wrong header naming in the ifdefs or as header end comments, wrong or missing indentations, wrong style for functions (where brackets aren't in a new line) etc... at least I've lost my motivation to contribute to that \"mess\" as even simple GUI pulls take forever to get in :-/.\n",

Bitcoin core code gets cleaner and not uglier IMO.\n\nI appreciate your cleanup pulls. But you often mix code-style changes with functional changes. That makes it hard(er) to review. And if you are working on other PRs, you need to decide if you do review one of your code-cleanup-PR or work on scalability-, feature- or refactoring-PRs. I think contributors often decide for the later.\n\nI would appreciate keeping \"drama\"-issues on a minimum. Working on a project like Bitcoin-Core requires extrem patience and a total focus on \"emotion-free\" tech-debate/contribution and discussions.\n",
