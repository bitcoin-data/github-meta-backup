    "body": "For both `getrawmempool true` and `getmempoolentry` it should probably have a field `effectivefeerate`.\r\n\r\nWhere as \"effective fee rate\" is defined as what miners sort transactions by (when taking into consideration the whole CPFP stuff).\r\n\r\nI need this field for when trying to create my own CPFP transactions, but it's quite difficult to calculate myself (especially as the mempool entries don't have a \"dependants\" field, so you need to dump the whole mempool, which currently takes me about ~26 seconds alone). \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis is useful for when trying to do something like CPFP as you want to know the pre-existing fee rate. The term I use in my code that deals with this is \"transaction cluster\" which might make a decent term. It could expose a \"clusterSize\" and \"clusterFee\"  so you can calculate the feerate (as well as know the total size of the cluster)\r\n  ",

Imagine if A had some other descendant, E, which has a much higher feerate than D.  Then A's effective feerate is actually determined by E, and B's effective feerate is determined only by B and D (since B no longer has to pay for A).\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in transaction B and willing to ignore the effect of descendants of B's ancestors on the effective feerate of B, then I think you could just look at all the descendants of B, and look at the max ancestor feerate of B and each of B's descendants.  Does that seem like it'd be good enough for your use cases?",

It'll make my code a little simpler, I won't need to dump the whole mempool. It's not ideal though, because I still need to:\r\n\r\ngetmempoolancestors on the transaction, and then loop over all the results with getmempooldescendants  to compile enough information.\r\n\r\n> Keep in mind that it's a bit tricky to exactly calculate the \"effective\" feerate of transaction B. \r\n\r\nYeah, it's annoying. That's why it should be provided by bitcoin :P\r\n\r\n> Does that seem like it'd be good enough for your use cases?\r\n\r\nNope :(  I really need to know exactly in order to do CPFP myself properly. \r\n\r\n",
