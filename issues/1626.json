    "title": "Raw transaction format not error robust",
    "body": "The current raw transaction format is not error-robust. Its trivial to corrupt transactions accidentally (e.g. accidentally dropping characters or adding characters when copy/pasting).\n\nThere are some use-case patterns where this could be quite dangerous.  I prepare a txn for you to pay me some coins you control... I give it to you.. You decode and from your perspective it looks fine, but a character got dropped.  You sign and transmit. Coins gone forever.\n\nThe hex strings are already inconveniently enormous. Sticking a CRC or a 64bits of a truncated hash on the end wouldn't be much additional burden (and if we cared about size at all we could make them much easier to handle if they used base64 instead like our signatures). \n\nThis would be a minor burden on application code, but its easily solved with a library and would close off a lot of mistakes and mischief. \n",

In either case the receiver only needs to buffer the crc state (e.g. if it could process the txn in a streaming fashion).\n\nThis does have some really vague applicability here: if I build some 8bit microcontroller based secure hardware signing dohicky... I may not have enough memory to buffer the whole output txn before printing it. Though I admit that this is somewhat fringe, but not entirely It's not uncommon for small secure devices to only have a few kb of memory.\n",

One-byte-changed errors seem extremely unlikely to me; what's the scenario where those creep into the JSON stream?\n\nMuch more likely are truncation/additional-character errors due to copy/paste.
