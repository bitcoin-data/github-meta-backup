      "body": "Thanks for creating this testing guide! I didn't have a chance to look at any of the detailled steps yet, but have a suggestion to add two other features to test. v25.0 will be the first release where Bitcoin Core takes internal use of the compact block filters (BIP158, enabled via `-blockfilterindex=1`), rather than only serving them to peers. There is on one hand a new RPC call `scanblocks` [1] which looks for blocks containing a certain set of passed descriptors by using block filters, and on the other hand a feature \"fast wallet rescan\" which automatically does the same for relevant output scripts belonging to a descriptor wallet to significantly speed-up wallet rescans.\r\n\r\nRelevant links:\r\n- `scanblocks` RPC: [original PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23549), [follow-up PR adding the option to filter out false-positives](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26325)\r\n- fast wallet rescan: [PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25957), [review club session](https://bitcoincore.reviews/25957), [simple idea how this could be tested](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/website/pull/554#issuecomment-1236931732)\r\n\r\n[1] this was easy to miss as it has only been added to the release notes recently: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27686#issuecomment-1560862446",

Mine was running in the background and was giving me failed to connect to any endpoint errors, calling `pkill bitcoind-test` resolves it but the experts in the chat think we should add to the guide calls to `bcli stop`.  \r\n\r\nstickies-v 12:02:47\r\nevansmj: cc abubakarsadiq yeah i think adding a `bcli stop` command at the end of every section that started with running bitcoind in `-daemon` mode makes sense \r\n\r\nabubakarsadiq Abubakar12:42:11\r\nYeah, to avoid such issues. I remember I had to pkill bitcoind which has to stop all my bitcoin nodes running, thanks for pointing that out evansmj, also thanks stickies-v for the ping\r\n\r\n",
