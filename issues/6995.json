    "title": "the RPC should have commands to specify the side of a fork considered 'current'",
    "body": "As bitcoin stands at the moment, a standard orphan race is decided simply by the first block received above the 'current' height - of course this process can continue if both forks grow at the same rate, but the concept and the solution are the same for multi-block forks up to a point\nWhen the orphan is resolved by the 'higher' block found, if that block is on a different valid fork to the what bitcoin considers the current fork, it will simply switch to the other fork.\n\nIt would be very useful to have an RPC command to switch which fork bitcoin considers is the current fork - probably by choosing the block hash at the top of the fork, if bitcoin knows multiple forks at the same height\nIn the case of network issues about choosing a fork, this would provide a very simple method to resolve which side of the fork a miner using bitcoin is mining on.\nThis would of course add complexity and require a different command if the fork chosen was at a lower level, but that could also be handled by being able to state that a specific block (in a fork) is invalid and should be ignored - and thus give a method to effectively invalidate the fork.\n\nI'm not sure what the RPC submitblock does with a block when it receives one, on or creating a different fork, but of course it would need to accept a block on a different fork if it doesn't already.\n",

      "body": "@laanwj thats a pretty dangerous suggestion (and the risk of miners doing that was a reason we considered leaving out out those RPCs in the first place)... because in the common case that the fork you heard first was the actual longer one if your software screws up and you fail to revalidate it, you'll continue on forking the network.\n\nThe normal reason for asks like this is because of a high-ish hashpower miner who found a tying block moments after they had already accepted a first longer block from the network (due to hardware and submission delays); and rather than accept their defeat gracefully they'd like to attempt a momentary majority hashpower attack and try to get lucky excluding the other block.   If you simulate this behavior of selfishly mining on your own later blocks, for many hashrate distributions and latency choices it gives _massively_ worse convergence times for the network. (I think for a toy example of two 50% miners and a 30 second submission latency it increased the frequency of 6+ deep reorgs 100 fold or something insane like that)\n\nPerhaps it would be better to focus more on cutting down on the submission latency side of it, since asking miners to not behave in a way thats adversarial towards the network may not be sustainable-- but historically many hardware vendors have not cared too much about eliminating these latencies. \n",

      "body": "@kanoi You mean me? As I was the big prodding force to get these in.  No-- I didn't say they shouldn't have been done, but rather we put them in knowing that the network was currently vulnerable to at the time non-public forking vulnerability (the one that just split PPC recently) and I was concerned that given the difficulty of contacting miners and the problems with reindexing that happened with the March 2013 fork we needed a tool available that would allow switching forks manually without reindexing, but couldn't even disclose the need.  Turns out they're _super_ useful for testing too.  \n\nBut now that they've been suggested for overriding the fastest convergence behavior that suggestion can't be taken back, and we need to provide a safe way of doing that (preferblock), because doing it via invalidate is not generally safe. Thats all, no big deal. Even 'preferblock' is not all that safe: as I mention, in many network typologies preferring your own blocks over tied earlier ones has really bad impacts on convergence; but we can't stop people from doing that. We can at least reduce provide a way that limits the harm to an increase in large reorgs rather than outright network forking.\n\nIn the case of f2pool, their bitcoind was on the correct chain; but other mining software which did not enforce any network validity rules was ignoring it and extending another chain because it had more blocks. This didn't help there.\n",

      "body": "PPC is some altcoin based on the bitcoin core codebase; and like most others hasn't kept up with fixes.\n\nIf miners prefer their own blocks over earlier received ones, then for many combinations of network topology and miner latency this results in significant increases in moderate depth to long reorgs. This is because in a near tie the winning block doesn't just have to win early enough to overcome network and validation latency and be heard uniformly before a competitor, it has to to that by more than the mining stack latency (which can be rather large). When that doesn't happen the fork persists when it otherwise would have resolved, and the result is a longer reorg. The effect is as big as it is, due to the exponential distribution of times between blocks means that a lot of blocks are 'fast'.\n\nThe comment here was not on that but that now that breaking ties with invalidation was suggested I think we really need to provide a better interface or get rid of the dangerous one---- we probably should have all along but it hadn't come up; even though it hurts convergence people will do it anyways and they might as well do it safely.  Though possible to do via invalidateblock it is quite tricky to get that right, and the result will be miners that refuse to mine on the longest chain even once theirs has fallen behind (e.g. due to state management and details like if they've invalidated they won't even see the longer extension, so they won't know they've fallen behind and will continue to try to mine a fork), which will leave lite clients more vulnerable to double spending and create other issues.  Since it sounds like people are going to do that we should provide an option (preferblock) which is less likely to shoot miners (and the network as a whole) in the foot and completely break things. :)\n",

As expected the 'inactive' fork became the active one (after a VERY long delay of about 4 miutes). However, I left it like that when another block arrived on the ...00005df7... fork to see what would happen - and indeed it stayed where it should have. 3 blocks later after 383295 appeared, I tried \"reconsiderblock ...00005df7...\" but it didn't correct the confirmation counts of a transaction in qt and \"getinfo\" still reported 383292 as the current block. Fortunately a bitcoind restart fixed it, so it must have been the internal state of bitcoind was messed up.\n\nReason for mentioning that here is so that anyone considering it should test it well before using it and might find it doesn't work.\n\nHowever, the important use of invalidateblock (to solve a network problem) seems to work ok.\n",
