    "title": "rpc: Logic errors and asserts in rpc code",
    "body": "Currently, we use `assert` in RPC code to document logic and code assumptions. However, it seems a bit extreme to abort all of Bitcoin Core on an assert failure in one of the RPC threads. I suggest to replace all checks with a macro `THROW_LOGIC_ERROR_IF_ASSERT_FAILS(condition)` that does what it says. That logic error will then be returned to the rpc caller and will include instructions to report the error to our issue tracker.\r\n\r\nAny objections or naming suggestions for that macro?",

I see logic errors and asserts as semantically equivalent, both indicating the presence of bugs, but logic_errors working better with unit tests. I think the suggested macro could be a good idea, because `if (cond) throw std::logic_error(strprintf(...))` is pretty verbose, and I think that discourages use. (Grepping for logic_error` I think every existing logic_error throw actually comes from me and no one other bitcoin developer has written one.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think it would be a good idea to ever catch `std::logic_error` outside of unit tests. I think that defeats the major advantage of logic_errors as logical assertions compatible with having good test coverage.\r\n\r\nIf the goal here is better isolation from nonfatal bugs in RPCs, I think I'd suggest instead defining a new `NonfatalError` class inheriting from `std::exception`, a `CHECK_NONFATAL` or similar macro throwing nonfatal error exceptions, and code to catch and handle those exceptions somewhere in the RPC framework.",

The only case I can think of is a rpc thread calling into validation and running into a database error, but then validation will take care of aborting the whole program.",

      "body": "Every time I have ever used `std::logic_error`, I've used it to mean that I've encountered a bug and I want the program to crash. If I found a bug and don't want the program to crash, I would use a different exception like `std::runtime_error` or a custom exception like the suggested `CHECK_NONFATAL` / `NonFatalCheckError`. Again, I think the nice thing about `logic_error` is that it can provide the same semantics as `assert` without getting in the way of unit test coverage. If we start catching `logic_error` exceptions then it loses those advantages because I no longer know what to expect when I throw it.\r\n\r\n> We already do that right now.\r\n\r\nlogic_error doesn't inherit from runtime_error, so I hope this isn't the case\r\n\r\n> There shouldn't be any fatal error in rpc code that would warrant a crash\r\n\r\nThis is subjective and is something reasonable people can disagree about. But I think it would be best for authors who add checks to clearly distinguish cases where they do and don't want crashes by using `assert` or `logic_error` in fatal cases, and `CHECK_NONFATAL` or `std::runtime_error` or similar in nonfatal cases.\r\n\r\nI'm fully onboard with your original suggestion to get rid of asserts in RPC code. All I'm suggesting is that instead of replacing them with `logic_error` throws, you replace them with something like `NonFatalCheckError` throws. You already proposed defining a custom `THROW_LOGIC_ERROR_IF_ASSERT_FAILS` macro, so I don't see what objection you would have to a shorter, clearer `CHECK_NONFATAL` macro instead.",

I don't think it'i a good idea to catch std::exception without rethrowing or exiting, but if we're already doing that, then there are fewer practical consequences to indiscriminately using `logic_error` for both fatal and nonfatal errors like you are suggesting. I still think it would be better for clarity to use a distinct exception type if you are going out of your way to define a new custom macro. But it does look like our current code is bad enough that using std::logic_error wouldn't be worse in a practical way right now.",
