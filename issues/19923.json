    "title": "Improve Tor support documentation",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI think we can add few things in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md to make it easier and better for users to use Bitcoin over Tor\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n1. Add few examples to run Bitcoin as onion service: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98913/how-to-run-bitcoin-core-as-onion-service-on-windows-ubuntu-and-android\r\n\r\n2. Add information about use of tor bridges and safe ways to connect over tor: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98772/what-are-the-safe-ways-to-connect-to-bitcoin-network-using-tor\r\n\r\n3. If we can't add everything in [tor.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md), maybe add more docs for separate platforms and issues. Example: `tor-win`, `tor-linux`, `tor-privacy`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI have tried to experiment, research and share things on https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com to discuss about tor related setups involved in using Bitcoin\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI am only suggesting few ideas based on my research and observation. I am sure people who use or build things related to Tor and more experienced than me are involved in Bitcoin so maybe we can improve the docs related to 'Tor Support'.\r\n",
