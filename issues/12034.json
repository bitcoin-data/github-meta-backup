    "title": "Hash Graph - Applied to BTC?",
    "body": "Is it possible to make a hard fork of Bitcoin that implements Hash Graph? Is this legal as Hash Graph is proprietary licensed? Even though the license does not agree with open source, the algorithm is open and potentially could be implemented while still giving value to \"old\" crypto currency tokens and keys.\r\n\r\nBitcoin to scale to billions if not trillions of transactions per second.\r\n\r\nIt is known that Bitcoin has a scaling problem. 6 transactions per second is not enough to sustain a global economy. Lightning promises to solve this but it's still not implemented fully?!\r\n\r\nI transferred a small amount of BTC to Ethereum and it took several days on a small priority.\r\n\r\nJust a simple Wallet (Coinomi).\r\n\r\nHave installed a full Bitcoin wallet but tried also easier to use implementations such as Jaxx and Coinomi.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to do some coding as I am a programmer, but haven't had any notable experience with implementing crypto algorithms before. However, I have plenty of experience implementing algorithms.\r\n\r\nNo debug log at this time.",
