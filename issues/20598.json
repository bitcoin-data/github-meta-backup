    "body": "One user reported the issue on Bitcoin SE: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/100437/bitcoin-cli-0-19-1-wallet-not-sending-from-addresses-with-closest-amount\r\n\r\n_UTXO A_ : 0.5 BTC\r\n_UTXO B-Z_ : 0.5 BTC\r\n\r\n_UTXO B-Z_ are selected instead of _UTXO A_ as the input for the transaction if I try to pay someone 0.5 BTC or more. Size of transaction is increased so user has to pay _more fees_. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n_UTXO A_ should be selected as input automatically which will decrease the size of transaction and fees.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduce the issue by following below steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create 850 addresses in bitcoin core: `for ($i=1; $i -le 850; $i++) {.\\bitcoin-cli.exe getnewaddress}`\r\n\r\n2. Add random amounts similar to the transaction mentioned by user in the issue: `81e681e4d7ed58a7645b3d8ae38c584e14954c359e3db8788b5ef645d65e9e64`\r\n\r\n   CSV file with address and amounts: https://mega.nz/file/ixsyjDYC#19Ff2qZP7LQjCvhz4ISF84uESPBesWrZmMVngJWGMOk\r\n\r\n3. Create, Sign and Broadcast a transaction to one of the address in my bitcoin core wallet using above CSV file from electrum wallet\r\n\r\n   Tx: https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/b5c6c6dd204420020795fbf356d4db85a9398dbd99e575c72b76ec5f8d8d78e2\r\n\r\n4. Send 0.54 BTC in one more transaction to my bitcoin core wallet: \r\n\r\n   https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/37675b6d44d1fe1b8095349f5d08d12197cee76504a0da6b0ab99fb29a4fa176\r\n\r\n5. Finally we have a similar setup in bitcoin core to reproduce the issue. Try to send 0.49 BTC to some address and very small amounts to few other addresses by creating a transaction in bitcoin core wallet as the user did in tx mentioned on SE: https://i.imgur.com/utWKiZN.png\r\n\r\n    https://i.imgur.com/WtduQx8.png\r\n\r\n6. If I do not use \"coin control features\" and inputs are selected automatically:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/101463156-12823200-3963-11eb-84e6-b0dc22d50019.png)\r\n\r\n7. If use \"coin control features\" and select [UTXO with 0.54 BTC](https://i.imgur.com/0sBn3wE.png):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/101463464-77d62300-3963-11eb-9605-e55f1addcf8a.png)\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core v 0.20.0\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nStill trying to understand how [Coin Selection Algorithm](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1077/what-is-the-coin-selection-algorithm) works, why it didn't select `tb1qztazgd5665j9q0ww7qw24ms42gny6vc2h3z5yg` as input automatically and how can we fix this.\r\n\r\nThe user has mentioned on SE: \r\n> I have a feeling that coin control favors more inputs with less combined \"change\" over less inputs with more combined change. In this case the change address (3BF5VhQgnabWMsB8QhVrBoWD6is2XMKuQs) received 0.00008051 BTC, where the input with the closest full amount amount would have resulted in (0.02544158 - tx fee) in change\r\n",

      "body": "In general, our coin selection algorithm does not currently consider the fee that each input will require when it does the selection. The exception is the first Branch and Bound pass that we do. This pass will attempt to find a solution without change at all, and it does consider the fee paid in its selection. This could result in an input set that is very large but produces no change. However that is not the case here. Further selection attempts (when BnB fails) will attempt to create a minimum change amount of 0.01 BTC, although it may fail to do so and make smaller change. There is no preference for smaller change at this stage because smaller change means that UTXOs will tend to be broken down into dust.\r\n\r\nThe fallback selection method includes randomness and will somewhat randomly choose different UTXOs for inclusion, although it is not a true random selector. I believe that if you run this experiment many times, eventually one of the results will have lower fees and choose the largest input. Due to the large number of UTXOs in this wallet, various iteration limits may be run into here so a less optimal solution may be chosen.\r\n\r\nLastly, always choosing a lowest fee input set always degenerates into the largest first case which is not ideal. Largest first selection is not healthy for the wallet as over time it grinds UTXOs into dust which causes future transactions to pay even higher fees.",

      "body": ">In general, our coin selection algorithm does not currently consider the fee that each input will require when it does the selection.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't look right approach considering lot of users and projects might be trusting the algorithm to provide the best selection for them while creating a transaction. In this case it is a business that does the transactions for users so I am assuming a lot of transactions are overpaying from years for transactions that could have been done with less fees.\r\n\r\n> There is no preference for smaller change at this stage because smaller change means that UTXOs will tend to be broken down into dust.\r\n\r\nStill trying to read the code, experiment with wallet and understand what role does \"change\" play in this and how does it affect selecting inputs with more fees involved. Maybe will get some clarity by morning.\r\n\r\n> I believe that if you run this experiment many times, eventually one of the results will have lower fees and choose the largest input. \r\n\r\nThis does not help the users and projects who are trusting the algorithm and creating transactions with whatever results they get first time.\r\n\r\n> Largest first selection is not healthy for the wallet as over time it grinds UTXOs into dust which causes future transactions to pay even higher fees.\r\n\r\nAgree but in this case it might have helped especially if we had some warning messages or hints included in the RPC commands `createrawtransaction` or `fundrawtransaction` results. \r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n1. The user tries to create a transaction with inputs automatically selected. Algorithm added inputs. Size: 54kB Fees: 0.0135 BTC and there is a warning message: \"You can save fees by selecting other input(s). Size: 0.48kB Fees: 0.00012 BTC\"\r\n\r\n2. If the user doesn't care about fees he can go ahead and sign this transaction to broadcast it later.\r\n\r\n3. If the user wants to save fees he should be able to create transaction with other input. Algorithm should be smart enough to suggest such things for users who trust bitcoin core.\r\n\r\n4. We can also add additional information in the warning messages: Links to know about UTXO consolidation, Best Practices to save fees, Segwit addresses benefits etc.\r\n\r\n5. This user could have done the transaction with bigger input to save fees and also not wait for days to get the transaction confirmed as its related to business. Time and Money matters a lot for businesses. They are trusting bitcoin core algorithms to help them.\r\n\r\n6. Later the user could have done UTXO consolidation when mempool is clear with 1sat/vByte to get all the small amount UTXOs in to one. This would again require less fees but might have to wait for hours/days which can be considered a planned maintenance with preparation.\r\n\r\n7. If warning messages are not possible or won't help most of the users, can we have one option in `bitcoin.conf` to enable priority for coin selection like `spendzeroconfchange` and `txconfirmtarget` ? Maybe: `coinselection=1` for privacy, `coinselection=2` for fees, `coinselection=3` for dust and by default it will work as its working right now. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> best selection\r\n\r\nAnd how is \"best\" defined? There is no clear definition of what is best because there are so many variables involved in coin selection.\r\n\r\n> Example:\r\n\r\nProviding so much additional information to users generally makes a bad user experience, especially for users who don't know how transactions and transaction fees work. I don't think it would be good to do be suggesting alternatives and telling users to study all this other stuff. The point of having a software manage UTXOs and make transactions is to abstract all of that away from the user. You end with with decision paralysis or users choosing some \"obvious\" thing without understanding the nuance. I'm certain that if you presented the option for users to have a \"prefer lower fees\" coin selection, the vast majority of users would pick that and not realize that doing so will create a degenerate wallet in the long run.\r\n\r\nI agree that coin selection should be better. But all of that takes work and requires review. And it most certainly won't happen quickly. Few people understand coin selection to review changes to it. Few people are willing to review coin selection code. We have to make it understandable first before any material changes to the algorithms can be done. I currently have 3 coin selection PRs open that address some issues: #20040, #17331, #17526. I have additional branches based on those which make it much easier to understand coin selection, so hopefully we can begin working on other material changes to the algorithms.",

      "body": "@prayank23 thank you for submitting this issue and for your input thus far.\r\n@achow101 thanks for clarifying a few things as well. I am the user with this issue/concern so I thought I would add my bit as well.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree the \"best selection\" is relative, there has to be a way to balance using UTXOs with small fees and using UTXOs with closest available amount, as well as change. I'm not entirely sure why change is considered bad, I may be missing something.\r\n\r\nI run a business where a lot of our transactions are between $10-$20. We do a fair amount of transactions over $100 and a very few over $1,000. We never send out more than we have received on a single transaction.\r\n\r\nIn 2017 we decided to use senttomany and consolidate all our sends to every 4 hours instead of sending to a single address every time an escrow is released or refunded so that we can reduce the fees. That did help, but over the past 5 months we have sent out 8 transactions where each cost 0.01 - 0.05 BTC in fees. The total amount for the 8 transactions was 2.1511 BTC and the total fee was 0.18 BTC.\r\nThis should not happen considering all the sent amount had been received (plus 2.5%-5% explained below) to different addresses.\r\n\r\nIf coin selection was selecting the inputs with the closes amounts to the amount being sent, then all my addresses would be within 2.5% - 5% from that amount. The 2.5%-5% is the fee being deducted from the amount we send back out. For example, if we receive 0.5 BTC to an address, then we would expect to send out 0.475 - 0.4875 BTC back out within 30 days (in most cases within 10 days).\r\n\r\nIf the transactions were personal, then this would never be a problem. It would take a lot of effort to build up a 1,000 input wallet for personal use. But businesses can run into this issue a lot more frequently. We have around 2,500 new inputs a month.\r\n\r\nIf there was a way to set a flag to set a max input per transaction where the desired amount can be reached then it would help businesses put a \"stop loss\" on fees so that a single transaction fee doesn't blow up the way some of ours did.\r\n\r\nI know this is a far chance, but is there a way to consolidate inputs automatically every x days/weeks? I tried researching and what I found was too fiddly and cannot be automated. \r\n\r\nThe transactions are below for reference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfee | txid | time\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n-0.03600705 | 81e681e4d7ed58a7645b3d8ae38c584e14954c359e3db8788b5ef645d65e9e64 | 4/12/2020 15:00\r\n-0.01397923 | ad1e27699b5ee4fb71029e4fcff4170919846a324bf5a980085aa00fa9c5b400 | 5/11/2020 23:00\r\n-0.01690541 | 0def8fa0066760e5d7bb7a6bc4d1c4e6c0575a817509695862e8d0e1f9aa12a9 | 27/10/2020 19:00\r\n-0.01078708 | d77eeb378fd757437cb717cf9262de0a715a6b494027c1b20a77fb945c2e360f | 10/09/2020 18:00\r\n-0.01714392 | a5e0ca1763c3d077229d7e71e81f18e234293fb8811f46fe18549d2531b81d9a | 7/09/2020 23:10\r\n-0.01011056 | b9b981e6f90e9f3fd0f692280a47aa71c23cb1d2387d9610c5bbc39a0c9f0f71 | 28/07/2020 22:00\r\n-0.02339042 | ee86fbe4db58131b3347cda1fc2691ab8a7c31c458a7adb64a82bc5f09c3dac3 | 22/07/2020 22:00\r\n-0.0517428 | 01ed3e118c81c3a3b837abfbfa97ae095deecf3105ddd36d4d1cace66d1d1b73 | 22/07/2020 21:59\r\n-0.18006647 |   |  ",

Bitcoin Core's coin selection will prefer a smaller input set at high feerates to reduce cost and a bigger input set at low feerates to aid in consolidation. At 1 sat/vB Bitcoin Core will prefer a larger input set, so it was probably pure chance that you got a small transaction in the last attempt. If you'd like to test whether it's now more thrifty in cases as described by the asker on SE, you need to build your transaction at a higher feerate (like the mentioned 46 sat/vB).",
