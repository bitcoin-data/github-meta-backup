      "body": "Thanks again for the answer. I have tried to implement the PR locally, unfortunately we do still not connect the old nodes (<0.13.x without NODE_WITNESS), even when I add their IPs to chainparamsseeds.h. Now that our target is to gracefully upgrade our servers and nodes behind the firewall, so the only chance I currently see is to run some \"gateway nodes\" on 0.13 until the whole cluster is up to date. On the global network this might not be a big deal as there are still a lot of intermediate versions around, locally it would isolate the older ones.",
