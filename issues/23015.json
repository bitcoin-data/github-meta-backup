      "body": "> While the server part of the RPC server isn't fuzzed, the RPC methods are fuzzed in the `rpc` target.\r\n\r\nWow, the [RPC fuzz target](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e69cbac628bfdca4a8e4ead821190eaf5b6b3d07/src/test/fuzz/rpc.cpp) is very interesting! It is just calling whitelisted RPC methods with random arguments. It wouldn't be hard to write the same test for a list of whitelisted IPC methods, since capnp does provide enough introspection to query method arguments and fill them with random values. So given a list of whitelisted methods,, the IPC fuzz test could randomly call whitelisted methods with random argument values, and even randomly fill recursive data structures.\r\n\r\nSince a test like this would be calling capnp methods directly, it would not provide fuzz coverage for the C++ wrapper methods which call the corresponding capnp methods. These wrapper methods don't do very much, but are responsible for things like converting `CFeeRate` objects to and from streams of bytes, converting C++ vectors and maps to and from capnp lists. Separate fuzz tests could be written for this type conversion code, although from discussion https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22962#issuecomment-921744922 it sounds like neither of us thinks this coverage would be very useful? There is no equivalent of this fuzzing for our RPC code just because we only provide an RPC server, not an RPC client (we don't have C++ methods that help call corresponding RPC methods remotely).\r\n\r\n> I guess fuzzing multiprocess is hard to fuzz because there is no logic to fuzz, it is just an interface for other logic.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true for the RPC server. There should be little difference between IPC and RPC from a fuzzer's point of view. If you wanted to tweak the RPC fuzz test to only fuzz test the RPC server and skip actual execution of the RPC methods, you could do that. Equivalently, you can test the IPC server with IPC method execution, or the IPC server without IPC method execution.\r\n\r\nI will say overall I don't have good intuition for what type of fuzzing is useful, and what type of fuzzing is not useful, and what the costs and benefits are for different kinds of fuzzing. I would love to read a simple guide that told me what fuzzing best practices are (and maybe told me how fuzzing works, because that is also largely a black box to me). But before that happens, I am happy to write whatever fuzzing test someone tells me to write.",
