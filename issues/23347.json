    "title": "question: PoissonNextSend not poisson distribution?",
    "body": "If this is a known quirk of Bitcoin's networking code, please feel free to close and I'm sorry for the spam.\r\n\r\nFrom [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) a poisson distribution has `mean = λ` and `variance = λ` (so `std dev = sqrt(λ)`). I ran `PoissonNextSend` 10000 times in a unit test and calculated the mean and std dev of the returned result. I received a mean of λ and a std dev of λ each time. So when passing in 30s, the mean was 30s and the std dev was 30s (and I did remember to take the square root here!). My calculations of the `unscaled` variable give a mean & std. dev of 1. I was wondering if this is intentional since the \"textbook definition\" means this is not a poisson distribution.",
