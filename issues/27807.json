There should be a way to remove the prioritization entirely and set it to zero without calling two separate RPCs.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nIf a miner wants to deprioritize a transaction then they need to call two RPC methods instead of just one which would simplify things\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd new RPC deprioritisetransaction(txid) this will set the delta to 0 and remove the txid from the delta map\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nChange prioritisetransaction(txid, 0, fee_delta=0) (may cause breakage)\r\nwhere if fee_delta=0 then we set the delta to zero instead of modifying it 0\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nAdd new param prioritisetransaction(txid, 0, fee_delta(optional), hardset_delta(optional))\r\nWhere now fee_delta and hardset_delta are both optional but at least one is needed\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nThis idea mentioned here towards the end in PR review club\r\nhttps://bitcoincore.reviews/27501\r\n\r\nRelated PR\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27501",
