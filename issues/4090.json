    "body": "H Gavin. \n\nReally hope you get to read this and the subsequent email I sent:\n\nHi Gavin\n\nMy name is Andrew van der Nest from Cape Town South Africa. \nI run the Bitcoin Cape Town Meetup as well CEO of the soon to be established South African Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nAt our last meetup we raised the issue of lost coins through neglect or hardware issues (failed drive etc). We subsequently solved the issue in the following way:\n\nThe Bitcoin network needs to validate wallets every 6 - 12 months.\nWallets that are not verified would then be destroyed and those coins allocated back to the network to be mined again ensuring the 21 million are always in circulation. The challenge is there are of course a lot of wallets out there as well as many online (guessing the QT wallet would be a bit easier). However the blockchain does of course have all address in it and would be a source of information. If there way a way to download all wallet addresses the task may be a lot easier.\n\nKnow this is way easier said than done but I think this is something the team should consider working on as it is a real problem that requires a solution.\n\nRegards,\nAndy\n",

The market will compute it in. On a macro scale it is not an issue.\n\nYes, on the other hand, I _am_ concerned with sob stories of the users that lose bitcoins, and I encourage developments that improve robustness and security of wallets. The protocol already has features such as multisig that can help here.\n\nIn general, github is not for vague proposals for bitcoin, but for concrete changes to the implementation \"Bitcoin Core\". Hence I suggest moving this elsewhere, like the forums. But first do a thorough Google search - as said, this has been discussed many times.\n",

Furthermore, it would require every single node to agree with the change and upgrade. I do not consider that viable. It's a decision you can make when the currency is introduced, but changing it afterwards is breaking assumptions of people who chose using it earlier.\n\nThere is also no risk to the system- a small percentage of coins will always be lost. If that ever becomes a problem, a different change (increasing the precision of amounts) which does not break the social contract is always possible (but would still require massive support).\n",

      "body": "> Wallets that are not verified would then be destroyed and those coins allocated back to the network to be mined\n\nNotwithstanding the other excellent comments about as to why this class of proposals appears to be a non-starter in Bitcoin,  this specific proposal as a even greater flaw than the the general class: It radically screws up the miner incentives.  By directly returning the coins to mining miners are incentivized to refuse to mine near-expiration transactions in the hopes that they won't make it in in-time and will expire— \"near\" doesn't have a bright line distinction, it's just whatever they can get away with. As a result I don't think this proposal would be very advisable in any crypto-currency, not just Bitcoin.\n\nOne problem with the \"market will just price the loss in\" is that the market currently can't distinguish loss from just inactivity, so that creates growing uncertainty about the supply. This could be answered by the simpler approach of just making long unmoved coins unmovable, which has less incentive problems— though it's still probably completely Bitcoin incompatible.\n",

      "body": "@laanwj Right thats one of the applications for a OP_CHECKTIMELOCKVERIFY opcode (https://people.xiph.org/~greg/OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.patch). You have an OP_IF and in the branch you have a timelock verify and a different set of keys to sign for the coin. Though its a bit inefficient to always have to sign including that data.\n\nAnother alternative for 'inheritance keys' is to simply always create timelocked spends of your coins whenever you receive them. I've thought this might be an interesting wallet feature, to automatically create timelocked spends of your coin so that if you don't spend them by a certain time they'll go to selected friends/family/charities. (Friends/family having an advantage that perhaps they can give them back to you if you're still around and merely lost your wallet).\n",

If that ever becomes a problem we can add extra digits to amounts with just about the same technical difficulty as your suggestion, but way less controversial.\n",

      "body": "I am not a Coder, but a committed investor and Trader in crypto currencies, mainly as a hedge against other investments - since Bitcoin parity with gold in February / March 2017. I have no loyalty to any main Holder of Value coin, or Altcoin, But would like to see BTC become the main Holder of Value which it deserves to be, because of its White Paper (motives of Satoshi Nakamoto holding a lot of Bitcoin are not explicitly considered here).\r\n\r\nI think @AndyCapeTown raises an incredibly important issue which is critical to mainstream adoption for a Holder of Value crypto. I imagine it is relatively easy for a fork of Bitcoin, to ensure full Monetary Supply control, via the recycling of dead wallets. A fork that does this may be the prerequisite for all Blockchains in the future. I think BTC is vulnerable to being \"outforked\". We have the technology to have full Monetary Supply control, it seems crazy not to use it.\r\n\r\nI am not factoring general improvements of usability through cold storage wallets, or other USPs such as fully private blockchains, which also could make BTC vulnerable to a more competitive Holder of Value. \r\n\r\nBenefits of Dead Wallet Recycling:\r\na) 2 year lag on unverified wallets - Monetary Supply will be assured \r\n(physically accessing a wallet could be enough to ping verification within 2 years of first balance?)\r\n\r\nb) Estate Management workarounds have to be arranged by Crypto Holders in the event of death\r\n(Could a decentralised register of Births and Deaths be used so that a SMART contract triggers the \r\nmovement of wallet funds as per Will Instructions?)\r\n\r\nc) Recycling of dead wallets could be an economic tool to fairly redistribute wealth to all individuals\r\n(there is a lot of evidence that the 1% (fraction of the 1%?) are just getting richer in real terms since the high mark of Social Mobility in the 1970s in the UK at least, and neo liberal economics of the 1980s which have just increased \"Rent Seeking\" in multiple markets, which distributed ledgers can correct to 0-1% - the current legacy system is biased, see certified Cognitive Biases on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)\r\n\r\nd i) Pre Mined Fork with 90% of satoshis could be allocated to all individuals fairly\r\n(A United Nations Coin, UN Coin, could fork off Bitcoin and do this?)\r\nd ii) Immense Market Accumulation by Whales would be prevented \r\n(early BTC adopter wealth may not be tolerated by the majority that are not in Crypto)\r\n\r\nf) Geopolitical stability assured through decentralised global finance management era \r\n(immense financial volatility as legacy system and debt needs to be accounted in decentralised alternatives[would it be written off?], if Cryptos go past 50% of total Money Supply on an S-Curve. This implies that there will only be 1 Holder of Value that succeeds? The problem of Quantitative Easing / Printing Money by Central Banks and becoming Whales in Crypto needs considering).\r\n\r\nWell done to Andrew van der Nest for raising such a critical point so many years ago, it is sad to see it being dismissed as a Forum discussion. Perhaps the Bitcoin Developers need to employ economists to advise them? I would not be surprised if the Main Holder of Value mantle moves to another coin via outforking BTC.\r\n\r\nIn terms of usability of Crypto, I think there are a few more iterations needed for hardware wallets until they are ready for main stream adoption - too many software updates at the moment, and some are almost unusable.\r\n\r\nThe problem of theft / hostaging holders needs some thought regarding securing funds, point d) above would remove this as an issue.",
