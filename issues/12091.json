Do we know yet what the implications are for Bitcoin Core? Will we just need to recompile release binaries with a compiler that supports the mitigations?",

      "body": "@bolekC From my understanding of Spectre, the attack is towards a specific process and its memory. The examples given in the paper are towards the kernel, but AFAIU, it is not limited to just the kernel. In fact the PoC given in the paper does not do anything with the kernel at all.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise is to give a process some untrusted input which it then does input validation before allowing execution to proceed. The attack makes use of speculative execution that is performed before the input is fully validated in order to leak data from that process's memory. So no, it is not an attack on the kernel and it does require user applications to have mitigation in place in order to avoid the application from having its secrets leaked.\r\n\r\nSpectre requires knowing specific memory locations of data in the application, having memory in the user application that the external application can access and measure timings for, and knowing exactly what the code is doing. The third part is trivially achievable with open source applications.",

      "body": "Compiler mitigations aren't useful for us:  The attack requires an indirect jump that runs inside the target address space which can be precisely stimulated by the attacker, _any_ indirect jump. If Bitcoin were compiled with special flags, that would still leave libraries-- the whole system would need to be compiled with it.  [I'm also skeptical that these mitigations will have acceptable performance too-- speculation across indirect jumps is a big part of why they perform well enough that they're acceptable]\r\n\r\nMoving signing into another process would likely have the effect of denying an attacker the ability to stimulate an indirect jump on demand, so it would be useful.\r\nThe slowness of spectre is probably irrelevant, a few thousand bits per second would read a 256 bit private key pretty darn quickly-- even if it has to read a half dozen addresses first to find it.\r\n\r\nCapping decryption time would be penny wise and pound foolish, then parties that want long decryption times would just not encrypt at all, creating insecurity for common cases in exchange for maybe being somewhat more secure in uncommon cases. Please no. Keep in mind that local exploit vectors are MUCH MUCH MUCH more common than remote ones; if an attacker can run enough local code to use spectre then you're probably already in trouble. \r\n\r\nKeeping the keys themselves out of memory might be a worthwhile mitigation without much cost. They can be kept out of memory even if the wallet is unlocked. \r\n\r\n",
