    "title": "Add examples in tor.md",
    "body": "_What?_\r\n\r\n[doc/tor.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md) : Add examples of using Bitcoin Core onion service in Linux(Ubuntu), Mac, Windows and Android \r\n\r\n_Why?_\r\n\r\n1. **Make it easier** for newbies and power users to try Bitcoin Core onion service\r\n2. Users should not search for proper documentation in different websites, forums, blogs etc. and everyone should be able to follow the things easily using **doc in this repository**. **Privacy** should not be hard to achieve or at least the first steps should be easy and encouraging enough to motivate the user in learning more later.\r\n3. The examples will help in **skipping all the things** mentioned in doc. Run the commands and setup Bitcoin Core Onion Service in **few minutes**. Once the user can see that onion address and things working it will motivate him to read all the things mentioned in doc if interested to research more.\r\n4. [Tor usage in Bitcoin Core](https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/?days=730) is 20-30%, I am sure everyone contributing in this repository wants to see this **number go up**. I personally want this to be above 50%. Using Bitcoin Core with Tor should be the default.\r\n\r\n_How?_\r\n\r\n1. I tried [adding 1 example for Ubuntu](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21157) to start with, however it looked like duplication of few things that were already mentioned in doc. So had to give up and look for other ways to add examples. ‚ùå\r\n2. I would prefer adding screenshots with the basic steps. I don't think people will agree to add screenshots in [doc/tor.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md) so the options are:\r\n\r\n   2.1 Create a separate file for examples\r\n   2.2 Enable wikis for the repository and create a page\r\n   2.3 <mark>Add all examples in one Q&A on Bitcoin Stackexchange and use its link ü§î\r\n   2.4 None of the above\r\n3. How would the examples look like? [Basic steps](https://twitter.com/prayankgahlot/status/1407349275940605952) for [Operating Systems](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide) that are used more for desktop and mobile(Android).\r\n\r\nCc: @Rspigler\r\n\r\n",

(Definitely 1,2, and 4 under `Why`, maybe not 3).\r\n\r\nRe: `How` - I think this will be hard to process without seeing all 3 OS examples at one time, as seeing just the linux example looked like duplication.  Even with all 3, maybe we will want to remove the general installation instruction as we are adding specific instructions later in the document (or will the installation instructions come first? - See point 3 under `Why`)\r\n\r\nI agree with @jonatack That screenshots shouldn't be used - they don't work perfectly for each user, and they make the document too long IMO.  As for his second point, hopefully tutorials start to point official docs.\r\n",
