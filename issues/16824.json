    "title": "Crash dumps from bitcoin-qt contain wallets",
    "body": "On a crash, bitcoin-qt may dump a core file that contains what was in memory at the time of the crash, for debugging purposes.  The problem here is that bitcoin-qt stores the user's wallet.dat unencrypted in memory.  With this information it becomes rather trivial to reconstruct parts of a user's wallet.dat from a .core dump alone.  You can find the wallets within the core file simply by grepping for known parts of a wallet.dat ex: `xxd bitcoin-qt.core | grep \"6231 0500\"`  With this information you can find the offset of the wallet within the core file, and reconstruct it per a known wallet.dat's length.  Upon reloading the extracted wallet into bitcoin-qt, you'll lose address book information - but balance is retained.  **This has been assigned CVE-2019-15947**.\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/oxagast/50a121b2df32186e0c48411859d5861b\r\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15947\r\n",

Crash dumps by design contain the entire address space, which might contain private keys. \r\n\r\nMaybe there is a flag that could be set to disable crash dumps by default for the program?\r\n\r\nAnyhow, there's a best-effort attempt to clear decrypted keys after use, if your wallet.dat is encrypted, see use of `memory_cleanse`. Even this can never be 100% effective as the application might crash at any time. If your wallet.dat is not encrypted, then parts of that file (including raw private keys) might be cached and are part of the memory and it's fully expected.",
