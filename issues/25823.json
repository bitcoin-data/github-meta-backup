For example the first issue (a feature request) has been closed: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1 . Generally I think it makes sense to drop off feature requests after a few years of inactivity. Inactivity can mean that no one wants the feature, or the feature doesn't make sense, or the implementation is impossible/too hard.\r\n\r\nIf there was a rule to keep all feature request open forever, it would be impossible to browse the issues list for bugs (including security related ones). The number of bugs a program can have is limited, however the number of features one can request are unlimited.\r\n\r\n> 3 letter agencies keeping an eye on this repository for privacy and security related issues. Closing them doesn't improve anything.\r\n\r\nI am not aware of a security related issue that was closed without a valid rationale and without a fix. Issues are closed on a case-by-case basis, and if needed they can also be re-opened on a case-by-case basis. Also, keep in mind that a closed issue doesn't mean the discussion has been banned from the repo forever. No one is holding anyone back to request an issue to be reopened, or create a new issue (maybe with additional context, or a summary of previous issues, or with history/recent changes relevant to the issue elaborated).",
