    "body": "It seems to me that the usefulness of multisig addresses are severely limited if the current client implementation doesn't support showing received payments to a multisig address unless one has all the keys imported into their wallet.\n\nI understand why it may be considered dangerous to show received payments if they aren't spendable (the wallet doesn't have all the required keys for the multisig address) but at the same time that is exactly the point of using multisig addresses.\n\nIt seems any rpc calls dealing with transactions (`listsince`, `listtransactions`, etc) should at least have an extra option to show transactions sent to multisig addresses that have been added with `addmultisigaddress` (ismine: true) even if all the keys haven't been imported into the wallet.\n",

      "body": "Yes, that's essentially what the wallet code does for transactions it cares about.\n\nNote that 3) can be done with one \"batch\" RPC call, so it's not as inefficient as you might think.\n\nWhat is your use case where you might be getting payments on multisig addresses where you don't control all of the keys and aren't told via some way other than the blockchain the transaction ID of a new, incoming payment? The use cases I can think of all involve negotiation between the people who hold the keys, and I assume that the transaction id would be included in that negotiation (in which case you use getrawtransaction/signrawtransaction to spend).\n\nThe multi-device wallet will definitely require a new type of 'ismine' key, where it IS yours, but one of the private keys is on another device that you own (and when that is implemented I assume listtransactions/etc will show those payments).\n",

      "body": "I would like to use multisig addresses for customer deposits. I was planning on having the server that watches for incoming deposits have one key and then there would be at least one other key stored elsewhere that would be needed to process withdrawals. In this type of scenario you control all the keys, but they aren't in one place. What would be the use of multisig addresses if all the keys are in one wallet?\n\nIn my scenario you could ask a customer for a transaction id, but it does make it more complicated than just asking them to make a deposit to a bitcoin address as normally is done.\n\nThanks for pointing out the batch rpc calls, I didn't think of that. I think the best thing to do would be to add a new flag to `addmultisigaddress` that will set the new `ismine` flag that you are talking about to true and then `listtransactions`, `listsince`, etc will show them\n",

Right now if the multisig address received several transactions, you have to handle the calculations yourself, and bitcoin client already solved that for plain addresses.\n",
