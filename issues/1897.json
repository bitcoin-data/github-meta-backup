    "body": "Currently if one wants to get info about what is happening in bitcoind, one needs to poll various parameters - checking the balance per account, checking for new transactions and so forth.\n\nI propose adding some JSON push notifications coming from bitcoind to some predefined http address. This approach would let one's application communicating with bitcoind to know about all the latest events from the program without having to poll it often. Some sample notifications could include:\n- New Tx appearing in the wallet with 0, 6 and other number of confirmations\n- New block appearing in the blockchain\n- A block being replaced in the blockchain\n- Balance changing in some account with 0, 6... confirmations\n",

It is trivial to combine it with curl to get a \"send block information to a URL when there is a new block.\"\n\nWith some programming you can keep track of 1/6-confirm transactions using it.\n\nFor monitoring transactions, -txnotify would be easy but forking a new process every time there is a new transaction is almost certainly not the right way to go, but maybe it would work if it was rate-limited to only notifying at most once every N seconds.\n\nI wrote a monitorblock/tx patch a long time ago, but fell out of love with it-- it was a lot of extra code to maintain, and it is really easy to get feature creep (if you support notifying https: URLs then you suddenly have to deal with certificate chains and expired certificates, you have to figure out what to do if there is an error communicating with the website, etc etc).\n\nThe bloom filter work that is just about ready to merge is also very relevant.\n",

I have a pullrequest for GBT longpolling open, but I don't know how well it would work for events in general (seems too easy to miss an event). Chunked encoding could be used to simply stream data, but I think most clients won't give you anything until it's all received. Not sure how complex websockets are...\n",
