    "body": "## As with btcsuite/btcd, gcash also supports walle and Lightning Network clients, and will be developed actively.\r\n\r\n### The following is the latest release:\r\n\r\n- Adjust pow difficulty algorithm strictly following bitcoin-ABC Specific details: [https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/nov-13-hardfork-spec.md](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/nov-13-hardfork-spec.md)\r\n  - The new difficulty adjustment algorithm activited since Height: `504031` for mainnet\r\n  - Adjust the order of handing orphan block in `ProcessBlock` function because the next block's difficulty \r\n    calculation depends on the previous block after the new rules activating\r\n    Detail: [https://github.com/bcext/gcash/blob/master/blockchain/process.go#L196-L227](https://github.com/bcext/gcash/blob/master/blockchain/process.go#L196-L227)\r\n- Adjust signature digest algorithm via setting `SigHashForkID` Detail:[https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/replay-protected-sighash.md](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/replay-protected-sighash.md)\r\n  - At this version, `gcash` supports the new and old signature digest algorithm depending on \r\n    `ScriptFlags`\r\n  - All new signature digest algorithm unit testings were checked strictly and passed\r\n- Support base32 bitcoin cash address encoding same to bitcoin-ABC\r\n  Detail: [https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/cashaddr.md(https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/cashaddr.md)\r\n  - `gcash` and `cashwallet` use base32 address format default. But the added rpc command can convert \r\n    the address format between base58 format and base32 format, see `convcashaddr`  rpc command \r\n    usage\r\n  - Remove witness relative address encoding: `AddressWitnessPubKeyHash` and `AddressWitnessScriptHash`\r\n- Add the following op_code due to May 2018 hard fork:\r\n  - OP_CAT\r\n  - OP_SPLIT\r\n  - OP_AND\r\n  - OP_OR\r\n  - OP_XOR\r\n  - OP_DIV\r\n  - OP_MOD\r\n  - OP_NUM2BIN\r\n  - OP_BIN2NUM\r\n  > Detail: [https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/may-2018-reenabled-opcodes.md](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/may-2018-reenabled-opcodes.md)\r\n- Misc changes:\r\n  - Remove `Witness` item from `TxIn`\r\n  - Adjust the block size limit to `32M`\r\n  - Remove the deprecated logic code, including: `txweigth` and  `blockweight`\r\n  - Adjust the `GetSigOpCost` calculation\r\n  - Adjust the `OP_RETURN` bytes length to 220\r\n  - Rename the amount unit from `BTC` to `BCH`",
