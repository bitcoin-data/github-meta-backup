Privacy is about things that a user does not want to share with others.

The attack scenario I have in mind is the worst-case scenario of a full RCE. \r\n\r\nIn the case of an RCE vulnerability I think that the likelihood of successful _reliable_ exploitation is _much_ higher given exact knowledge of `CLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR`, `CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR` _and_ `CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD` compared to knowing _only_ say `CLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR`.
