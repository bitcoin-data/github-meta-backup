      "body": "I think there's a legitimate UI issue here. Even if the `prune=0` setting from `bitcoin.conf` take precedences over the GUI pruning setting, the pruning checkbox is still checked by default and that is misleading. I think Ideally when the \"Use a custom data directory\" option is changed, the `bitcoin.conf` file from that path would be reloaded and the settings shown will actually reflect the settings that will be applied. #15936 addresses this issue somewhat, because it at least ensures that the setting displayed will be the setting applied. But it doesn't take the additional step of loading the `bitcoin.conf` and displaying the disabled value.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25052#issue-1222628734\r\n\r\n> I don't want to prune and have therefore set prune=0 in bitcoin.conf. But that won't stop 23.0 from pruning. Have to manually un-tick the tick box at startup.\r\n\r\nJust to reinforce what hebasto wrote, setting prune=0 in bitcoin.conf _will_ stop 23.0 from pruning, and you do not have to un-tick the box. The box is just overridden and ignored so ticking or unticking it has no effect.\r\n",

Not even sure pruning has been carried out even though the screen said it was doing it.\r\n\r\nHave the block chain been pruning? If not, why did it say it was doing it? Why can I not stop the pruning with q or clicking on the x in upper right corner and must shut down Tails OS to stop the pruning? Why is it necessary to un-tick the Limit block chain... when prune=0 is set in bitcoin.conf?\r\n\r\nFinally what command should I use to make sure the full block chain is downloaded and that no blocks are missing due to pruning?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis might interest you as well.

      "body": "I see two issues here:\r\n1. the Prune checkbox is checked, even if you have disabled it via the command line args. This is legit, I can reproduce and will submit a PR to fix. I think this should be addressed in bitcoin-core/gui\r\n2. based on your tests, the claim is \"prune happens if I pass the prune=0 in my configs but keep the checkbox ticked on the Intro GUI page\". I was not able to reproduce this yet. The point is when I have the config file there, the Intro does not show up anymore. Or I'm missing something here?",

      "body": "I thnik that this is related to the fact that pruning is REQUIRED now if you have only 450MiB or storage. Today, you need about 512 \"GiB\" of dedicated store for the main storage (blocks/blk*.dat, blocks/rev*.dat, blocks/index/*.ldb) and for chainstate/*.ldb (indexes stored when shutting down, e.g. before a reboot needed for system updates and maintenance).\r\n\r\nAnd anyway we lack an option to segregate those files by type, and an offline tool to check/resync them correctly. The current BitCoin Qt client shuold also flush to disk much more often than waiting for many hours (or days) to flush its structures computed in the memory pool (which should be working as a writeback cache and should never need to be so large, except on very few servers with very high capacities and very fast and large storage, hundreds of GiB of RAM, many more cores and ultra high internet bandwidths: even a server on a shared hosting platform will not comply if you don't pay a lot for it to Amazon, or Azure: Bitcoin core is also crashing there on basic offers or on any free trial offers, due to low count or cores, low memory, low amount of storage, even if it's very fast, and capped bandwidths ven if it can reach gigabit for a reduced time before being billed or capped!)\r\n\r\nAs long as this will not be resolved, Bitcoin Core will not really be \"peer-to-peer\" and the Bitcoin will remain easily attackable by some malicious large third parties (not using too much costly means, even if most users cannot pay for it): there's NOT enough peers in the network to protect it, too many limited peers, not enough full peers. As well, the network \"degree\" is also too low (we should increase it to sustain more than 10 \"block peers\" and more than just 2 \"full peers\". May be add an extra layer of \"medium peers\" that can dedicate about 100Gb of store with FTTH or fast VDSL at home: instead of verifying at most the 6 most recent blocks, it would be increased to verify about ten times more, without depending to very few critical \"full peers\"!",

Its not a GUI issue its something deeper.\n\nHave updated my original post with additional screenshots and information. If not un-ticking the Limit chain block storage, it will prune.\n\nThank you very much\n\n------- Original Message -------\nOn Monday, May 2nd, 2022 at 8:42 PM, Ryan Ofsky ***@***.***> wrote:\n\n> I think there's a legitimate UI issue here. Even if the prune=0 setting from bitcoin.conf take precedences over the GUI pruning setting, the pruning checkbox is still checked by default and that is misleading. I think Ideally when the \"Use a custom data directory\" option is changed, the bitcoin.conf file from that path would be reloaded and the settings shown will actually reflect the settings that will be applied. [#15936](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15936) addresses this issue somewhat, because it at least ensures that the setting displayed will be the setting applied. But it doesn't take the additional step of loading the bitcoin.conf and displaying the disabled value.\n>\n> re: [#25052 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25052#issue-1222628734)\n>\n>> I don't want to prune and have therefore set prune=0 in bitcoin.conf.

The box is just overridden and ignored so ticking or unticking it has no effect.\n>\n> —\n> Reply to this email directly, [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25052#issuecomment-1115346657), or [unsubscribe](https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AT3SEC73DD2R2N5HCJL3US3VIA42DANCNFSM5U3KZFLQ).\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.Message ID: ***@***.***>",
