    "body": "When using Bitcoin version v0.13.99.0-86f9e3d compiled myself with libdb 5.3 on Debian Jessie, AMD64, the balances reported by listaccounts become inconsistent:\r\n\r\n$ bitcoin-cli listaccounts | grep -v \\ 0.00000000\r\n{\r\n  \"\": -27.58320234,\r\n  \"PP\": 4.00584319,\r\n}\r\n$ bitcoin-cli getbalance\r\n9.43349050\r\n\r\nWhen reverting back to an older version (Bitcoin version v0.11.99.0-32520bf-dirty), the balance becomes correct again:\r\n\r\n$ bitcoin-cli listaccounts | grep -v \\ 0.00000000\r\n{\r\n  \"\": 5.32762789,\r\n  \"PP\": 4.10586261,\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe sum equals my total balance.\r\n\r\nThis happens on AMD64.  I tried compiling the the same version on an armv7l CPU, using approximately the same wallet (from an older backup), and the balances there are reported correctly.  Either the inconsistency has shown up later, or due to using this wallet backup on the ARM for some transaction during downtime on the AMD64.\r\n\r\nI get most of my incoming BTC to other accounts, and move them to \"\" when paid for.\r\n\r\nI have rolled git back and forward in a tedious search for the exact commit causing this bug.  I found that the bug is not present at 1b5118bfa0d94dbc0f3d7803c3e68626b0a694ee, but shows up at the next commit: 30c2d8c635c41149b7184ea8471121c53042444c.  This is a merge of pull request #7105.\r\n\r\nSomething in pull request #7105 is causing the sum of account balances to become wrong, possibly only when it discovers outgoing wallet transactions created on a different node.",

Still much lower than my real balance.\n\nThere is more weirdness, which I discovered now.  `bitcoin-cli listunspent 0` with the newer version lists a lot of my spent outputs, some of them multiple times, with 0 confirmations and wrong (nonexisting) txid.  I can identify the spent outputs via the address and amount.  The scriptPubKey may be correct as well.  It lists all my real unspent outputs as well, with correct txid and number of confirmations.  The sum of the unspent values from real transactions equals what getbalance reports without the argument, i.e. the real balance.  The older version will only list the real unspent outputs, not any of the bogus ones.\n",

A rescan should correct the wallet inconsistencies (`bitcoind -rescan`; it will take a while). To prevent this kind of problem in the future, you should avoid sharing your wallet between bitcoin-core instances; you can transfer funds from one node to another with ordinary transactions. I also recommend finding an alternative to the built-in accounting system; it has been deprecated for some time and will be removed.\n",

Hopefully someone who does so will open-source the product.

      "body": "@kazcw I don't think people are asking for core to track people's \"balances\". I just want to know when there is a deposit to people's deposit addresses with a certain number of confirmations, and if that deposit is later reorged out of the chain, I want to know about it.\n\nThat's what the accounting system does for me currently, and I don't know how I would do it if accounting was to be removed.\n\nI use 'listaccounts' to tell me when there's a new deposit. Any 'account' that shows up as non-zero has a new deposit. I then 'move' that amount to the default account and process the deposit in my application (which tracks the balance).\n\nSo rather than thinking that people are looking for an accounting system, what if we were just wanting to know when a deposit arrived, and when it disappeared again due to a reorg? That's all I need. Will it be possible if the accounting code is deleted?\n",
