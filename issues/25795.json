    "body": "Been thinking about this and pushed some refactoring that you might like a bit more.\r\n\r\nThe idea was based on try to not mix the Coin Selection code with the inputs fetching while still be able to remove the manual coins selection stuff from the automatic coin selection, the extra loops for the pre-set inputs and  the `FetchCoins` wrapper function.\r\n\r\nSo, have decoupled the `SelectCoins` into two functions:\r\n\r\n1) AutomaticCoinSelection:\r\nWhich is basically the previously called `SelectCoins` without the manually selected inputs stuff.\r\nSo, it will purely receive a set of coins and be in charge of selecting the best subset of them to\r\ncover the target amount.\r\n\r\n2) SelectCoins:\r\nIn charge of selecting all the user manually selected coins first (\"pre-set inputs\"), and\r\nif coin_control 'm_allow_other_inputs=true', call 'AutomaticCoinSelection' to select a\r\nset of coins such that the target - pre_set_inputs.total_amount is met. Then merge\r\nboth results.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @furszy in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25685#discussion_r939527188 _",
