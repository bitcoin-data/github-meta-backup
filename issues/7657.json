    "body": "After switching to bitcoin 0.12, I'm seeing a rather concerning amount of unspent transactions:\n\n```\n$ bitcoin-cli listunspent | grep amount | wc -l\n734\n```\n\nWhich make it very painful (and expensive!) to sweep the wallet. Previously it used to hover around 10-20 unspent or so.\n\nFull dump of  [bitcoin-cli listunspent | grep amount](https://gist.github.com/RHavar/77cab9accc5c644fb64a) on bitcoin 0.12\n\nIf it helps, during the time period I have received about 2.6x as many transactions as I have sent. The average receive amount was 0.11 BTC, and average send 0.26 BTC.\n\nFrom the looks of it, it's as if it's trying to perpetually create change of 0.01 BTC, and never really inclined to spend from it. \n",

If before it was using lots of extraneous inputs, it would've kept the unspent set in check.\n\nRight now, since last night the set has continued to grow:\n\n> $ bitcoin-cli listunspent | grep amount | wc -l\n> 786\n\nWhich gives me the impression that it is almost trying to converge on `100*$amountOfBitcoins` outputs, which is clearly extremely unideal.\n\nDoing a quick skim of the code, it seems the situation could be improved a lot by making bitcoin aggressively attempt to make transactions without a change output, remembering that there are potentially three extra costs associated with creating a change output:\na) The cost associated with the extra transaction size\nb) The cost associated with how in the future, that output will need to be spent\nc) Privacy (normally change addresses are super easy to determine, which then get spent-linked with the rest of your wallet)\n\nAnd lets say you figure the extra associated cost of a change output to be ~80.00 bits, a side benefit of forgoing that change output to save 79.00 bits, would be that extra money is going to mining fees, and might help confirm faster. \n\nI'm also not convinced that trying to make change outputs at least 0.01 BTC is particularly useful once you factor into the cost of creating change outputs For instance some extra dust outputs is actually essential in helping sourcing the exact amount of inputs required.\n",

My thoughts were that the code should run coin selection twice. Once for a transaction with no change output (trying to minimize for the extraneous mining fee), and once for a transaction with a change output. \n\nThen you can compare the mining fee of the two transactions (but applying a X penalty to the one with a change output)  and pick the one with a smaller mining fee. \n\n(I think X will be around ~50 bits, but you can more scientifically calculate it by figuring out the extra fee increase transaction by increase a transaction size of +1 output and +1 transaction input)\n",

But if it was $0.02 (50 bits) more in fees to avoid an extra output, it would likely be worth it.\n\nAlready the strategy of bitcoin core is to try to construct a changeless output, if at all possible. The only way to directly reduce the amount of change created from the current state is to burn change as fees more often. Less directly, the wallet could try to create change amounts which are more likely to be useful without change in the future; though the potential for that is fairly modest in most cases.\n\nIf indeed #4906's change is the cause of what you're seeing and not something else, then it's likely that issue isn't that it's creating more change, the issue is that it's avoiding sweeping up outputs that it otherwise would sweep up.\n",

This turns out to be pretty rare. \n\n@MarcoFalke I think you might underestimate the effect:  Consider, adding just one extra input to a transaction counteracts the UTXO-count impact of the transaction creating change. It also means that the average value of utxo in your wallet would strictly increase. If extra inputs aren't added, we would expect the average value of UTXO in your wallet to decrease over time.  Low value UTXO are not as likely to be selected in the future, because the selection algorithm generally tries to minimize the number of inputs used.\n",

      "body": "I downgraded to 0.11 and it cleaned it up pretty fast, so it probably is a 0.12 regression (at least for my specific use-case). I'm guessing if I sent more often than I received the problem wouldn't really exist.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure how bad the problem is. If it's just #7664  it would means that I'm paying the fees later instead of right away, which isn't so terrible. The real problem is that it's generating so many outputs of 0.01 BTC, which is totally useless. Having a lot of dust outputs would in fact be more useful (e.g. for when i need to send dust, a common case :P) \n\nAlso, is it just my imagination or does 0.11 have better estimatefee logic too? I've never once on bitcoin 0.12  see  `bitcoin-cli estimatefee 1` return anything but -1, and it seems to give significantly more expensive estimates than before. \n",
