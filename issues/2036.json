    "body": "@gavinandresen 's mining refactor eliminated the check for GetMinFee on transactions included in blocks. Whether that was intentional or not, I think it's important to reinstate some of the DoS rules - particularly the one for very small outputs. Perhaps the way to do this is to add the check for GetMinFee back in, and skip anything we don't want checked in GetMinFee with GMF_BLOCK mode?\n",

The drop to 0.0005 BTC fees was the result of 1 BTC = $25, so if anything the logical step would be to increase the minimums to 0.001 BTC, not decrease it to 0.0001 BTC.\n\nRethinking how we apply this or other anti-DoS rules is fine, but right now we seem to have reduced the limits so that spam can get into the free areas more easily than it had been intended(? - or at least discussed). Considering blk0002 is nearly full in a very short amount of time, we should probably do _something_.\n",
