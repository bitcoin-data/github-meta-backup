    "body": "Having hundreds of badly developed and programmed Bitcoin applications does not help the cause of Bitcoin. So Bitcoin-QT should conservatively implement all important functions of Bitcoin usage.\n\nI assume we all agree digital storage is not build for eternity. Bitcoin-QT should definitely support cold storage. I suggest to create Bitcoin addresses NOT storing the private keys in the wallet file or any other digital storage but printing them on paper using QR-codes and OCR-A font. Bitcoin-QT should also have functions to scan paperwallets, read their QR-codes, fall back to optical character recognition and verify the scanned private keys match the Bitcoin addresses.\n\nThis will prevent average-joes loosing their savings which would have a big negative impact on the reputaion of the Bitcoin system.\n",

Bitcoin-qt, in contrast with Armory, is very much unsuited for offline usage.\n\nWe'll also need deterministic wallet support, otherwise the printed backup will be out of date as soon as it's printed.\n\nAlso: many printers these days are networked (allowing interception on the wire), or store printed pages (if only for a while). \n",
