    "body": "I have tried several times ln changing the conf file to suit my solo mining needs but every time I try to enter the rpc calls into the configuration file I keep getting error after error.\r\nI  don't know if adding the rpc user and password is the problem because I didn't get the problem until I shut the program down and started it up again ,what shocked me was it didn't resync and yet I am getting these problems. My question is could it be that adding the configuration file in to appdata\\bitcoin folder be the fault or problem ,please help as I am tiring to get this to work and I am to old to lose any more hair.\r\nPlease help and thank you and for your time. \r\n",
