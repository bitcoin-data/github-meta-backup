      "body": "My point is that without a POW hash migration path, there does not appear to be a way to easily and rapidly switch in the event a weakness or vulnerability becoming evident. Like I said, I personally think he's full of crap, but that doesn't mean that bitcoind currently hasn't all its eggs in one basket for the POW blockchain. I'm not advocating we switch immediately, I'm requesting we get the infrastructure in-place to do the switch, or at least publish the plan for it.\n\nIf you're saying it's fine in your mind to have miners who are operating at four orders of base-10 magnitude apart from one another, then perhaps this is a non-issue. Is this the stance from the devs?\n\nThe thought and designwork behind \"switching within a day\" is precisely what I'm talking about. What is that path? How would it be done? I'm not a dev, I don't know what you guys have been talking about in whatever channels you guys talk about it in. Document it, at least, please, even if there's no code to it. What is the plan, specifically, for switching if it becomes necessary? And, if that plan doesn't actually exist and you're just saying it _would_ be easy, then please reopen this request and consider it a reasonable venue for tracking that work which will eventually be done.\n\nThe other part of the point is that this manner of response isn't as informative as I am requesting it to be for miners like myself who are spending considerable capital on mining equipment. Is there a purpose for this apparently opaque designwork?\n\nI'm not saying you should jump and issue panicky statements at the first sign of idiotic rumour-mongering. I'm just asking for a measured, honest, and transparent response to molehills like this, even if it takes a while, so we can participate in, poke holes in, and otherwise help with, the solution to problems which will materialize in the future.\n\nFinally, the last part is that some of us who are spending considerable capital on mining equipment want to hear from the horse's mouth, specifically: do you know anything about this, at all? If you have, I am asking you to please document that. Do you know of this, have you heard anything substantive, and what will you do when it does (as it inevitably will) become substantive?\n",
