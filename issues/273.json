Probably due to sending the block chain to fellow bitcoin users ( I had about 65 connections at the time )..\n\nThe ability to limit / throttle the network usage like most other p2p programs would be beneficial.  Otherwise I have to ensure I close the Bitcoin application to keep it from killing my upload.\n",

Some extra information:\n\nI usually have ~32 connections in bitcoin.  Receive seems to be fine.  After 10 mins the current bitcoin.exe connections have downloaded about 100kB each, but, download is usually not as limited as upload.\n\nAfter about 10 mins the current bitcoin.exe connections use about 100kB upload each, but, there are ~3 which uses ~1MB+.  This comes to over 10kB/s average (not much average wise).  But I suspect when those 1MB+ guys are going it uses 100% of the upload and just drops down to 7.5kB/s average after that part is done.\n\nPreferably I'd like to limit upload to 2kB/s to 5kB/s on my current connection.\n\nEDIT: I'm using bitcoin 0.3.24-beta\n",

I am on DSL with no other options, and it is a solid 50-70 kilobyte (not kilobit) upload, making the connection completely unusable for anything else.  Someday, Google Fiber will bring me a giant fat pipe and this won't be a concern, but since I live in a fairly rural area, it is not likely for a while.\n\nThis lack of upload control harms the network because I turn the whole node completely off unless I am actually engaging in a transaction.  Wouldn't it be better to have a slow node than no node?\n",

Forcing the user to do something that will harm its own internet is an outrageous decision. \n\nNot to mention that, once the user finds out what is hammering its internet, the most common decision is kill the program who is causing the problem and abandon it, or use it as low as possible, it becomes a bad thing instead of a good thing. This is bad marketing. This disappoints me in so many ways.\n\nHow am i going to recommend this to a friend knowing that later the same friend will come to me and say \"hey remember that program you told me to use? it was messing with my internet, making it very slow, i couldn't even see a utube video in piece, bad call dud\". That's the least that could happen, and this is just a simple example.\n\nLike cjastram just pointed out, better to HAVE a slow node than NO node at all. If the devs were intelligent enough to create such an futuristic and advanced code, i'm sure they already know everything we are pointing out here, no more words, i'm done.\n",

You don't magically get a fast sync just because you don't allow nodes the ability to throttle.  The problem is that if you don't allow throttling, then you get _no_ node because people just turn it off.\n\nAfter a while of people just turning it off, then you start getting massive sync load on the system because people need to sync hundreds (or thousands) of blocks whenever they want to do a BTC transaction.  Instead of the lightweight sync load that happens in realtime, you have a small (but significant) number of people that require loads of bandwidth all at once.\n\nHence the problem.  If we could just leave BitCoin turned on at low bandwidth, then we wouldn't have the sync issue.\n\n> Instead, I think we need a \"non server\" mode (some checkbox, perhaps asked on first startup), which disables serving (historic) blocks, disables listening (by default) and disables NODE_NETWORK (so nodes don't announce themself as full noes).

      "body": "@cjastram That is actually my point: I think it's better for people who do cannot or don't want to serve historic blocks to not do that at all, and not even advertize on the network that they do. If we enable bandwidth throttling without that, the chance of accidentally hitting a slow node would increase, while if we remove those nodes from the pool altogether, the chance for that decreases.\n\nPeople fully shutting down nodes because it saturates their data link is of course bad. Throttling or disabling serving would improve that, but you're close to the resources you're willing to spend, perhaps you shouldn't run a full node in the first place.\n\nJust relay of new transactions and blocks is typically quite low bandwidth - it's just when you get hit by a node that is syncing from scratch that you suddenly get an upload burst. \n\nAbout over-engineering: the ability to run a pruned node is an inevitable evolution somewhere in the future, in my opinion, and it would also imply a solution to your problem anyway.\n",

      "body": "OP here, its been a while since creating this issue and for the past 2 years my bitcoin-qt client has very rarely maxed out my upload so I didn't think too much about it.\n\nBut recently, in the last month or two I have noticed that my upload or sending data out is quite often completely maxed!  I have a decent connection, something like 300-500KB/s upload.  Luckily i've managed to catch it most times and I open up a network monitoring tool and kill the ports in question (always bitcoin-qt).  I have to be careful because if it ran at that speed for a long period of time, not only would my net be slow but it will quickly consume my data quota.\n\nSo now instead of running a full node for ~8 hours a day I let it sync with the network and then shut it down.\n\nIf I had a throttle option, I would set it at something like 50KB/s upload.. this is faster than I ever use when downloading the latest blocks (CPU bound).\n\nI think this is a problem, I would like to run a full node, but will not while it consumes 100% of my upload majority of the time.\n",

      "body": "For anyone wanting to reduce the impact of their bitcoin-qt client, I've created a quick-fix, which minimizes the traffic while I'm using a wifi network that charges per megabyte. This patch adds a command line option, so that the client downloads only blocks and not transactions, and doesn't upload anything other than the transactions that you create. The downside is that this isn't healthy for the network as a whole, won't display transactions that you're monitoring from elsewhere until they're included in a block, and reduces anonymity in that you'll only broadcast your own transactions and not anyone else's. Also, the alert feature is disabled also, so you won't see alerts for urgent upgrades (not that this was reliable anyway in the case of the recent 0.8 hardfork!).\n\nIdeally this would be toggleable from within the GUI or even able to automatically switch on and off depending on which ISP you want it to activate with, IMHO.\n\nOh, here is the abovementioned branch: https://github.com/rebroad/bitcoin/commits/MinimizeTraffic\n\nI still maintain that there ought to be a way that nodes like this (that don't relay txs and blocks) ought to advertise themselves as such upon connection so that other nodes can make an informed decision on deciding whether to connect to other nodes or not that are relaying. Without this advertising, nodes can only guess based upon frequency of txs and blocks received from such nodes.\n",

      "body": "I think a system of upload throttle is useful, with nodes advertising their available bandwidth, and other nodes validating this, and this information included in the address information which is relayed. This way, nodes can prefer nodes with greater bandwidth, and the node can calculate the bandwidth available based upon how many nodes are currently uploading or downloading. The bandwidth per connection can continue to be monitored, and connections changed as and when needed. This is already something I've been coding in my parallelblocksdownload branch, and allows it to choose how many nodes to download from based upon the bandwidth it knows is available. If it finds the upload bandwidth is saturated, it'll simply stop sending invs (to new nodes) so that those nodes don't request data from it.\n",

      "body": "Just by saying:  \"And I'm quite sure the idea is to not have all the \"fast\" servers in a few countries (...)\"\nYou make my point.\n\nBy limiting /your/ bandwidth you offload the work to others, who will also limit theirs, &c.\nUntil you end up in the scenario of which you're quite sure, is not the idea.\nKudos to you.\n\nIf you throttle the blockchain, you don't trust bitcoin. (you think of it as stealing, think about it)\n\nAll this is nice and such, but the client is still interfering with your download speed.\n\nIn answer to the original poster's : \n\"I noticed the other day Bitcoin was maxing out my upload bandwidth on ADSL. Probably due to sending the block chain to fellow bitcoin users ( I had about 65 connections at the time )..\"\n\nThe real answer has already been given by \"luke-jr\" who posted:\n\"QoS is really a router job, but I guess reliable routers aren't too common :/\"\n\nCynics never seem to want to give a straigh answer :/\n\nHe meant to say, probably, that one should better complain about routers not adhering to or even implementing traffic shaping standards. Just checking a box and clicking apply doesn't necessarily mean it happens, not even on /open/ hard- or software. Bugs anyone? \nAlthough in the latter case they have a higher chance of being found and fixed.\n\n(somewhat poetic methinks: bitcoins changing the world by people complaining to the networkmakers their bitcoins aren't going through fast enough)\n\nThis works on the premise that bitcoin-qt client adheres to QoS standards.\nWhich was the original posters' client. (I mistook him for a troll at first)\n\nWhich it seems to do for a long time.\nEven though traffic has recently increased, my router at least, graciously, lets me see my \"ted talk\" full speed. Throttling bitcoin traffic? Yes! But according to the QoS bit, ie. my bandwidth is mine.\n\nIn stead of pointing out to the developers that for some reason or other his bitcointraffic had increased (an act in vein I suppose, they already know, or he failed to check) and supplying them with at the very least operating system details and client version used...  Nooooo ....\n\nThe immediate functionality proffered: throttling, choking. How human.\n\nThis \"solution\" has already been applied to bittorrent clients.\nutorrent (to name one) implemented it's own traffic shaper.\nInstead of complaining to the router makers.\n\nIf there are no, or only few seeders for this \"ted talk\" you just wished to see right now (or within certain limits therof), no \"ted talk\" for you right now (or within certain limits therof). Or maybe never, the seed is dead.\n\nNow be honest, what's /your/ overall share ratio, did you cap the upload? Do you still seed the \"ted talk\"?\nDo you cycle ports? Accept only encrypted connections, so your provider can't sniff bittorent protocol, to keep bandwidth up? Have used TOR? (although, that's ridiculous: torrents over tor)\n\nThat's the consequence.\nBittorrent, how beautiful it is, is crippled just because of that. Not because it's censored.\n(I'm in Holland and cannot access piratebay.com, but DHT seems to work very well though, but I do get a lot of fake \"ted talks\".)\n\nEvery bitcoin is retraceable, up to the first 50 (just look up block 0) and every other bitcoin after that. (if you've got the time; computers have)\nThere're no copy- or other rights on the protocol or the numbers that are sent.\nFurthermore BTC traffic may not, cannot be capped or blocked. It's legal, or, not illegal.\n\nI cannot but admire the stanza of the btc-core devs by going all Douglas Adams-y: \"It is somebody else's problem\".\n\nOk, and now for the real issue:\nNobody has /obliged/ you to keep the client running!\nHogs your bandwidth? Stop it! But expect a delay to check recent transactions though, so you know where your coins are coming from, and can thus trust them.\n\nYou don't walk alround with your wallet open all day do you? Registering where all your money comes from?\n\nOh, and ask yourself this question \"bitcoins to money or vice versa?\"\nEither way, stop complaining, learn how to program, implement this feature in your fork of bitcoin-qt.\nSit back, and see it implemented ... or not.\n\nThen and only then do you have the right to complain, be ready for a battle though. You'll have to be really convincing and able to explain /why/ throttling is any good.\n\nAs \"nadrimajstor\" opted: \" (...) add -nolisten argument\"\n\nIf you don't listen, there's no dialog. Therefore your transactions are void..\n\n:/\n\nEinstein could have said:\n- \"If you can explain the problem to your grandmother you understand the problem,\"\n\nIf you think you learned something:\n1LwRoFi19fUWw4jtxEuQVXFNr29kd4mjmB\n\nIf you think I should shut up:\n15B4oqE6e2skviM67kSmAB3yp77GChjPnL\n\nThank you!\n",

I have a monthly bw quota on the machine where I'm running bitcoind.\n\nFrom my understanding, the more nodes, the more reliable this network is (or the less likely is that some individual or institution can take-over bitcoin network by controlling the majority of nodes), I can add QoS to limit bitcoind (and I will, you bet I will), however, the average user just don't know how to do that.  Adding a simple setting that limits bitcoind bw usage will just encourage people to run the client.... for now, the daemon goes down until I get the time to configure QoS, however, if it had a simpler way to throttle it _now_, it would continue to run, 24/7.\n\nI'm not very interested in coins at all (I first heard about this project several years ago), I just found the idea to be interesting, and assumed that adding more \"honest\" nodes to the network would be good.... apparently you don't really care about that, you just want \"a few fast nodes\" instead of _many_ not-so-fast nodes.  I think that \"the more the best\" for this kind of system... but maybe I'm wrong.\n",

      "body": "@soulhunter There seems to be a bit of confusion here.\n\nOf course we need many nodes if we want a decentralized system. But we mainly want many nodes that validate - Bitcoin's primary advantage over other currencies (in my opinion) is that I don't need to trust anyone to know nobody is cheating. If it's easier to run such a node, the less people will have not to do so.\n\nHowever, to bootstrap a new node, it needs to be shown the history of the current state, so it can independently also assess that nothing in the past was fraudulent. Thus, we need a way of feeding them this history, and it's provided by other nodes in the network that also at some had to download that history anyway. Ideally, we also have as many of these as possible. But reality is not perfect. Not everyone wants to sacrifice their upstream for doing this, while others have plenty of upstream to spare. And, with the current buggy implementation, if you're accidentally hitting a slow peer to download from, you'll have a slow download. We don't have a mechanism to search for good peers or parallellize the download. Thus, as long as the sync mechanism is not improved, yes everyone is better off with few faster uploaders than many slower ones. Note that this is just about serving historic blocks to others - you can perfectly validate all blocks and transactions, and participate otherwise in the network without providing that service.\n",

For at least 20 years, so maybe by then, everyone on Earth will have a router with a decent QoS code built-in and also fiber internet to deal with all throughput-data.\n\nBut right now, the way it is, it's like suicidal mission IMHO, this gets me so sad and mad and disappointed simultaneously that i can not even explain in words how i feel about this.

Thus the advice to disable listening if you're bandwidth constrained so that you won't do this. Without feeding new nodes the maximum average utilization is on the order of 100kbit/sec or so.\n",

(this is part of the reason why I'm \nrunning a client on a server, to keep it up 24/7 and help the network).  \nAlso, disabling \"incoming\" doesn't magically fix that, because you can \nstill get into an incomplete node via an outgoing connection (although \nthe probability gets greatly reduced).  Anyway, this far, the amount of \nBW it has eaten is not _that_ huge (just \"spiky\").  I'll keep it running \nfor a few more weeks and lets see (it looks like it will be using \n~500GB/mo, I can afford that, for now).\n\nWhy not implement something simple?\n1. Add basic upload BW limit option (there are several ways of doing \n   this, I'll not elaborate now).\n2. When a client is downloading, and has more than 1 peer, it should \n   download from a given peer for N seconds (say: N=300), and then move to \n   the next one in a round-robin (or even random) schema.  This way a given \n   client will not be \"stuck\" on a single slow peer, but will likely move \n   from fast to slow peers while it downloads, and spread the download load.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIldefonso.\n",

      "body": "If one imagines the blockchain as a 7GB+ torrent file, is there anything stopping us from using bittorrent architecture ideas to bootstrap clients? @jgarzik already implemented this idea independent of the client [over here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=145386.0). I'm guessing that bloating the client by linking to libtransmission or its ilk is not acceptable (or would it be?). It might not be secure either. It probably does solve several problems associated with bandwidth and data cap management. \n\nPerhaps as an independent experiment someone (I?) should try implementing a patch to respond only to historical data requests beyond a certain date or block number. I'm guessing most peers are either totally out of date (requiring the entire history) or else only a week or two out of date. I'm absolutely making this up, so I could be grossly wrong, but it seems like a reasonable guess. Assuming this is true, most peers could be served by setting a date filter a couple weeks in the past, and require brand new peers to resort to Jeff Garzik's torrent or whatever other mechanism might be available. It's not helpful to new clients, but it might easy bandwidth use.\n",

If anyone knows what port bitcoin uses, I'll happily throttle it.  I use Tomato as my WiFi router and I'm sure it's full featured enough to provide the functionality to do this - just so long as the port isn't port 80, of course, because I'm not going to throttle standard web traffic just for the sake of bitcoin, but I'd be surprised if that's the case.\n\nNever mind, just googled it and found the answer to my own question in the bitcoin FAQ.  For anyone else who is interested, the port Bitcoin uses is port 8333.  If there's anyone else here using Tomato, I'll happily post instructions for throttling this port once I figure out how to do it.  Let me know if there's any interest.\n",

      "body": "Funny and sad that you guys don't get that running a node with a upload bandwidth limit is better than not running a node. Not running a Bitcoin node seems to be the alternative the developers prefer and I'm fine with not doing that.\n\nConsider this: You have a fiber and ADSL and you run tor, i2p, a bittorrent client and perhaps some other stuff. All these things - basically all SANE P2P software - let you set an upload bandwidth limit so you can browse the web and do other things with your connection normally. Then you have bitcoind which basically tries to use 100% of your connection and makes everything else crawl to a halt. Most people will simply see bitcoind as something that lacks the most basic features all other P2P software has (ability to set port port, limit number of connections, bandwidth etc) and not run it.\n\nI see this bug is 3 years old. I'll check back in 3 years to see if the devs arguing against bandwidth limiting have figured out that having a lot of nodes with a bandwidth limit is better than having only a few high-bandwidth nodes with dedicated connections by then. I'm guessing they won't but one can hope.\n",

FWIW, (and I don't know if you actually care about the technology or are just here to gripe) no one was at all opposed to having a limit. There were changes needed as prerequisites to having a limit and they are now almost done (headers first has had some preparatory changes in 0.9 and should be finished in the next version).  If you're having problems with the usage immediately you can set listen=0 in bitcoin.conf and shunt 95% of the bursty outbound traffic immediately with no adverse impact on the network, this is the recommendation for a short term workaround— not failing to run a node. \n",

On an 8/1mbps (down/up) connection bitcoin-qt would DoS itself by uploading so much stuff that the system had no internet anymore. None at all. Pings would not be delayed; they just timed out. Services like LogMeIn reported there was no longer internet connectivity and browsing became basically impossible.\n\nRight now, a year later after my previous comments here, I have a fiber connection and even with listen=1 it all works well, but it wasn't nice to need to run bitcoin-qt (to catch up with the chain) exclusively while the rest of my family was asleep.\n",

      "body": "@gmaxwell Yes, I should have pointed it out earlier. I thought I remembered commenting that bitcoin-qt killed its own connection, but it seems I misremember. Sorry about that. What I said still holds up though: even distributing blocks as they go across the network is a lot of data.\n\nLooking at blockchain.info right now, 20 minutes ago there was a block of 0.9MB. Times 7 (one peer must already have it) makes a 6MB upload. On my previous connection that'd cause just over 1 minute of no internet.\n\nGoing over these numbers it's pretty clear that running a full bitcoin node on such a connection is just not going to help anyone. But I don't need to be a full node, I just want to run the official (or perhaps I should say \"generally leading\") bitcoin client with my own block chain. Having a switch for not uploading blocks and/or not uploading transactions would be helpful. This is said to cause DoS issues, but I'd say that's a problem in this client and not a network issue: anyone can setup and advertise a lot of rogue nodes that never do anything. Non-listening nodes should disconnect peers that seem to be only leeching because they might be trying to slow down or disturb the network.\n",

I never did find a good solution.\n\nSince the devs have yet to give us the ability to rate limit in the daemon I decided to use iptables to enforce a limit. In case it helps anyone else, the rules below are what I used. It's very painful to update after being offline for a while, but it works well once you are synced.\n\n// Rate limit outbound bitcoind (we have to get both source and destination ports 8333)\n-A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 8333 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -m limit --limit 30/sec --limit-burst 150 -j ACCEPT\n-A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 8333 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j DROP\n-A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 8333 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -m limit --limit 30/sec --limit-burst 150 -j ACCEPT\n-A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 8333 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j DROP\n",

Perhaps based on the desired bandwidth limits of the light-servers, the distance backwards in blocktime that will be uploaded to syncing peers could be set\n\nFor example: \nUser A with 'light-server' selected who wants to dedicate a minimal amount of their upstream bandwidth will go backwards only to the block that has a blocktime is 7 days before their latest block.\n\nUser B with 'light-server' also enabled, but willing to donate a little more bandwitdth (but not sync the entire blockchain) can sync blocks all the way to a blocktime of 30 days prior to current block time.\n\nThat way there is no actual connection limit speed causing a node to be stuck syncing from a slow node.    \n\nUpdate: This would require the ability for nodes to switch to another sync node without failing\n",

So until that is fixed, yes, I believe not running a (reachable) node is better than running a throttled one.  \n\n -\n\n> You're causing that same painful performance to any other user that happens to sync from you, so please be sure to set listen=0 when running that way.  \n\nIsn't a node running on a slow connection like a \"throttled\" one  ?\nLet's say we have 2 nodes: A running on a 1 Mbps connection and B on a 1 Gbps one. Even with a bandwidth limit on B (like 100 Mbps), it's better to sync from B than A!\nAlso wouldn't it be better for a node to limit its upload to 90% of it in order to avoid saturation ? (ack packets etc.). Maybe node A would run better with a 900 Kbps throtle (and other user would be abble to surf the web) ?\n\nLast, having this kind of seeting would be a way to \"announce\" your node speed to other and let them decide to sync (or not) from you.\n",

      "body": "Throttling on a very basic level of network commands would probably a bad idea and can already be done with soft- and hardware (router / iptables, etc.).\nThrottling would also uncomfortable for the node on the other end.\n\nWhat most full node operators should make happy would be a way of not serving historical blocks when certain preconditions are reached. I'm pretty sure the complains where users got very high outbound traffic was because their nodes where serving lots of historical blocks to nodes in initial sync.\n\nI'd like to implement a feature which would enable to set a total-cap-per-day, and if reached, it would no longer serve nodes requesting blocks < self.height-100(TBD). The connected node might then switch to a different node. Throttling `block` responses would be a bad idea IMO.\n\nI'm also searching a good way of limiting `merkleblock` responses.\n",

There are many stellar examples to be considered of developers responding gracefully and without presumption to the lowly, poorly-written inquiries of new users who have zero posts logged with a given project; of which I have been the personal beneficiary, and therefore left with the option a) to expound, b) to appropriately respond or c) to withdraw without feeling personally attacked)",

A key issue is that in the process of a full node being fully unrestricted, there are a few different calls which are made by the client and its peers to the system or the bitcoin network, any one of or series of which could be causing a performance decrease, stall or crash in an almost endless variety of ways on the host machine.\r\n\r\nShould a generally unobtrusive and intuitive solution to this issue be found. it would be nice if a) this issue were closed (for the benefit of the denser of us laymen who can't read between the lines), and b) that solution were regularly cited for the relieving sake of those of us who would genuinely and enthusiastically appreciate being able to spend more time building or creating, versus dwindling, searching, or defending (albeit poor) attempts to draw attention to a long-lingering, impacting issue.\r\n\r\nAnd should there be strong reason to maintain this feature as \"necessary\", such as sound arguments about bitcoin integrity or security, then it would benefit us to have those reasons regularly cited, posted, or linked, and for this issue to be closed.",

      "body": "This issue was created in 2011, when global average internet speeds according to [Akamai](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2012/04/akamai-study-finds-uk-average-broadband-speeds-fell-to-4-9mbps-in-2011.html) were 2.3MBit/s.\r\n\r\nSince then global average speeds have increased substantially (according to[ M-Lab and cable.co.uk](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2022/09/uk-jumps-to-35th-out-of-224-countries-for-broadband-speed-in-2022.html)) to 34.79MBit/s with many countries having well over 100MBit/s or even 1000MBit/s available to consumers, in conjunction with proliferation of 4 and 5G high speed wireless networks with equivalent speeds.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Bitcoin blockchain has grown from 0.19GB to the current (Oct 2022) ~450GB which puts more strain on network nodes during the IBD phase, something that cannot really be sidestepped in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nTechnologies such as compact blocks (BIP152) have been introduced which, for tx-relaying nodes, the authors [claim](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki#protocol-design) can relay blocks 90% of the time without having to request any missing transactions, sharply reducing the bandwidth spikes reported above which used to occur during moments of new block relay. Note that if  user has configured their node to run in `-blocksonly` mode (to reduce total bandwith by something in the order of ~80% by disablilng transaction relay) they will not be able to benefit from compact blocks bandwidth peak reduction during block relay, as they have no mempool to reconstruct the block from.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this [Erlay](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21515) is edging towards completion and also claims to reduce bandwidth significantly, although it's currently unclear if it will meet it's initial claim of 40%. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/7).\r\n\r\nIt is made clear in the comments above that bandwidth limitations on nodes serving historical blocks (listening nodes) is not desirable for the health of the network as a whole, regardless of whether this node wants to feel altruistic by \"giving something back to the network\".\r\n\r\nTherefore I conclude that, unless there is a clear proposal here detailing exactly how bandwidth should be further limited in Bitcoin Core, we should finally close this issue. Because in addition to having on average significantly more bandwidth available today, nodes have the following options available to them to configure depending on their specific circumstances:\r\n\r\n| Measure | Notes |  Reduce total | Limit block spikes\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Compact blocks (enabled) | block tx set reconcilliation from mempool | ✔️ | ✔️ |\r\n|  `maxuploadtarget` | limit total upload bandwith per 24h | ✔️ | ❌ |\r\n| `-listen=0` | no incoming connections | ✔️ | ❌ |\r\n| `-blocksonly=1` |  total bandwith reduction of ~80% | ✔️ | ❌ |\r\n| Reduce `maxconnections=` | go lower than the default of 10 + 2 outbound peers | ✔️ | ❌ |\r\n| Software bandwidth monitor | e.g. Trickle, per process or interface | ✔️ | ✔️ |\r\n| Router bandwidth monitor | affests all host traffic  | ✔️ | ✔️ |\r\n| (Future) Erlay | reduces duplicate relay | ✔️ | ❌ |\r\n\r\nWhilst not _all_ the options are compatible with each other, I believe that there is a working combination here for most operators.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it there will remain one case which cannot be covered by Bitcoin Core program options alone (i.e. without using software of router bandwidth monitors), which is limiting peak rate during IBD. Bitcoin Core will still see your node use up it's `maxuploadtarget` quota as soon as it can, before limiting itself.",
