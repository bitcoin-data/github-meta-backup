    "body": "By default, bitcoin core has minRelayTxFee of '0.00001000' or 1000 satoshi per 1000 bytes.\r\n\r\nThis should be the same as 250 satoshi per kiloweight, but it's *not* since it internally uses vbytes (which *rounds up*).  As a result, modern (segwit-only) software must perform hacks to ensure that it generates transactions which propagate, and authors write angsty, whiny commit messages:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/commit/2e687b9b352c9092b5e8bd4a688916ac50b44af0\r\n\r\n## What behavior did you expect?\r\n\r\nTransactions with exactly 250 satoshi per kilosipa should propagate.\r\n\r\n## What was the actual behavior?\r\n\r\nOnly one in four transactions like this will propagate, the rest will be rejected.",

You can't just say \"bitcoin uses weight now, not bytes\"; You have\nto know *both*.

Adding \"vbytes\" fields was contaminated thinking, but it's too late\n   now.\n2. I agree that such a change would be invasive and hard; in particular\n   care would be needed that these rules got looser, not tighter, and other\n   nodes wouldn't start banning new nodes who fwd txs they consider\n   nonstandard, and I'm sure other things I haven't thought of.\n3. minRelayTxFee, dust logic, transaction replacement and IsStandard()\n   are APIs which upper layers (like lightning) need to know; though I\n   hate that.  They should be as clear as possible and not changed\n   without broad consultation; certainly not tightened.\n\nSince I consider stuff-on-top-of-Bitcoin to be at an early phase, I\nconsider simplifying these APIs to be important to avoid contaminating\neverything up-stack with legacy.\n\n",
