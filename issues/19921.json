    "body": "Earlier I was importing several thousands of private keys to Bitcoin Core and it took much time, especially rescan of the blockchain. Few hours, >3 surely.\r\n\r\nBut now, when I am importing 151M private keys (10 GB file with keys) the import process is now taking 2 days and I have 65% for now.\r\n\r\nHow badly Bitcoin Core is written is unbelivable. There is no other way to scan such an amount of keys, because other apps are for private, limited use and do not offer scanning the blockchain with such a large amount of keys.\r\n\r\nWill this be fixed or even rewritten?",

      "body": "IMO, the Bitcoin Core wallet is not designed to hold 151M private keys. It does probably work if you have the necessary RAM and disk requirements, but it's certainly not optimised for that case.\r\n\r\n> How badly Bitcoin Core is written is unbelivable. There is no other way to scan such an amount of keys, because other apps are for private, limited use and do not offer scanning the blockchain with such a large amount of keys.\r\n> \r\n> Will this be fixed or even rewritten?\r\n\r\nThis is up to you. It looks like you have strong interest that large amounts of keys work smoothly. I suggest you either start benchmarking and optimising Core or that you'll find and pay someone that is willing to do that.",
