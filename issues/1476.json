    "body": "Posted this on bitcointalk:\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=80187.msg962781#msg962781\nWhen sending coins from one of your addresses to another one of your addresses, the client only displays an entry saying \"transaction to yourself\" without listing the amount or the from/to address.\nWhile this isn't a bug, it makes keeping track of your coins difficult. Blockchain.info for example lists the transaction just like every other one; I suggest that the client should do the same.\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=80187.msg969520#msg969520\nI sent some coins (using coincontrol) from one of my addresses (A) to another person (B) and decided to send the leftover amount (essentially the change) to one of my addresses (C).\nThe transaction to the other user just shows up fine in the transactions tab, however the one to myself is missing in the list.\nSince the involved balances are all correct (A to B is ok, change went to C, A is empty), I assume it's just not displayed in the transaction list.\n",

Every transaction that doesn't spend the entire balance of a txout generates change, so showing this as transaction to yourself would result in a lot of noise (and thus confusion).\n",

You have to look up the tx-id on eg blockexplorer to figure out from where to where the transfer went. (I'm talking about weeks/months later obviously). Since I cannot add a comment to a tx, I have to track those in an extra file.\n\n2) I realize that normally change is not shown. However, this is not an automatic change, but a tx I created manually. It is more confusing to have a tx I created missing in the tx list. Especially when every other \"tx to self\" gets listed. I intentionally sent the entire balance of one address to two addresses to avoid an auto-change address.\n\nAs a possible solution auto-change should go back to the same address where it originated from.\n",

I'll have to track those tx separately for now.\n\n2) Seeing that the client displays \"to self\" transactions (when moving all coins from address A to B) I assumed that it would do the same when only a part of the coins is moved from A to B while most goes to another user C. Like, one line for A to C and one for A to B. I thought that there's maybe some sort of \"donotshow\" flag or something.\n\nWould it be complex to add an option to let the user select whether to use a new address or the input address for storing change?\n",
