    "title": "Pathing Guide for Installation using macOS",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nYes. One common problem with software setups is the pathing is corrupted. Proper pathing is one of the most important parts of getting started with any new software because if the path is depreciated the software will not properly run. This is the problem I am currently working on with Bitcoin. I downloaded the software but am unable to interact with the network.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# In\r\nbitcoin-cli getblocktemplate '{\"rules\": [\"segwit\"]}'\r\n# Out\r\nzsh: command not found: bitcoin-cli\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be clear instructions on how to install and get started using Bitcoin software that did not require extensive knowledge of software systems architecture and pathing. A great installation method would automatically install the software along the right path to prevent the pathing problem. A generalized solution would be really good, providing a clear guide to solving the pathing problem on any machine.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI've researched solving the problem in the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5365321.0) and on [StackOverflow](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/43148/bitcoin-cli-not-found-on-osx). However, because this common problem is so unique to each local machine, a clear or generalized solution is hard to develop. One specific solution I tried from my research was to add additional context to the command.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# In\r\n> curl --user username --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\": \"curltest\", \"method\": \"getblocktemplate\", \"params\": [{\"rules\": [\"segwit\"]}]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/\r\n# Out\r\n> curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 8332: Connection refused\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the command resulted in a connection refusal. I found a possible solution in the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5155612.0), but the problem with the proposed solution is that there is no `bitcoin.conf` file in the main Bitcoin repository. I found a `config` folder in the `src` directory, but there is no `bitcoin.conf` file. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI am running on MacOS. Thank you in advance for your attention and advice.\r\n",

I saw #[22235](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22235) was merged on May 4th, but I am working on a download of bitcoin core from yesterday, so my download should be completely up to date. I ran your code.\r\n\r\nIn:\r\n`% contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-conf.sh`\r\n\r\nOut:\r\n```\r\nfatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\r\n/src/bitcoind not found or not executable.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoving forward: \r\n1) I think it makes more sense to have `bitcoin.conf` in the main repository rather than being buried deep in the `share/examples/` directory because burying it would make it difficult to call and add complexity; and\r\n2) It probably makes sense to focus on a solution to the core pathing problem, rather than doing a work around.\r\n",

The first instruction suggests macOS comes with a built in terminal.\r\n\r\n`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`\r\n\r\nWhen I ran the command from the home directory, I got an error.\r\n\r\nIN:\r\n`cd /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`\r\n\r\nOUT:\r\n`cd: no such file or directory: Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app\r\n`\r\n\r\nAfter digging through the GUI on my machine, I found that `terminal.app` is visible in the `Utilities` folder, which is not showing to exist when I run from the terminal in VSCode.\r\n\r\nI went ahead with the build instructions anyway and found `./src/bitcoind`. The macOS Build Guide says it could take days to download the blockchain, but I have already completed this download. However, I downloaded Bitcoin Core earlier this year and have the GUI from the [Bitcoin Core Website](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/). It is located in my `Applications` folder, but I have yet to find a way to access it from the terminal or interact with the underlying software. \r\n\r\n1. Is it necessary to download the blockchain twice to make software contributions?\r\n2. What is the reason that the `Applications` folder appears empty through the terminal, but full of applications through the GUI?\r\n3. How do I access Bitcoin Core in the `Applications` folder for the purpose of software development?\r\n\r\n",

Please let me know, do you know of any technical reasons for this requirement? Otherwise, I completed PR #26787 to solve **2** and **3** above.\r\n\r\nRegarding **1** the solution is still not clear.

To be clear, the pathing problem refers to problems in installing the software with a proper path for running and contributing code. I did my best to describe the problem, so if you're still having issues on clarity or the words seem like a mish-mash, you may want to get checked for [dyslexia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia), a disease a lot of really smart people have that makes it difficult to derive clear meaning from otherwise cogent text.\r\n\r\nThe text of this thread is designed to create a clear path, address problems, and ultimately a solution for proper installation on macOS. The request will be resolved when I have added the feature and made the proper contribution. Ultimately, this thread adds a lot of value to the network by identifying and addressing core software problems face by new developers and contributors to Bitcoin Core. Thanks!",

And, I asked what the difference was between usage and support? Without knowing how you define the words, I don't know what you think they mean. \r\n\r\nYes. The issue is that there is no clear way to correctly install the bitcoin software with clear pathing on macOS. The issue stems from issues in downloading software to macOS generally, especially with the new M1 chip. The goal is to provide a clear download mechanism to allow developers to get started building faster. I've been working on this problem for about four days now and still am not able to run `./bitcoind`.",

I think the answer to the first two questions is no. The answer to the third question is maybe. I want to install Bitcoin Core, so I can receive information on new blocks and submit information to the network to help validate blocks. To do that, I think I have to download the blockchain and then run programs from the CLI as defined in the [Bitcoin Core Documentation](https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/0.21.0/rpc/blockchain/getbestblockhash/). I could be wrong. \r\n\r\nThe problem I am running into is with installation on macOS because the path is consistently corrupted. Now, the broader problem is a lack of storage on my machine. So, I may move forward with an external hard drive next, which I think may help to prevent the problem generally. \r\n\r\nYes. I agree and I think the recent updates with the M1 chip cause additional problems and they are generally incompatible with many other OSS libraries. So, one goal for this request is to help fix the current documentation. I will check my home directory to explore possible alternatives and identify the root cause for this issue. Once I have more information, I will report back here. Thank you again.",
