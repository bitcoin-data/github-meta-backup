    "body": "A more detailed proposal can be found here: https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'd like to talk about the desirability of an `assumeutxo` feature, which would allow much faster node bootstrapping in the spirit of `assumevalid`. For those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's an informal description from [one of last year's meetings](https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03-07-priorities/):\r\n\r\n> \"Assume UTXO\" is an idea similar to assumevalid. In assumevalid, you have a hash that is hard-coded into the code, and you assume all the blocks in the chain that ends in that hash, that those transactions have valid scripts. This is an optimization for startup to not have to do script checks if you're willing to believe that the developers were able to properly review and validate up to that point. You could do something similar, where you cache the validity of the particular UTXO set, and it's ACKed by developers before updating the code. Anyone can independently recompute that value. There's some nuanced considerations for this [...]. The downside if you fuck up is bigger. In assumevalid, you can trick someone into thinking the block is valid if it wasn't, and assumeutxo you might be able to create coins or something; there are definitely different failure modes. So there're different security implications here. You could use assumeutxo, but you could go back and double check later. But there's nuance about how this should be done or how. You could have nodes that export this value, [and so one attack might be] you could lie to your friend I guess, but that's less scary than other things.\r\n\r\nIn other words, assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n\r\nThis would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly from a ~3GB file (at time of writing) rather than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip.  Needless to say this is at expense of operating under a different trust model (albeit temporarily), though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nAn implementation of assumeutxo could allow background validation of the loaded UTXO snapshot to happen concurrently with use of the assumed chain, so the trust model is only relaxed for a limited amount of time. Conceptually this is pretty straightforward: you'd have two chainstates maintained simultaneously, one of which is doing an IBD from genesis up to the base of the snapshot and the other (i.e. the assumed chain) just doing tip maintenance and servicing immediate requests for chain data. Once the validation chainstate reaches the height of the snapshot base, it computes a hash of the UTXO set it built and compares it to the snapshot's hash. If it matches, we throw the validation chainstate away and continue to operate on the \"assumed\" (but now fully validated) chain - otherwise we pitch a fit in the logs and GUI, and either revert to the validation chainstate and continue traditional IBD or simply shutdown.\r\n\r\n## Specifying assumeutxo\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo value/height pairings could be committed in much the [same way that we currently update assumevalid](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15429). Eventually (and this is not a new idea) we could consider using a [rolling UTXO set hash](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014337.html) or some similar technology to commit to the UTXO set hash in each block header, though this of course ends up being a consensus change. This would obviate the need for any hardcoded assumeutxo value since bootstrapping nodes could obtain the headers chain, choose a UTXO set hash value at some height, and then obtain the correspondent UTXO snapshot from their peers on the basis of that hash.\r\n \r\n## Obtaining snapshots\r\n\r\nSnapshots could be obtained from a variety of sources, whether over the peer network or centralized content distribution networks (CDNs). It doesn't really matter since security is contingent on a content hash, though if assumeutxo ends up being something we actually want to support then I'd imagine we would build a means of distribution through the peer network.\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n\r\nI've already drafted up an implementation of this that excludes any P2P mechanism for distributing snapshots but makes the changes necessary for loading snapshots and doing concurrent background validation. It exposes two new RPC commands, `dumptxoutset` and `loadtxoutset`, to provide a test harness for creating and loading snapshots. Whether or not we'd actually want to commit that RPC interface is something I'd like input on. \r\n\r\nAnother option is to eschew a `loadtxoutset` RPC and use a `-utxosnapshot=<path>` startup parameter.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, supposing we get that far, we'll probably want to think about implementing P2P distribution of snapshots, and then maybe starting thinking about a rolling UTXO set hash for potential inclusion in block headers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nI'm curious for general opinions on this idea and the concrete implementation steps. If this ends up being desirable for the project, it'll require a lot of refactoring and will probably result in a lengthy succession of incremental PRs (*a la* the process separation effort), though I am of course happy to propose large, cohesive diffs too. :)\r\n\r\nSpecific questions I have are:\r\n\r\n1. Does the assumeutxo trust model differ materially from assumevalid? If so, how? Is it too aggressive a departure from our existing trust model?\r\n1. If we agree this is a feature worth supporting, does the sequence of \"RPC commands -> hardcoded assumeutxo value, optional use, P2P distribution -> UTXO rolling set hash block header commitment\" make sense?",

      "body": "I think this is materially different from `-assumevalid`, because there are additional safety features built into assumevalid that are not possible (as of now) for assumeutxo: assumevalid must be a block hash in a headers chain that has overall valid POW and is covered in two weeks worth of POW on top of the assumevalid block. Also, all utxo operations (adding and removing coins) before assumevalid must be fully valid except for the script check, which is optionally skipped. So you couldn't create coins out of thin air with assumevalid.\r\nassumeutxo does not have those \"belt and suspenders\". So if an assumeutxo hash is put into the code base (after review), it must not be possible for a user to simply pass in (either by mistake or consciously) their own hash via command line argument or otherwise.",

You would include the tip block hash in the data hashed for assumeutxo, and the UTXO set you receive would need to include that hash (stating which block it is for).

      "body": "I think James's proposal addresses many of the concerns that have been brought up. \r\n\r\nI think its worth noting that the solution to the \"one practical security difference\" in phase 1 or 2, is not resilient in an adversarial environment. This could be solved by having a client ask all of its connections to verify that the UTXO snapshot is correct, and if any one of its connections says the UTXO set isn't correct, the client would then the client would build the UTXO set from scratch. However, it would be easy for an attacker to force many or even most newly connecting clients to build it from scratch - which defeats the purpose of the upgrade (ie scalability). Assumevalid doesn't have this problems since verifying claims about chain validity is much easier than verifying claims about UTXO set validity. Phase 3 solves the problem in a much nicer way. \r\n\r\n> So you couldn't create coins out of thin air with assumevalid.\r\n> assumeutxo does not have those \"belt and suspenders\".\r\n\r\nEven if we allow the user enter a golden UTXO hash, I believe \r\n\r\n> if it comes to Bitcoin Core internals, we should not allow backdoors and footguns. For example allowing users to modify consensus settings on the command line\r\n\r\nI agree. And so does Pieter Wuille: \"[allowing [utxo snapshots] to be configured is even more scary (e.g. some website saying \"speed up your sync, start with this command line flag!\").](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/bt0yb3/hardcoded_utxo_checkpoints_are_an_enormous/eosxsbb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\". If all 3 phases of jamesob's are implemented tho, allowing the user to input a UTXO snapshot would be safe, since the client could efficiently verify the truth of the claim and ignore it if its not true.",

However it's probably still not equivalent to the current assumevalid situation. The hardcoded assumevalid block hash doesn't imply data availability, the burdensome blockchain downloading is actually validating data availability without trusting the developers who specified such hash. AFAIK data availability is the main reason why fraud proofs can't work.",

Satoshi's whitepaper described that although SPV client cannot validate transactions on its own, it may still receive alarms from fully validating nodes, which points them to the position where something invalid appears, so that SPV client can then download & verify the pointed blocks on its own, to avoid blindly following an invalid chain with more PoW.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a transaction spends a spent coin once again, a fraud proof which consists of Merkle proofs of both the original transaction and the double-spending invalid transaction can be sent to SPV clients, then SPV clients can validate such proof without downloading blockchain, so finally SPV clients will know it's an invalid chain which shouldn't be followed.\r\n\r\nWe can see that the fraud proofs were supposed to work just like \"supervision by public opinion\" in real life, and even better, it was supposed to be \"fact-based\" rather than \"opinion-based\", because the fraud proofs were supposed to be succint, and, verifiable without the gigantic blockchain data.\r\n\r\nWith the help of fraud proofs, SPV was supposed to work almostly as secure as a fully validating node.\r\n\r\nHowever, such strategy has a fatal flaw: to generate a fraud proof, the invalid part of the block must be known in first place. If some part of a block can't be downloaded, you can't convince other people that it's impossible to fully download such block, other people must try downloading it on their own to see whether it's truly undownloadable.\r\n\r\nFor example, a normal valid block has its own Merkle tree, where each leaf node is hash of a valid transaction. If you put something which isn't a hash at all (so that it doesn't have any known preimage) into the Merkle tree, then nobody can provide the \"full block data\". Fully validating nodes won't accept such malformed blocks, but SPV clients will still blindly accept Merkle proofs of such malformed blocks. Fully validating nodes can't prove it's malformed either, at best SPV clients still needs to try downloading the specified block on their own, which on the other side becomes a DoS vector that attacker can send false alarms to trick SPV clients into downloading existing (valid) blocks, wasting their bandwidth, so that the goal of lightweight SPV client is destroyed.\r\n\r\nBack to the topic of fully validating node which just skips downloading the gigantic historical blockchain data: as long as you don't validate all blocks before the UTXO snapshot, you won't know whether some similar invalid/malformed things sneaked into those \"unknown\" blocks. You can't hope someone will alert you either, because you won't know whether it's a false alarm. With the default assumevalid situation, although you don't fully verify the contents of historical blocks either, it's still theoretically (it's theoretical for now, because there are cases which need some currently missing additional commitment structure, like: spending never existed UTXOs) possible to generate a fraud proof which contains objectively irrefutable evidence proving some block is violating the consensus rules.",

The bandwidth needed is small, even for lightweight SPV nodes. \r\n\r\n> a DoS vector that attacker can send false alarms to trick SPV clients into downloading existing (valid) blocks, wasting their bandwidth\r\n\r\nThat's true, however there is already a way of dealing with bad behavior from connected nodes: disconnect from them. As long as the network of SPV servers is decentralized and honest nodes compose a significant fraction of those SPV servers, there's a pretty low limit of possible shenanigans. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's say your pool of SPV servers consists of 70% honest nodes, and 30% malicious actors. If your SPV node is connecting to 10 SPV servers, an average of 3 of them will be malicious and can send 3 fake fraud claims that results in 3 (extra) blocks of download. After disconnecting from those 3 jokers, an average of 1 of the 3 new SPV servers they connect to will be malicious, resulting in a 4th extra block download. The last new SPV node would not usually be malicious. That's 4 extra blocks, that hardly destroys the goal of having a lightweight node. \r\n\r\nSo even if you have a massive fraction of malicious nodes, you can't realy troll SPV nodes that hard as long as they're following best practices and disconnecting from nodes that give them bad data. \r\n\r\n> as long as a typical PC with common Internet connection is still able (not \"required\", \"forced\" etc) to fully validate the entire blockchain, skipping downloading the old blocks would be fine\r\n\r\nI think its very important that the Bitcoin community come to a consensus around bounadaries of what we consider \"safe\" as far as resource usage. What is the minimum resources of that \"typical PC with a common internet connection\"? If we need to support practical verifiability of the entire chain on  below-average machines with below average resources, we need to limit the blockchain's grow much more than if we decided we only need to support practical verifiability of the entire chain by \"average or better\" machines etc. Once we decide on the power of machines we think we need to support, we can then [calculate how big blocks can safely be](https://github.com/fresheneesz/bitcoinThroughputAnalysis).",

      "body": ">Valid uses of this would be extraordinarily rare. Even 1 block per year would be far more frequent than is at all likely. The bandwidth needed is small, even for lightweight SPV nodes.\n\nJust one rule-breaking transaction could already be catastrophic - like, minting 1 trillion coins out of thin air (it could be done through many ways, like, spending nonexistent UTXOs).\n\nIt's not about bargaining over bandwidth either. The point was that you can't know whether the alarm you received is a malicious false alarm. Even if you see a block failed to be downloaded, you can't convince others - \"oh, must be a temporary network connectivity issue, maybe you should just try again?\"\n\n>As long as the network of SPV servers is decentralized and honest nodes compose a significant fraction of those SPV servers\n\nJust like what Satoshi's whitepaper had outlined:\n\n>If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone\rable to allocate many IPs.\n\nMiners are not naturally honest or selfless - it's on the contrary expected for them to behave greedily, selfishly and rationally. Miners are just incentivised to behave honestly under the constraints of consensus rules, or in other words, game theory.\n\nMiners respect the consensus rules because they know other people will verify the blocks they mined according those rules - if they dare to let anything violating the rules sneak in, then no one will accept their hard-mined (costs expensive electricity in real world) block. \n\n(To be honest, AFAIK, there are disagreements around this point - some people believe that only miners should verify the blocks, while some other people believe that it's not only miners but the economic majority should also always verify the blocks)\n\n>I think its very important that the Bitcoin community come to a consensus around bounadaries of what we consider \"safe\" as far as resource usage. What is the minimum resources of that \"typical PC with a common internet connection\"? If we need to support practical verifiability of the entire chain on below-average machines with below average resources, we need to limit the blockchain's grow much more than if we decided we only need to support practical verifiability of the entire chain by \"average or better\" machines etc.\n\nAgreed.",

The rare event I was talking about in a bitcoin with fraud proofs would be where a majority of mining power tried to fork the blockchain in ways that would fool SPV nodes. If fraud proofs were in place, this would not only be incredibly difficult to pull of (as it would be without fraud proofs), but would also be unsuccessful. Without fraud proofs, such a scenario could succeed, and it could be catestrophic. \r\n\r\n> The point was that you can't know whether the alarm you received is a malicious false alarm. \r\n\r\nThat's simply not true. You download the accused block, you validate it, and then you know.\r\n\r\n> Even if you see a block failed to be downloaded, you can't convince others - \"oh, must be a temporary network connectivity issue, maybe you should just try again?\"\r\n\r\nIf a node can't download a block, then its invalid, full stop. You don't accept that a block is valid if you can't download it. Why would you? If someone can't download it, they should be very convinced that its not a valid block until shown otherwise. \r\n\r\n> In the end the alarm is still going to be ignored.\r\n\r\nIf you program the SPV node software to not ignore that, it won't be ignored.

      "body": "(from IRC)\r\n\r\n> \\<jamesob> Do we ever expect to support an index that actually requires sequential indexing? Jimpo's BaseIndex advertises that it will index sequentially, but at the moment none of the particular indexers require this. Furthermore, we will have BlockConnected events triggering indexing out of order once we start using background chainstates for assumeutxo\r\n\r\nI don't think it affects when you're doing here, but I think of wallets as mini-indexes requiring sequential indexing. Wallets need to  scan blocks in sequential order so the [`IsFromMe`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/10eb000409a284b35b421818a11168adadaad4bd/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L1046) check in `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe`) will work. Eventually after #15719 I think wallets and indexes should use the same `interfaces::Chain` sync / rescan / block connected / rewind interface and hooks and work more efficiently together",

      "body": "Regarding bootstrapping a pruned node from a full-node, the way I'd do it is to bitcoin-cli the running node to stop it accepting any more blocks or transactions, copy --reflink=always the block index and chainstate to a new bitcoind instance, bitcoin-cli the running node to resume accepting blocks and transactions, modify the new instance to use new ports, and enable pruning, and run it, wait for it to prune the block index, and then exit, and voila, I have a ready to copy bitcoind instance that I can install elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure it needs to be much more complicated than this, although ideally a way to do it without suspending activity on the main instance would be nice, but hardly worth it given the relatively little downtime the above method causes.",
