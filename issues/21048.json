Please stop opening these issues.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @fanquake in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21047#issuecomment-770529201_\r\n\r\nWhy are you silencing my issues? Is this not the main repository for bitcoin? BTC can't keep charging $17 per transaction, and think that we're going to do any good here. Many users can't move hundreds of dollars frozen in wallets with small outputs at the current price...  To say that this isn't a bug is pretty much looking the other way... The price changed, let's lower the network fees accordingly. \r\n\r\nWe're causing a bubble that's on its way to becoming an atom bomb ðŸ’£ if the price continues to rise the fees will not be manageable to many users and the fees are already causing problems for many users. We encourage users to buy fractions, and they can't move fractions of BTC without significant loss. 33% up to 50% will be lost for small output wallets and you think this isn't a bug? This is a problem that needs to be addressed.\r\n",
