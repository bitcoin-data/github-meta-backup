      "body": "If you have a long-running bitcoind instance, it is better to not set mintxfee or paytxfee.\n\nIf you do not set paytxfee, an estimate of the fees on the network is used to determine the fee amount since 0.12. You can also do this manually by calling `estimatesmartfee blocks`, with blocks the number of blocks you're willing to wait for confirmation. Note that this value may go higher than what you're used to during peaks of high activity.\n\nAlso note that the argument to paytxfee is in fees per kilobyte, and not an absolute amount. This means that if you set it to 0.0001, and a transaction is 270 bytes, it will set the fee to 0.000027. This is what you need, as miners select by fee per byte as well, but it can be unintuitive.\n\nYou should not ever set mintxfee.\n",
