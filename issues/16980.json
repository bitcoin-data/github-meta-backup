Basically the only way to do this is using bitcoin-tx outputaddr command, but there's no native way using bitcoin-cli (RPC)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThere're are 2 solutions to this approach:\r\n- (non breaking) Add \"addoutputaddr\" method to bitcoin-cli that accepts {\"address\":\"value\"} and does the same as outputaddr command\r\n- (breaking) Using a different syntax for JSON in createrawtransaction that comply with JSON-RPC when sending to duplicate addresses\r\nexample: [{\"address\": \"bitcoinAddress\", \"amount\": \"btcAmount\"}, {..}, ..]\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- Currently only alternative is using bitcoin-tx, which is not an option is one is communicating with the node using RPC only",
