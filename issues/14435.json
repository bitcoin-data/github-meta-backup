    "body": "<!-- Describe the issue -->\r\nIn v0.16.2 and before, when I selected in the GUI, File - Receiving Addresses, the screen that came up listed all created receiving addresses for my wallet with a button on the bottom left labeled \"New\" to create new manual receiving addresses. Now in v0.17.0, there is no \"New\" button on the Receiving Addresses screen. However, on the Send Addresses screen, there is still a \"New\" button to create manual send addresses.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\"New\" button to be on the screen to create manual receive addresses without having to go to console and create the new receive address via the command line and then return to the GUI.\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\nScreenshot of Receiving and Sending Addresses screens attached so you can see no \"New\" button on Receiving screen but still on the Sending screen.\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\nEvery time on v.0.17.0\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nv0.17.0\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nMacBook Air running macOS Mojave\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-08 at 5 43 51 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40723353/46635957-28e29800-cb24-11e8-8e9f-4b5d73c1cdc6.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-08 at 5 44 05 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40723353/46635958-28e29800-cb24-11e8-95af-1d9f0aaabdb3.png)\r\n\r\n",
