    "title": "Feature discussion: partial descriptors/miniscript",
    "body": "So far, we effectively have two levels of \"solvability\" in descriptors:\r\n* `addr()` and `raw()` which can encode scriptPubKey with effectively no solvability information at all\r\n* Everything else, which encodes scriptPubKeys that are fully solvable.\r\n\r\nI've long held that there shouldn't be any level in between, in the sense that you shouldn't be using a descriptor if you don't know everything about its construction. I'm starting to think that's not a tenable position:\r\n* Already, key origin information - which may be no less critical than other parts of descriptors for certain roles - is optional. There is no way to force that information to be included, because it may not exist (for non-BIP32-derived keys, for example), but it may also simply be omitted.\r\n* #23480 proposes the introduction of a descriptor like `tr()`, except it encodes the post-tweak key rather than the inner key. This too may be because the information doesn't exist, but it cannot prevent situations where it is simply omitted.\r\n* It has been suggested before (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21365#issuecomment-793027851) to permit `tr()` descriptors to contain hashes for omitted script subtrees. That too could represent non-existent information (Merkle path entries that are chosen rather than actual hashes), or omitted information. And it is useful - there are certainly scenarios where one might want to participate in, and sign for, taproot outputs for which certain subtrees are not known.\r\n* If we're going to accept that the previous 3 examples will occur, we might as well bite the bullet and also add a way to encode \"pkh with known keyhash, but not known key\".\r\n\r\nIf all these mechanisms become permitted in descriptors (and miniscript), we get the nice logistical benefit of being able to represent all information extracted from PSBT/SPKM/scripts/... into a descriptor regardless of what is present or missing. I believe this would logistically simplify things later on too: Miniscript would not need separate instantiations for its descriptor-decoding use case and its signing/solving use case. Perhaps even further out, this can mean that many fields in `SignatureData` are replaced with just a descriptor object (everything except signatures/preimages), and the signing logic becomes a descriptor method.\r\n\r\nStraw man proposal:\r\n* Do #23480 (adding `rawtr(KEY)`), for P2TR outputs with specified tweaked key, but no specified internal key or script tree.\r\n* Add a `rawnode(HEX)` fragment, only usable inside P2TR script tree expressions, indicating a tree node with specified hash, but no specified subtree.\r\n* Add a `rawpkh(HEX)` fragment, usable wherever `pkh(KEY)` is usable, indicating a PKH script (`DUP HASH160 <hex> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG`), without specified public key. Post-miniscript this would also add a `rawpk_h(HEX)` fragment, corresponding to `pk_h(KEY)`.\r\n\r\n",

That is, make it explicit that pubkeys may be available, or not, and that this may be different for different `pk_h`s in the same descriptor.\r\n\r\nSimilarly taptrees would be `(TapTreeHash, Option<TapTree>)` etc",

      "body": "@ryanofsky Slow response but:\r\n\r\n> Curious if there was a specific rationale or concern behind the previous position, or if it just seemed simpler at the time\r\n\r\nMy thinking used to be that descriptor's goal was to encapsulate full knowledge of \"how to spend an output, excluding private keys\", with `addr`/`raw` as exceptions added specifically for the purpose of allowing `scantxoutset` to work with raw scripts/addresses. But there didn't seem to be a use case for anything in between \"know everything\" (normal descriptors) and \"know nothing except the scriptPubKey\" (raw/addr), because such an in-between thing would be useless for everything except scanning, and thus all the information it would have beyond what raw/addr provide would be redundant.\r\n\r\nI've come around because I'm convinced now there *are* use cases for these in-between situations. At least internally, signing is definitely possible, and useful, even with partial knowledge. Imagine a 2-of-2 script that's (abusing notation here) `and(pkh(A),pkh(B))` (so something where the script has pubkey hashes of two keys). If an output to such a script exists, and you have the private key to `A`, but don't have even the unhashed public key to `B`, you do want to participate in signing. With the introduction of taproot, this notion is even extended, where you may be able to individually know enough to spend according to one branch fully, but not know anything about other branches. The current miniscript final PR bypasses descriptors for its signing logic, and effectively uses a different layer (the Key type template in miniscript) to represent this partial knowledge *without* needed descriptors to represent that. That's another sign that there may be (even only \"internal\") use cases where it would greatly help to permit just everything in descriptors.\r\n\r\nAnd if we're going to need to add more \"exceptions\" anyway because there are use cases demanding them, that's perhaps a sign the philosophy is wrong to begin with, and we should just embrace the fact that there can always be a spectrum of available knowledge, rather than think about every missing piece as an exception.",
