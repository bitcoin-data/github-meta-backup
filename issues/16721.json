    "title": "Discussion: Should the mempool.dat file be encrypted/XORed?",
    "body": "XORing the `mempool.dat` was discussed as early as 2016 in the same PR that implemented `loadMempool()` and `dumpMempool`. Back then @sipa wrote:\r\n\r\n> XORed dump is not implemented, this can be done later. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8448#issuecomment-257226360\r\n\r\n**Should the `mempool.dat` file be XORed with a random key similar to how the chainstate <s>`blk*.dat`</s> is? Is it possible to include something malicious in the `mempool.dat` that could actually cause problems?**\r\n\r\nA sample attack vector where XORing could help (tl;dr below): \r\nAttacker `A` broadcasts a transaction `T` with the minimum relay fee/mempool acceptance fee. This `T` contains _something malicious_ e.g. via an `OP_RETURN` output. Due to the low fee, `T` could stay in the mempool of a lot of nodes for a maximum of two weeks (assuming medium to high feerate levels in that period). If `A` times this correctly, (s)he could broadcast `T` as soon as new release is published. Node operators would stop (`dumpMempool()`), update to new version, and restart (`loadMempool()`) their node. `T` would be persisted on disk in the `mempool.dat` until `((T is mined || T is evicted) && node is restarted)` (at e.g. the next major release). Broadcasting such a `T` could be done cheaply for a few hundred satoshis and as often as one is willing to do.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to the question what could be the _malicious something_ in `T`. Since, unlike the chainstate <s>blk*.dat files</s>, the `mempool.dat` is not critically needed for Bitcoin Core to run, an anti-virus software blocking the file wouldn't be a major problem. However e.g. a government entity scanning a hard drive in e.g. airport security could be a problem.\r\n\r\n**tl;dr:** I think, if timed correctly, you could persist a transaction with _malicious content_ in quite a lot of `mempool.dat` files for only a few satoshis. The transaction would stay in the `mempool.dat` file untll the bitcoin node restarts, which quite possible could be a full release cycle. My question now is: **Is there something malicious that could actually oppose a threat, if persisted in the `mempool.dat` ?** \r\n\r\nThis is open for discussion. I don't have an answer. If XORing is needed, I might implement it and open a PR at a later stage. \r\n\r\nedit: I mean't the obfuscated chainstate (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6650) and not XORed `blk*.dat` files.
