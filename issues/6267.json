    "title": "Static Qt5 in Linux builds",
    "body": "I see the Linux builds for 0.11.0rc1 are statically linked to Qt5, where previously they were dynamically linked to Qt4. I'm glad for the upgrade, not so much the static linking. Is there a reason for this, and could it be referenced in the release notes? My argument against would be, unlike OpenSSL, it's not consensus critical, and it's more important to be consistent with the distribution for look and feel. I realize this would reduce support for older distro versions. Alternately, could the static build be updated to the latest Qt (5.4 instead of 5.2)?\n\nSpecific issues I'm seeing, under KDE 5 / Fedora 22:\n- Doesn't look like the system theme\n- Systray icon missing (KDE 5 dropped support for the old xembed systray in favor of the appindicator/status-notifier protocol; handled transparently in Qt 5.4 and distro-patched 4.8)\n\nI've compiled successfully against Qt 5.4.1, but can't actually test as Red Hat's lawyers are still hobbling secp256k1 in their OpenSSL package. Happy to test if an upstream build is done.\n",

      "body": "Because it's the most compatible option. I was against statically linking Qt first as well (because of the desktop integration problems), see discussion in #4284, but was eventually convinced because all the other options are even worse.\n\nGist of the matter is, that there is no good way to distribute portable GUI executables on Linux. Blame the weird ecosystem. Also now that libstdc++ is linked statically (another compatibility compromise, #5819) there is no other option than to link all c++ libraries as static.\n\nUpgrading the static Qt version is fine with me, if that helps anything. Should be straightforward - see `depends/packages/qt.mk`.\n",

      "body": "The Qt build system infers the default include path by parsing the output of g++ -v (qtbase/configure, line 3326, \"Auto-detect default include and library search paths\"). This is affected by the CPATH and QMAKE_CFLAGS settings in depends/packages/qt.mk. Simply deleting those works to get the top level include path back into the .pc files, but breaks the static OpenSSL linkage. What does work is to add the identical CPATH to the bitcoin build environment.\n\nTragically, after all that, the system theme and systray problems are still there. It would seem that the change in Qt 5.4 was not to automatically support the new systray, but rather just some refactoring that enabled KDE to hook into it via the system theme engine -- which only works with the shared Qt.\n\nI'll still PR my work on the version bump, but not for 0.11 -- no point holding up the schedule if it doesn't solve the problem.\n",
