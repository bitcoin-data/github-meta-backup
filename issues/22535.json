    "body": "It is not possible to enter a transaction while the gui is syncing, because its lagging. \r\nsometimes it is important to enter a transaction and go away and the transaction will only be fullfilled after the blockchain sync is finished. for that there needs to be a responsive button to on/off the sync. i know the network symbol is there, but it does work that laggy..thanks\r\nas a workaround i tried -connect=127.0.0.1\r\n\r\na simple fix would be a -startwithnosync option\r\n\r\nsame for \"processing blocks on disk\". everything is stuck.",

I am going to add such feature in one of my project so suggested it here.\r\n\r\nHere's the basic code one can use to try this in Bitcoin Core by adding in [`src/qt/modaloverlay.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/modaloverlay.cpp):\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n    QString year = QLocale{QLocale::English}.toString(blockDate, \"yyyy\");\r\n    \r\n    switch (year.toInt())\r\n    {\r\n    \r\n    case 2009:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2010:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2011:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2012:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2013:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2014:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2015:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2016:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2017:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2018:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2019:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2020:\r\n        break;\r\n    case 2021: ui->infoText->setText(tr(\"PR #### (author)\"));\r\n               ui->infoTextStrong->setText(tr(\"Short Description\"));\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n```",
