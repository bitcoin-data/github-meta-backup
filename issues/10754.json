    "body": "After #10192, we have two separate caches, which are in memory blocks of equal size. This is likely not the best possible tuning, but sadly its tricky to get right because the sigcache is now used more as a DoS protection/reorg speedup and less as a cache used in normal operation. See-also, @JeremyRubin's suggestion of using the same table and further discussion at, eg, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10192#issuecomment-313334895.",

I'd really like to understand how 8 way fanout is optimal, if it is, since that amount of memory latency should significantly slower than e.g. four way fanout into buckets of two esp with caches much larger than L3. Reports were that it wasn't which suggests to me that something is wrong, either in our implementation or in my understanding of the hardware, maybe our hash function is too slow and thats obscuring it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to look at is tuning the eviction/epoch counter part.",
