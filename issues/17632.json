In particular the section on [__refactoring__](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#refactoring), as it likely applies to changes generated with these tools:\r\n> Trivial pull requests or pull requests that refactor the code with no clear benefits may be immediately closed by the maintainers to reduce unnecessary workload on reviewing.\r\n\r\n__Disclaimer:__ These results have not been confirmed, and may be improbable or flat out invalid, but it's worth having a list of these somewhere and keep track of changes over time. The results may be subject to a large number of false positives and false negatives. The results are not necessarily complete. Please report if you see any spurious results that you think could be filtered out automatically in the next edition to reduce noise. This report is currently in beta: feedback welcome.\r\n\r\n### Functions that are both unused and untested\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>9 instances
