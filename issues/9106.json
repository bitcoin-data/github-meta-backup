    "title": "'estimatefee 1' is currently failing",
    "body": "When I run `estimatefee 1` right now, I get `-1` as the reply, meaning that it isn't possible to get a 95% chance of inclusion in the next block no matter what fee I include, but based on the collected mempool stats that isn't true.\r\n\r\nI traced the `TxConfirmStats::EstimateMedianVal()` call to see what was happening. It went like this:\r\n\r\nIn order to get \"enough transaction data points in this range of buckets\", it first grouped buckets 97 through 75 inclusive, found that their average confirm probability was 94.45% (below the 95% threshold), and so hit the `break` and stopped looking further.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that if it had looked at bucket 74 it would have had enough data points on its own, and would have had a probability of 95.51%, and so we could have returned a value of around 0.01 BTC.\r\n\r\nSo I'm seeing a 94.45% chance of confirmation in the next block if the fee is 0.01156269 or more per kB, and a 95.51% chance if the fee is in the range 0.01051153 - 0.01156269 per kB.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the code makes the assumption that higher fees always result in a higher probability, but that isn't actually the case.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be better to start at the cheapest bucket and work upwards, stopping at the first one that has a high enough probability, rather than stopping as soon as we find an expensive bucket with too low a probability? Otherwise it is possible for a small miner to sabotage fee estimation by targeting just one bucket. If he has 5% of the hash rate and refuses to confirm transactions in a particular expensive (0.01 BTC per kB) bucket he will ensure that the search stops at that bucket for all `estimatefee 1` calls. He can create enough such transactions to make the bucket statistically significant for less than 1 BTC per day which causing almost 'unlimited' damage to the usefulness of `estimatefee 1`.\r\n\r\nAlso, isn't 95% too high of a threshold when we see almost that many empty or nearly empty blocks? If I lower the threshold to 90% I see a much more reasonable result, of around 0.0006 BTC per kB for next-block confirmation. In [his original email](http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg06405.html) Alex wrote:\r\n\r\n> Since even the highest fee transactions are confirmed within the first block only 90-93% of the time, I decided to use 80% as my cutoff.\r\n\r\nThat seems like a reasonable argument. Why was the number [later changed from 85% to 95%](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f22ac4)?",

      "body": "@dooglus I originally played around with slightly \"smarter\" fee algorithms that started at the most expensive bucket but looked for the point of no return so to speak where the confirmation percentage dropped below the threshold never to return.  Every permutation I tried seemed susceptible to not being ideal in some particular circumstance or gameable, so it seemed better to err on the side of simpler.\n\nAs for starting from the cheapest bucket, we can't do that because then the gaming you posited could potentially happen in reverse causing the fee estimates of all targets above some minimum to become useless if a miner was indiscriminately including things in that low fee range.  For instance perhaps these are paid for out of band or were being confirmed by priority or some other mechanism..\n\nThe change from 85% to 95% was motivated by a desire to respond more quickly to changes in market conditions.  It's quite typical for there to be popular buckets that get tons of data points.  If for instance 97% of transactions in the 40 sat/byte bucket are being confirmed within 2 blocks and all of a sudden the mempool fills up and none get confirmed.  It could take many hours for the confirmation rate to drop below 85% especially because people will adjust quicker and stop giving new failing data points at that fee rate.\n\nIn general the fee estimation algorithm in Core is meant to be conservative.  It's the fee you should put on your transaction if you really want to be very sure your transaction will confirm in that target.  You can always see how much money you would save by selecting a longer target and realizing that you are likely to be confirmed sometime within that range, not necessarily at the end of it.  I would recommend never ever using 1 as a target.  \n\nAll that said, it is an art more than a science, and I welcome interest in people trying to improve it.\n",
