    "title": "What about a Garbage Collection Block ?",
    "body": "I wish I had the time to actually write a proof of concept but unfortunately I am still learning about v1 block. _(Time has literally stopped when I started suing the regulator.)_\r\n\r\n**My question is:** why couldn't we have every 144 blocks _(about once every 24 hours)_ a massive block that would contain everything in the mainpool 3 blocks before the time of the **Garbage Collection** ?\r\n\r\nSince this block would be special block, the nodes could try to recreate that block locally (using their mempool) by only being given the necessary ingredients to fill in the rest. \r\n\r\nBecause the cut off time is 3 block before, the nodes could start gathering the transaction of what will need to be gathered for that garbage block. An additional flag could be added to the mempool just for the node to start to force the miners of the content that will go into the garbage block.\r\n\r\nOnce a day, the garbage block would be the supreme block that the network would need to agree on. The nodes would have 30 minutes to come up with a HASH of the list of transactions that need to be in that block.\r\n\r\nThis would be a condition where multiple miners could literally find the answer to the block, but nothing move until the Garbage Block consensus is over. The intensive here is not to be the fastest but to clean up the garbage. The intensive would be for the miners to have it done has fast as possible to resume normal operations. (This block could have or not a coinbase.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don't know where to send this idea, so I am throwing it into the sea.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTheo Chino\r\narticle78againstNYDFS.com",
