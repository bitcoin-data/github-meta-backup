    "body": "Existing fuzz seeds are invalidated (i.e. may yield less code coverage) whenever the fuzz input \"format\" changes. Generally, this can happen whenever the behaviour of any executed code changes.\r\n\r\nIt would be nonsensical to hold back on changing Bitcoin Core code (e.g. validation code) to not invalidate fuzz inputs. Thus, we need to run a fuzz engine 24/7 to adapt the fuzz inputs to the latest code.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to avoid some seed invalidations when fuzz code (or other test code) is changed, I think, given that we already have to anticipate input invalidation, we don't need to spend resources to not invalidate fuzz inputs when fuzz code (or other test code) changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nFor example, a hypothetical (nonsensical) mempool fuzz target whose fuzz input format is a concatenation of `[serialized tx](optional: serialized nVersion)` and whose fuzz target code is: `while (data) { if (ATMP(tx = data.deserialize_tx())) { tx.nVersion = data.deserialize_int(); ATMP(tx); } }`, might have its fuzz inputs invalidated when ATMP behaviour changes.\r\n\r\nAs another example, a fuzz target whose fuzz input format is `[serialized bool][serialized tx or serialized int]` whose code is: `if (data.deserialize_bool()) { ATMP(data.deserialize_tx()); } else { SetMockTime(data.deserialize_int()); }`, ",

I have been wondering about what aspirational goal we should be aiming for in the future. An informal fuzzing \"team\" that would monitor when existing seeds are invalidated through changes to Core code. Or all long term contributors updating fuzz seeds when they invalidate them through opening a PR. At least in the short term the latter doesn't seem viable. A number of long term contributors are missing basic understanding of fuzzing currently.\r\n\r\nThe fuzz seeds are cheap to produce unless they have been carefully chosen. If there has been a lot of thought expended in choosing particular seeds this should be documented somewhere so that when invalidated they can be easily replaced. At the moment there doesn't seem to be much documentation on the thought process behind seeds in the [seed corpus](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/tree/master/fuzz_seed_corpus).",

      "body": "> A number of long term contributors are missing basic understanding of fuzzing currently.\r\n\r\nRunning the fuzzers should be straightforward: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md . Also, the concept of fuzzing isn't really that hard. However, the Bitcoin Core code base isn't \"optimized\" for fuzzing (e.g. globals, background threads, non-mockable disk access, net processing dealing also with deserialization ...), so working on fuzzers for Bitcoin Core sometimes becomes tricky. For general guidelines on writing fuzzers, you can take a look at https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/docs/intro-to-fuzzing.md\r\n\r\n> The fuzz seeds are cheap to produce unless they have been carefully chosen.\r\n\r\nCorrect. I think we should aim to write fuzzers that can explore the search space from scratch in a reasonable amount of time. Like mentioned before, this isn't the case for all Bitcoin Core fuzz targets. There are plenty of hashes, checksums, signatures, POW checks, serialization specifics ... etc that make it harder to find good fuzz inputs. Code coverage reports help in finding weak spots, and then specifically crafted seeds (either manually or extracted from real world data like the block files or socket buffers) can help to increase coverage.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity if those seeds get lost due to invalidation, and I think our best bet is to rely on the fuzz engine to translate them for us if it is possible. For exmaple the breakage caused by commit fa0f415 should be fixable with some trivial bit flips or similar.",

Switching to that approach does invalidate current cases, but not any worse than adding a case already does, I think; and it seems pretty maintainable to me?\r\n\r\nNote that renumbering cases means that a case that has k iterations through the loop needs each of its k choices to be fuzzed to from the old to the new values to remain equivalent, which isn't a big deal, but I don't think it's entirely trivial? Mostly just seems unnecessarily wasteful to me.",

      "body": "> Like I said, I'm only suggesting avoiding invalidation when it's basically trivial. Don't really want to get bogged down in hypotheticals...\r\n\r\nFair enough. Though, those trivial cases should be rare enough to not yield any benefit given the overhead to having to remember when and how to invalidate them at a later point in time. Except for `script_flags` and `process_messages`, all remaining 150 fuzz targets can reach the current coverage with just minutes of CPU time. (Citation/Benchmark needed)\r\n\r\n> At present, if a PR invalidates ...\r\n\r\nSounds like a good idea. I was thinking about passing -max_total_time to the fuzz engine even when run in ci-mode, but all fuzz targets take a different time, so it would be nicer if there was a -additional_fuzz_time_after_init option. The generated corpus would be lost as soon as the ci box cycles, but that doesn't hurt because the coverage will quickly be re-generated by our fuzz farms once the pull is merged.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is good enough to just set `-max_total_time=30` and thus skip generation if the existing seeds take longer than that to read.",

The non-matching numbers `[12, 32]` will simply be \"ignored\" by the coverage-guided fuzzer.\r\n\r\nThat way we'll only have to invalidate existing seeds when we've exhausted the entire range `[0, 32]` with matching `case`:s. Then we can bump to `[0, 64]`, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn other words: instead of invalidating every time we add a new `case` we'll be invalidating every some-power-of-2:th time we add a new `case` :)",
