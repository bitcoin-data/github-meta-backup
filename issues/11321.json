    "body": "Hello! I'm launching a crypto currency pool. And when it works, bitcoin consumes half of its total processing power. I have a 32-core processor on the server. And I get the impression that bitcoin uses only one or a couple of cores, and does not know how to work with all cores.\r\nHere is the timetable for bitcoin.\r\n![screen shot 2017-09-13 at 19 32 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18491324/30389036-6862cfa6-98ba-11e7-8b72-4c61f05a2993.png)\r\nApparently, in the peak we connected the ASIC. And all this time bitcoin worked only with a couple of cores of my CPU.\r\n",
