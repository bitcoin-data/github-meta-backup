    "title": "Tracking and reporting failures and repeated flakiness of functional tests ",
    "body": "I'm sure anyone who runs the functional tests regularly will experience occasional failures. Often you run those failed tests again and they will pass. Occasionally a functional test will repeatedly fail which is more concerning. It is difficult to assess whether others are experiencing the same flakiness and/or repeated failures and whether it is worth spending time trying to understand and fix the issue. \r\n\r\nIn #25030 @MarcoFalke raised that there are some functional tests that have been flaky for a long time now. \r\n\r\nThis issue is a first attempt to track failures and repeated flakiness contributors experience with particular functional tests. I'm not sure how to organize this. Whether there should be a table of the functional tests that can be regularly updated and edited or whether to just have individual contributors adding comments below on which functional tests they are experiencing failures/flakiness with. \r\n\r\nFor now please comment below if you experience failures/flakiness with a particular functional test and certainly if you spend any time trying to understand why it failed feel free to add thoughts on what you think is causing the problem.\r\n\r\nIdeally this issue would help identify which functional tests to prioritize to fix but we'll see if this is useful or not. If it isn't useful feel free to close.",

If people spot tests failures they should open issues. If other people see the same thing / can provide more info, they can comment on them.

And even if you think that you understand it, some of the failures (e.g. issues with the fee estimation algorithm such as #23165 / #21161 ) are very nontrivial to fix properly.\r\nIt's tempting to go for the easy way of just softening the test assumptions a bit to remove the flakiness and be able to forget about it, but the proper approach of understanding why the test failed (and whether the root cause is in the test code or the code under test) can  be hard - and I think that's the bottleneck, not the tracking.",

(After 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months, 4 months ...)\r\n\r\nIs there a particular reason why the dashboard isn't public? Is it a security concern or just a haven't got round to making it public type thing? I can only speak for myself but when I experience failures/flakiness I have no idea if it is just me or a longstanding issue that everyone else is experiencing. It seems to me that having \"high-frequent ones (that) remain unfixed for months/years\" doesn't appear to be ideal. But I don't know which ones those are.",

Surely people that *fix* the issues are needed more, but if a list attracts those, then why not.\r\n\r\nYou'll have to ask @adamjonas for the dashboard, but doing the task outside the dashboard should be trivial to do as well.\r\n\r\nBasically anything in https://cirrus-ci.com/github/bitcoin/bitcoin/master should not be red (the master branch should not fail tests). There may be a remote network outage when downloading packages, which is unavoidable and the task can be reset (permission might be needed for that). Anything else is likely some kind of bug. For example from today: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25124\r\n\r\nThe same is true for https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls (anything red is a remote network outage or a bug). Though, obviously the bug might have been introduced in the pull. In that case, pinging the author about the bug is also helpful.\r\n\r\nIf the bug is (presumed) in master, reporting it is recommended. A small analysis would be ideal. See for example https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25128\r\n\r\nA reproducer would be even more ideal. See for example https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25129",

If no one is going to try to attempt to fix the issues any list or additional access to a dashboard etc is pointless. Maybe I'm optimistic but there have been a number of new(er) contributors completing [MiniWallet tasks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20078) on the functional tests. I'd have thought fixing other issues with functional tests would be a natural next step for new contributors if they wanted to continue to contribute and it was obvious which issues needed fixing.\r\n\r\n> The simplest solution to that would be searching the open / closed issues. If your issue hasn't been reported, open a new issue. If it has, you could leave a comment.\r\n\r\nKnowing this (opening issues for test failures) is encouraged is useful too. Until now it wasn't clear to me that this was encouraged for flakiness.",
