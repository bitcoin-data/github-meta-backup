    "body": "In a descriptor wallet it returns \"This type of wallet does not support this command\" instead of the private key. Even though the wallet doesn't store the key directly it obviously knows how to build it since it can spend the funds so it should do that and return it. There are just too many cases where a private key needs to be dumped and it shouldn't be a nightmare of RPC calls and 3rd party scripts to try to get it, that just doesn't make sense usability-wise.\r\n\r\nJust a common case point for us for example, we still use p2sh-segwit for our users since too many places still don't support  bech32 and pretty regularly people still send LTC to our BTC addresses (smh, I know) and we need to easily be able to dump the key to recover it for them.",

It sounds like you misunderstand the concern with the parent xpub and child private key - given a parent xpub and a child private key derived with unhardened derivation, the parent xprv can be computed. It is far less obvious that this is the case, and therefore far more dangerous than retrieving the xprv. The xprv is more obviously something that is meant to be kept secret.",

This concern didn't exist with legacy wallets as they were always hardened, but descriptor wallets are by default non-hardened. If your keys are derived in a non-hardened way, all keys should be considered to really be representations of the same secret material, and exporting one is the same as exporting all. And when exporting the private descriptor (which includes the xprv), it's obvious you are exporting everything.\r\n* It's just the wrong direction to move in, as descriptor wallets aren't key-centric anymore (multisig descriptors are first class wallets, and can't support this cleanly).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about alternatively providing an RPC or a tool that can derive and return the private keys involved in a descriptor?",
