All merges of code into the master branch are PGP signed by the maintainer who merges, which is automatically verified. The code itself is mirrorred by developers themselves, and we could easily add other mirrors too. Finally, release binaries are distributed using https://bitcoincore.org, and again use a well-audited system (gitian deterministic builds).\n\nWe mostly use GitHub for its ease of access and community, and not so much for actually managing or controlling or source tree. Unless that changes, I see no reason why the company running it should influence our choice.",

As @sipa says, we already don't use github's merging, but do so with our own script that checks for a clean merge, allows local reviewing, and signs the commit automatically. If a significant part of developers check commit signing before using code, then it's impossible for even github to inject code changes.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't preclude hosting somewhere else, too, though.\r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about not being able to get the code except through Microsoft infrastructure I started a mirror of certain important bitcoin-related repositories on a Tor hidden service: [nxshomzlgqmwfwhcnyvbznyrybh3gotlfgis7wkv7iur2yj2rarlhiad.onion](http://nxshomzlgqmwfwhcnyvbznyrybh3gotlfgis7wkv7iur2yj2rarlhiad.onion/), this can be useful for other reasons too, the sale of GitHub was just my wake-up call to do it.",
