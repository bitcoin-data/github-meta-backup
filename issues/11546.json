Create an offline wallet (on an offline computer)\r\n2. Export offline wallet public keys (addresses)\r\n3. Import offline wallet public keys on an online wallet (other computer) (=> Watch-Only addresses)\r\n4. Fund an address\r\n5. use `createarawtransaction` from online wallet\r\n6. try to sign created transaction on offline computer having offline wallet : error.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nSign the transaction, don't try to check if transaction is funded when offline.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nWon't sign the transaction because don't have access to blockchain offline.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.15.0.1\r\n",
