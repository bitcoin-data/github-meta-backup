    "body": "Hi, I know I'm opening a request that may be rejected outright or may take a long time to discuss and may involve a lot of work.\r\nIt's about the fact that with bitcoin (in general cryptocurrency) we consume a lot of electricity and create CO2 footprint, and for what? For calculating random hashes (as far as I know bitcoin mining has no potential benefit for humanity correct?) and consuming resources for nothing!\r\nI would love to see some kind of merger or adoption of curecoin! So all the computing power we use to mine bitcoin would at least be there for something good and not just use up resources unnecessarily. I ask this because bitcoin has the most computing power of all cryptocurrencies (just in general for science and not just for medicine) and I think it would be a huge advantage for science if we could direct it to do something good with it.\r\nMaybe others will go this way as well.\r\nI think it's an extreme pity how we are exploiting our planet and not even doing anything positive for humanity.\r\njust look at the following page and think about whether we can not at least do something better with these electricity and CO2 values.\r\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/\r\nI hope you think about it and bitcoin does with its computing power in the future something for the whole humanity and not only for those who want to have more money or a safer / more anonymous currency.\r\n\r\nGreetings",
