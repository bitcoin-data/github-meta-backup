    "body": "@sdaftuar Noticed trouble with his builds, and it looks like its due to an unmaintained file in bitcoinj (which is used in pull-testing) \n\nFor accurate build results, I think this should be either updated (the tool*) or deprecated until it is maintained. @theuni do you have any preference ? I ask since it seems you had your hands in the travis yml last, I can look at the bitcoinj side to see what it would take, seems it might just need an update to handle 0.10?\n\nfailing build: https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/61800593\n\npassing build (throws exceptions all over - Ctrl-F \"Exception\" ):https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/61800595 \n\n*tool hasn't seen a commit since december, and likely needs 0.10 updates: https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/bitcoinj/core/BitcoindComparisonTool.java\n\nedit: link to erroneous build command https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/Makefile.am#L195-L197\n",

I didn't notice any references to TheBlueMatt/bitcoinj, but perhaps I'm not looking in the right place.\n\n(As an aside, it also looks like `native_comparisontool.mk` is pointing to an empty ref (404 for me :/): https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/raw/38b490a2599d422b12d5ce8f165792f63fd8f54f , not sure if this is aggravating the buildbot issues or not, though.)\n\nMore to the point, if the builds are breaking, where would the fixes go, and are they valuable to update? (versus pushing that off or expanding @sdaftuar's testing framework, instead -\\* I think having accurate travis builds would provide lots of value)\n",

The full url is download_path + file_name: https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/raw/38b490a2599d422b12d5ce8f165792f63fd8f54f/pull-tests-0f7b5d8.jar\n\nAs for fixing broken builds, the current tool is built from here: https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bitcoinj/commits/0f7b5d89b5f70c0803d36e690b702b5050771381 . That commit doesn't appear in any public branches, it looks like it's been rebased into https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bitcoinj/tree/blocktester. Notice that the package_version in native_comparisontool.mk points to the commit that the jar is built from.\n\nI suggested at one point that we build the jar from source rather than pulling down some random blob, but I was in the minority and I didn't push it. I'd still like to see it work that way, but at this point, it makes more sense to spend the effort get the python tool up to feature parity.\n\nIf you'd like to take a stab at fixing, I suggest you checkout the code at 0f7b5d89b5f70c0803d36e690b702b5050771381, track down the issue, build a jar, then submit a PR to bump the version we pull. But again, I'm sure @sdaftuar could come up with a list of ways you could help out with the python framework instead.\n",

That was a strange moment, thanks for clarifying that.\n\nI also see what you mean about building from source, it seems the jar in `TheBlueMatt/test-scripts` was compiled in a native environment and then distributed using Github, which doesn't feel very good from a deployment perspective. \n\nIt looks like you're spot-on regarding hash-branch correlations too, I see the tip of `TheBlueMatt/blocktester` is the same hash as whats in the tip of `TheBlueMatt/test-scripts` (the jar, at least); and I think my preference is to try to load the BitcoindComparisonTool tests into the python framework as well.\n\nSince it likely means debugging the comparison tool, I'll probably start there, and seeing as how its probably not a light fix I'd like to ask @sdaftuar: What are your thoughts about expanding the python framework a bit to replace the current tooling? It looks like I'll be debugging things in parallel, so I'm curious if you see any benefit from adding to your code.\n",

      "body": "@faizkhan00  I think the next step for the python work is to start recreating the tests from the existing bitcoinj comparison tool in a new python test.  I think there are two main hurdles for this work, one is to just carefully understand the existing tests, and the other is to implement whatever additional python infrastructure might be needed to make for well-written tests (ie that are easy to read, write, update, understand, etc).  Not sure yet exactly what those infrastructure changes will look like, but I'm guessing we'll need to refine the `BlockStore` object (in `blockstore.py`) and maybe the `TestInstance` in `comptool.py`, and likely need to add some additional code to support signing transactions.\n\nI guess a third hurdle is that I think there may be bugs in the existing bitcoinj tests.  For instance one issue I've been meaning to track down but haven't yet is this apparent bug mentioned in an old PR, #2884.\n\nAnyway I am planning to start working on a python reimplementation, but I expect it to take a while before all the tests are rewritten and before everyone would be comfortable cutting over from the existing tests to a new one.  So if you do spend time debugging/patching the bitcoinj version, which actually also needs to be patched for #5966, that should be generally helpful I think.\n\nAlso if you're interested in diving in and writing python tests please feel free, though unfortunately I haven't written up documentation yet to explain how the code is structured and how to write new tests (it's on my list of things to do once the interface feels more settled, probably after the next round of changes) -- for now I'd suggest looking at the tests added in #5981 for examples to follow and reading the comments in the code.  And feel free to ping me with any specific questions in the meantime.\n",

If along the way the documentation for the python code ends up getting written, I might switchover, but I think in either case it will be good to figure out what the Java tool does so we can port that code to Python eventually.
