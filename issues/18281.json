Please read the entire discussion to get all the nuances and gotchas (there are quite a few of them!) :)\r\n\r\nThe comments in the related PR is #18147 further highlights the confusion regarding what we assume to hold true with regards to locales in the project.\r\n\r\nNote that in `bitcoin-qt` the C locale (`setlocale`) is reflecting `LC_*`, but the C++ locale (`std::locale::global`) is not.\r\n\r\nIf we consider `ScriptToAsmStr`, `i64tostr` and `itostr` to be safe as written now that implies that we assume that the C++ locale never being set to anything but `C` (the classic locale).\r\n\r\nIf we assume the C++ locale to always be `C` then we should state that explicitly and also assert it as runtime as suggested in #18124.\r\n\r\nThe current non-principled \"whack-a-mole\" approach to locale handling seems fragile at best :)",
