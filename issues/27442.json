    "title": "Add parallelism for downloading the blockchain",
    "body": "Please add parallelism (at least, multithreading; multithreading + some kind of clustering are better) for downloading blockchain by client/wallet (required by `getblocktemplate`).\r\n**The speed of downloading the blockchain of Bitcoin is very slow, so much time is required, it's absolutely awful. And the further, the worse.**\r\nAs I can understand, it happens because of nature of blockchain processing: first, client must check block N contents (transactions), then it can proceed to check of block N+1.\r\nBut we can behave like modern CPUs branch predictors. Why not? Just pretend block N is correct for thread M and let thread M+1 check block N+1. Then let thread M+1 pass necessary information to thread M+2 for checking block N+2. And so on. So all threads can check it's blocks, doing CPUs utilization. Threads can be reused as they become free. Just break processing at some points and do rollback, if some previous blocks (N, N+1, ...) gets corrupted.\r\nAs far I can see by CPUs usage, Bitcoin Core/Wallet does not behave like that. My Internet connection is not such slow and unstable; I once experimented with connection limit options, it didn't work for me.\r\nThe behavior I suggest has some performance risk, so it can be explicitly controlled by the user with launch option[s] (command line, ...).\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>A little spoiler ;)</summary>\r\nIt wouldn't be a problem at all, if the user could just download the blockchain (full or pruned) from some popular (so popular to be found) websites he trust.\r\n\r\n(I aware about the security considerations, but this is not a issue if the user just wants to try mining or something.)\r\n</details>",

      "body": "There are already two types of parallel processing involved in the initial block download mechanism:\n* Blocks are downloaded from multiple peers in parallel, fetching one up to a few blocks per peer at a time, from a moving window of the next 1024 blocks.\n* Script validation of blocks is performed in parallel on multiple CPU cores (splitting the work for any one single block). This only has an effect during the final blocks in the chain after the assumevalid point, because before, no script validation takes place at all.\n\nGoing beyond these would require very invasive changes to the protocol, as it's not possible to validate the inputs of block N+1 without having the outputs of block N, as validation depends on the outputs being spent.\n\nIn practice, initial download speed is primarily limited by the cost of maintaining the UTXO set database, not downloading and validation itself. To speed things up, your best bet is increasing the database cache size.\n\nAs @pinheadmz says, for more information on how things work, https://bitcoin.stackexchabge.com is a better resource than the bug tracker.",

OK then, I will try this on next full synching, if you insist. _Does this work with **prune** blockchain synching?_\r\nI can't find how to download from multiple peers on request `headers first sync`. Can you tell a launch option, please?\r\nAnd, of course, it would be nice to find such an option in the output of `bitcoind --help`.\r\n\r\n@sipa\r\nI see...\r\n\r\nThanks for the info both of you.",
