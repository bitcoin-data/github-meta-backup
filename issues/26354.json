    "body": "When trying to make a guix build with a more recent Guix master branch commit, I encounter a somewhat cryptic exception. I'm able to build all the other hosts. Tried with v24.0rc2 (plus a patch to bump the time machine) as well as recent master. I tried with Guix commit 39dcbc7fa3c02ff5c9682f25e1c29667dbfe7827 (the oldest I'm able to build without substitutes) and the most recent 00ff6f7c399670a76efffb91276dea2633cc130c. I also reproduced the issue on my older Guix machine, which I've used to sign the rc2 before.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26351#issuecomment-1285742288 for error log. Not sure how to make it more verbose.",
