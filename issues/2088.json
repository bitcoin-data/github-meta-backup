    "body": "0.6.x aea0658578a64503967856c235d7ca1a361e1c3b\n\nWhen proxy=127.0.0.1:7053 dns seed is performed.\nWhen proxy=192.168.0.1:9050 dns seed is not performed.\n\n1)\nAccording to '-h', dnsseed should always be used if dnsseed is 1 or unspecified. And not used if 0.\n\nThis difference in dnsseed / ThreadDNSAddressSeed based on the proxy value is bad. It should always follow dnsseed setting/default.\n\n2)\nAnd when the former setting is used, the dns seed does not go through the proxy as directed. This leak is bad. If proxy is specified, all traffic needs to go through the proxy.\n\n2a)\nAlso, suggest using primarily socks5, secondary socks4a, tertiary socks4.\nAlso socks4 and socks4a cannot do IPv6!\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928\n\nEdit:\nIf still the case, do not assume use of proxy port 9050 is Tor, and that use of any other proxy port is not Tor.\nI should test with v0.7.x.\nbitcoin_stable repo is missing some recent release tags.\n",
