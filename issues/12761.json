    "title": "Separate RPC documentation from code",
    "body": "I think RPC documentation should be separated from the C++ code itself.\r\n\r\nIt makes building more tools based on it needlessly [complicated](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org/pull/526), and it also pads the RPC code too much.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking how to separate the RPC docs strings from the code itself. My 3 ideas\r\n\r\n* make some preprocessor macros and the documentation will be copied to the source code by the C++ pre-processor - that could be a good solution, but maybe hard to decypher?\r\n* keep the docs at separate files (in plaintext/possibly even markup) and let bitcoind read them at runtime - that could create annoying dependencies and probably introduce parsing errors?\r\n* keep the docs at separate files (in plaintext/markup) and \"transpile\" them somehow to the C++ code at make step\r\n\r\nDo you think it's a good idea? And which of the three possible ways is best?",

It makes the RPC code actually understandable (how else are you supposed to know what `request.params[3]` means?) and makes it less likely that documentation will become out of date when the code changes.\r\n\r\nAlso, I could be missing something, but  all of the suggestions above seem more complicated than the current help implementation, not simpler. I'd expect it would simplify tooling to structure the documentation, so it wouldn't be necessary to parse the big strings, instead of just moving the strings from one file to another.",
