    "body": "Some users who run a node on their PC (used for gaming, email, adult activities, etc.) would surely like to set the _bitcoin-qt_ priority for their node to \"low\" on Windows, or \"niceness 19\" on a Linux machine.\r\nOn the other hand, a person running a server would potentially want to run the daemon at the highest priority possible. It would be nice to have the option to automate this for us.\r\n\r\nSomething similar was debated in issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3618 and I am aware that there's the number of script validation threads setting (might be useful to further explain in the GUI that that's basically CPU core count). However, adjusting the process priority is another thing.\r\n\r\nI like _ghost_'s idea of `--pri=`, although to be honest I'd like `--priority=` even more - with at least three options (low, normal, high). \"Above normal\" and \"Below normal\", like described in Windows, might be a good idea as well.\r\n\r\nIf my computer restarts, I don't want to manually change the process priority every time it happens, or write a script - I'd like to input my preferences into the config file or click it in the GUI options. I'm sure many other users would like that as well.\r\n",

      "body": "Personally, I'm not sure this is within the scope of this project. There are many system-level knobs (if you think of the modern stack as `kernel < system < userspace`) that we can fiddle with, and it is unfortunate that there aren't many system-level management software out there that allows for easy-fiddling (only `systemd` tries to do this). However, in this respect I believe that users are much better off writing a wrapper that sets niceness and ioniceness values.\r\n\r\nWhat I think _**might**_ be useful is writing documentation on how to fiddle with knobs, or even just a document linking to manuals where the fiddling is described.",
