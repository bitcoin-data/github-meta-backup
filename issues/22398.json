    "title": "Should Bitcoin Core quit when something goes wrong?",
    "body": "(Moved from https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/364)\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core quits without any error message being shown. The application just disappears from the taskbar. I realize that things can go wrong (and I would very much figure out what goes wrong for me specifically), but should the application quit rather than gracefully show an error message and prompt the user to do something (for example check the error log or restart the software)? That is, is this type of behavior a bug or a feature? I definitely think that it shouldn't work this way.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core should still be open, possibly with some error message showing that it has stopped running with some suggestions what the user can do.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nProgram quits and disappears from the taskbar.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nI guess this depends on your system, but for me, I simply import my old wallet into the wallet folder, start Bitcoin Core and then wait. When searching for this error online, I see that it has been an issue more or less from the start.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nI run version 0.21.1, 64-bit, of Bitcoin Core, downloaded as an installer from Bitcoin.org. I'm using Windows version 10.0.19042.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/364#issuecomment-861465896:\r\n> I did try to run bitcoind instead. At first, it worked, but after trying to load my wallet via the cli, it just shut down (again, non gracefully; it just disappeared), and the cli gave me an error message saying that the daemon needed to run. Ever since that happening, running bitcoind just results in it closing itself after a while. The last thing I manage to see in the window, which I don't think should close itself, is \"Rescan started from block something, something....\". No extra log messages are written to either debug.log or db.log.",
