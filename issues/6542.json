    "title": "Bitcoin Truck Factor",
    "body": "As part of my PhD research on code authorship, we calculated the Truck Factor (TF) of some popular GitHub repositories.\n\nAs you probably know, the [Truck (or Bus) Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) designates the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. In our work, we consider that a system is in trouble if more than 50% of its files become orphan (i.e., without a main author).\n\nMore details on our work in this preprint: https://peerj.com/preprints/1233\n\nWe calculated the TF for **Bitcoin** and obtained a value of **3**.\n\nThe developers responsible for this TF are:\n\nWladimir J. van der Laan - author of 27% of the files\nMike Hearn - author of 21% of the files\nPieter Wuille - author of 20% of the files\n\nTo validate our results, we would like to ask **Bitcoin** developers the following three brief questions:\n\n(a) Do you agree that the listed developers are the main developers of **Bitcoin**?\n\n(b) Do you agree that **Bitcoin** will be in trouble if the listed developers leave the project (e.g., if they win in the lottery, to be less morbid)?\n\n(c) Does **Bitcoin** have some characteristics that would attenuate the loss of the listed developers (e.g., detailed documentation)?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGuilherme Avelino\nPhD Student\nApplied Software Engineering Group (ASERG)\nUFMG, Brazil\nhttp://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/\n",

      "body": "No. I do not agree, alas.\n\n(a) For example, Mike Hearn has made only a couple of small contributions.  One of those contributions was importing a third party repository into the code base (the leveldb subtree) which I presume is what is distorting your results.\n\nOther projects also import large amounts of outside code, and you should take care to avoid misattributing in those cases. (In addition to leveldb, bitcoin also embedds other codebases such as libsecp256k1).\n\nPieter and Wladimir are substantial contributors. However:  From your text it sounds like you're counting who created files, for many projects including Bitcoin most files are created not as a result of authorship but as a result of moving code around, and so if you are measuring creation this may not be a useful metric. (In our case the most important authors also move code around, but in other projects the metric may be worse).\n\n(b) I don't know.  We may find out..\n\n(c) The project has successfully cycled out contributors during its lifetime already. So we do have an existence proof to some extent.\n",

It totally excludes the influence why a line of code was written as well as reviews (take gmaxwells influence as example). Also it – very likely – won't detect any copy'n'pasted line of code from a different project or source (like we face here with mikes leveldb integration work).\n\nI agree that a disappearing of Pieter oder Wladimir would be hard to recover from.\n\nAll these source-code contributor-importance measurements over algorithms will probably fail. IMO only humans can judge a contributors value.\nWhy: \n1) the fact that you can change one byte in the binary (example: a 7A to a 7B, JP to JPE X86) or one byte in the source that change the whole behavior of the application. Very hard to evaluate quality of such changes by a software.\n2) Take the GUI as example. Bitcoin-core's GUI part is relatively large. Is it essentially for bitcoin-core? Probably no. Meanwhile a commit which would change the blocksize limit (sorry, bad example) could decide if a project survives or dies within the next years.\n",
