    "title": "Use C++ language binding for ZMQ",
    "body": "ZMQ has a [native language binding for C++](http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-cpp), which among other things takes advantage of RAII for the context, sockets and messages.\r\n\r\nIs there any particular reason why Bitcoin Core's ZMQ interface does not use the C++ language bindings?  That would most likely simplify the code a lot and make it more robust against subtle bugs.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that the `doc/zmq.md` file explicitly says that \"the C++ language bindings are not necessary\" - however, at least on my Debian system, it seems that the default ZMQ package `libzmq3-dev` already includes the C++ language bindings; so it is not really a separate dependency.",

      "body": "@jmcorgan:  The main point where I think the C++ wrapper improves readability and robustness is through type-safety and RAII.  Instead of passing around `void*` for the ZMQ context and socket, you have a typed object (e.g. `zmq::socket_t`).  And instead of manually calling an initialiser and a destructor for it, this is done by the language - including a guarantee that the destructor is called, which might be forgotten when using the pure C API (especially with things like multiple returns in a function or exceptions).\r\n\r\nIf there is no longer a big reason not to depend on the C++ wrapper, then I can simply prepare a PR that changes to it and then we can judge based on that how much it simplifies the code (or not).",
