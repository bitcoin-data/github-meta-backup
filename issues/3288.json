    "title": "bitcoind \"sendtoaddress\" spending unconfirmed outputs",
    "body": "The Bitcoind daemon is spending unconfirmed outputs as inputs in new transactions. This is leading to dependency chains that could be susceptible to double spends. \n\nSome examples of this behavior: \n\nThis transaction https://blockchain.info/tx/35c4e8c86075cf3f5335e029abd2d981af011c142b56e04c0a6d8b0d588d32ae which included a fee spent the unconfirmed output transaction https://blockchain.info/tx/99e6c22980571d1733986d950f564854393777ba0905d08aae36d7f4f64e4a3a which included no fee. \n\nNote that in both cases, the _only_ command executed against the Bitcoin Daemon (0.8.5) was \"sendtoaddress\". Also note that https://blockchain.info/tx/35c4e8c86075cf3f5335e029abd2d981af011c142b56e04c0a6d8b0d588d32ae had to have its raw tx manually pushed using blockchain.info/pushtx functionality in order to appear. This is what led to the discovery that unconfirmed outputs were being spent.\n\nThis issue appears to have become noticeable because of the increased user traffic on the Bitcoin network leading to more transactions with no fees. As a consequence, miners are cherry picking transactions with fees leading to backlogs and dependency chains becoming evident. There are numerous issues in the bitcointalk.org [Technical Support] sub-board as well as topics such as: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=339792.0 on the problem.  \n",

In effect, your transaction chain is bottle necked by any preceding transaction used as an input that is not favored for inclusion in a block. \n\nIn the two examples cited in the above thread, downstream transactions included a fee but were not confirmed in a timely manner because they filed a dependency on an 0 fee ancestor that was ignored by miners until its priority mandated its inclusion. By providing a minconf parameter, you avoid the situation where unconfirmed outputs are spent, and therefore ensure that the addition of a fee is actually meaningful in the context of the current transaction.\n",
