    "body": "#16003 has been closed, and I've pulled out the unrelated p2p change. However I think it's worth someone following up and taking a look at our startup file descriptor accounting. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned in #16003, if `bitcoind` is started somewhere that the maximum number of open file descriptors is limited, we can run into some nonsensical behaviour. Such as a \"negative\" number of maximum connections:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# using bash\r\nulimit -n 150\r\nsrc/bitcoind\r\n[init] Using at most -8 automatic connections (150 file descriptors available)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also impossible to shutdown `bitcoind` from this state as the `opencon` thread will never exit.\r\n\r\nIt would be good for someone to look through this code, document assumptions, and fix issues like the above.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks @MrSquanchee!\r\n\r\nI've added most of my thoughts on this in the closed issue above. As of now, the FD counts are pretty much hardcoded in, and I think it would be nice to get away from that in a modular way if we want things like a configurable number of inbound/outbound/feeler connections, lots of RPC threads, FDs used by future changes that will have possibly missed modifying the initial FD count, etc. \r\n\r\nThere's also the concept of \"soft limits\" of FDs, which is currently implemented in a way that reduces the possible maximum of 125 inbound connections when we allocate them to *some* other stuff, but I think this \"soft limit\" should be applied to the maximum number of FDs available to the process. This would be nice, as most Linux distros give you 1024 FDs, which would allow for much more varied configurations and eliminate the need to reduce the 125 inbound count.\r\n\r\nThere's also an assumption that every system will use the same count, which I'm not sure will be true in the future, or is true now (I didn't really have a large enough test bed of OSes when I opened the issue, which was kind of discouraging). Something that actually measures the number of FDs open by the process might also be helpful, instead of assuming we've measured correctly.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, something that tells us the number of required, requested, and allocated FDs on startup would be informative. Similar to what I had in the closed issue, which is what causes the bug above (the allocated number of FDs returned gets reduced lower than the required number of FDs). So if we don't get our requested amount, we can *possibly* revamp our counts in such a way that we still meet the required amount. \r\n\r\nOn another note: arbitrarily changing FD counts to critical things is not a solution in my mind, but in support of more robust configs, there's at least some bigger nodes that need to vary these counts, and probably a sane minimum we can use for most stuff (current values could be a sane minimum and default maximum for some things, ie. feeler connections).",

      "body": "> If anyone is looking for somewhere to get started, I've cleaned up the file descriptor code in `init.cpp` a little [here](https://github.com/troygiorshev/bitcoin/commit/d9e1c1e83afc29782e26c1ae020539dc15444f75).\r\n\r\nI've also taken the liberty to meddle with this: here's a [branch](https://github.com/NelsonFrancisco/bitcoin/compare/master...NelsonFrancisco:n2021-31-03-fd)\r\n\r\nMade a branch with a \"sanitizing\" of this code before trying to achieve the issue here. I found the \"nMaxConnections\" variable value to be really hard to track, so I've thrown an error, if -maxconnections is less than 0, and used a temporary variable before finally defining nMaxConnections. So, I believe I changed no behavior besides the error throwing.\r\n\r\nI believe also, that \"AppInitParameterInteraction\" should be divided into several functions. It simply does too much, IMO. Maybe in a separated commit, what do you think?\r\n\r\nSo, for the problem in itself: is it possible for the nMaxConnections variable to get a negative value? What's the best approach to solve this? Change the following calculation `nFD - MIN_CORE_FILEDESCRIPTORS - MAX_ADDNODE_CONNECTIONS - NUM_FDS_MESSAGE_CAPTURE` ?",
