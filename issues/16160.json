    "body": "After updating to 0.18.0 we've started experiencing issues where TXes to random addresses in our wallet aren't showing up in listsinceblock/listtransactions. Trying to narrow down when I do a getaddressinfo on them I saw ischange = true and that seems to be the issue is some of the addresses have been marked as change somehow; note these were made with getnewaddress and/or addwitnessaddress so are not change addresses. Doing a \"setlabel address ''\" removes the flag and fixes it but we can't go through millions of addresses with getaddressinfo :)",

You shouldn't be receiving incoming payments as transactions with change outputs. We may want to improve how to deal with this situation (as I agree not listing them at all is bad), but there is only so much that can be done.\r\n\r\nThe second, depending on how you got in this situation, worries me a lot more.

Create a new address A and generate 101 blocks with sending a reward to the created address A\r\n3. Create a wallet backup\r\n4. Create new address B\r\n5. Send transaction to address B, write TXID\r\n6. Generate 1 block with sending a reward to address A\r\n7. View getaddressinfo B. Verify labels are not an empty list\r\n8. View listtransactions. Make sure there is a TXID transaction present\r\n9. Stop bitcoin core\r\n10. Restore backup\r\n11. Run bitcoin core\r\n12. View getaddressinfo B and listtransactions. Detect that the address does not have a label set and that listtransactions does not contain a TXID transaction.",
