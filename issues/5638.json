    "body": "I discovered a race condition in sendrawtransaction. For details: see my comment in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/1d46fe3327f6645fd79b442cd72ef422418c1a50.\n\nIf you send a raw transaction which has already been broadcasted, then you don't know whether you'll receive an RPC_TRANSACTION_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN exception, since you don't know whether a new block has just been received, which includes the transaction. There are use cases where such RPC_TRANSACTION_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN occurrences do not indicate an error; however, since this type of occurrence is very rare, developers are not likely to be aware of the possibility, and silence the exception. As a result, applications can potentially experience hard-to-diagnose, very rare errors.\n\nI think the core of the problem is that sendrawtransaction tries to combine two use cases:\nA: publish a transaction on the Bitcoin network\nB: re-transmit an already known transaction to peers\nRPC_TRANSACTION_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN might make sense for B, but for A (which is, IMHO, the primary use case) it is confusing.\n",

      "body": "Yes, while working on 1d46fe3 I thought about removing the RPC_TRANSACTION_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN exception, and just returning success in case the transaction is already in the chain. After all, it is successful if it is already in.\n\nEventually I didn't do that, to keep some compatibility with the old behavior. It's reasonably useful in some cases to know when a transaction already landed in the chain, and if not you can ignore the specific error code.\n\n(I would argue it's misuse of an exception and returning a {'inchain':X, 'inmempool':X, 'txhash':X} structure would be more informative, but alas, that'd mean changing the interface to be even more incompatible)\n",
