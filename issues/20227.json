    "body": "After reading [this post](https://unixsheikh.com/articles/important-open-source-projects-should-not-use-github.html) with the title «Important Open Source projects should not use GitHub» I thought instantly about Bitcoin and it's source code. It is the most important open source project and it is hosted on GitHub.\r\n\r\nWas this topic ever discussed? I would think so after Microsoft aquired GitHub, but I couldn't find it. What happens if GitHub requires a Microsoft account to login to GitHub, are all developers willing to create a Microsoft account?\r\n\r\nI know, I don't offer a solution at this point. I heard about [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/) as an Alternative to GitHub. The problem is, the source code of Bitcoin will (with the current available git hosting providers) always be centralized. Is that the reason why Bitcoin didn't move away from GitHub?\r\n\r\nThis is more like a discussion, if this is the wrong place for that or there is already an open issue. Please close this one and point me in the right direction. Thanks!\r\n",

I also regularly fetch all pulls/issues html (which is nowadays incomplete with the lazy loading approach of comments and reviews).\r\n\r\nMaybe we should reinvestigate in mirroring \"everything\". Weekly fetching of all issues/pulls including all comments, etc. by the JSON API.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are viable GitHub alternatives (like GitLab) which probably makes it harder for Microsoft to add things like \"everyone needs a Microsoft account\".

I can look up all the issues that were deleted, if needed.\"\r\n\r\n**Thoughts on experimenting with a GitHub alternative**\r\n\r\n\"iirc the idea was to move away from any centralised service, if a migration were to happen\"\r\n\r\n\" I guess we could have moved the gui monotree to GitLab for comparison. Downside would be that all gui ppl need to create another account for review/pulls \"\r\n\r\n\"If we need to move, i'd suggest moving everything, having split environments is even more annoying\"\r\n\r\n**Thoughts on GitLab specifically**\r\n\r\n\"Gitlab seems to handle things fine, e.g. freedesktop uses their own gitlab instance to host some active high-profile projects such as Mesa, no big issues from what i know. They were also really, really careful to transition from mailinglist-based FOSS development, they never trusted GitHub\"\r\n\r\n\"the globocorps and startup missions i was on until late 2018 used gitlab and mattermost instead of github and slack, which i was happy about, and we didn't have any issues at all -- i definitely preferred gitlab\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a GitLab repo that exceeded an arbitrary repo size limit years ago; opened an issue on their tracker, no response; pokes on Twitter, was told they'd look at it, still no response.. years later\"\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@TheBlueMatt on IRC:\r\n\r\n> gitlab seems pretty complicated, right?\r\n\r\nhmm? you mean to self-host it? I didnt look into it too deeply. I think actually the easiest thing to set up would be to a) create a webform that lets you upload an ssh pubkey which then creates a user which is restricted to git-shell, b) restirct each user via GIT_NAMESPACE to a subtree of refs which is prefixed by their ssh pubkey hash or so, c) use gitweb to display all the pushes people have, d) limit upload pack size and do something to limit how many pushes/hour each remote IP can do. I think the above basically lets you do an anonymous git project management with an hour or two of setup and without all the complication of something like gitlab or gitea where users have ot actually create accounts with emails and passwords and stuff.\r\n\r\n> iirc actually restricting users to git-shell with ssh isn't as trivial as it should be\r\n\r\nno, you just set their login shell, its one command or you can just edit /etc/passwd's shell entry and done. you also have to create an empty git-shell-commands file or something stupid but thats easy.\r\n\r\n> github i think is using a custom ssh daemon\r\n\r\nah, i could see that. i mean ssh is shit, but i dont think git-shell is the biggest of your worries in that case. and if you're worried just do a separate git-upload server and then pull from it every minute on the actual git server. but I think you have the same issue with gitlab or whatever. the other thing I was thinking about is doing git pushes via https, and then just setting a cookie for user auth. still anonymous, but users have to configure a per-repo cookieFile and set the flag to let the server set cookies locally. would be a tiny bit more work for users, but the server-side setup would be similar effort. just via nginx authentication modules instead of ssh. if you're feeling un-lazy, you can set it up for git.bitcoin.ninja and then I'll just let people use that server for stuff :)\r\n\r\n",

However, currently it appears that the consensus opinion from regular contributors is that the project is not in need of any such sysadmin help for migrating off GitHub. (That might change in the future of course.)\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a sysadmin task that I think is somewhat urgently needed by the project: we need a Bitcoin Core installation of ClusterFuzz/CIFuzz to catch issues such as the recent wtxid crash bug before merge (or at least soon after merge). See comment in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20332#issuecomment-724893664 for more information. Sysadmin volunteers welcome!",

Multiple regular contributors have concern about the current state of GitHub performance and the future trajectory. If they didn't I wouldn't bother engaging with this topic (whatever my personal views).\r\n\r\nI am interested in what it would need to migrate and whether this is possible/viable. It certainly sounds like you think it isn't viable which is interesting. Other long term contributors did not think it would be that disruptive when I chatted to them on IRC.
