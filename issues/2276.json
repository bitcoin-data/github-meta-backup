It only counts unconfirmed coins from others, not change from myself.  The \"overview\" tab in the Qt client makes the same mistake as the RPC getbalance call.\n\nSo it looks like I have large amounts of confirmed coins, and can afford to make a payment with confirmed coins only when in fact I can't.\n\nIf I want to wait until I have enough confirmed coins in my wallet make a payment with inputs that are in the blockchain already, I have no way of knowing how long to wait, because the wallet lies to me about my unconfirmed balance (unless I use 'bitcoind listunspent 1' and sum up the amounts myself, which is the workaround I ended up using).\n",
