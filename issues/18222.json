    "title": "Add `blockfilterindex = p2wpkh` ",
    "body": "I would like to have a `p2wpkh` `blockfilterindex` type to outsource Wasabi's filter generation to Bitcoin Core, as our filter generation is orders of magnitude slower and we would like to bring this to the client side too, so our users with full nodes would be able to validate that our server does not cheat.  \r\n\r\nI previously created a `blockfilterindex` extensibility proposal to enable filter type combinations: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18221. So the followup PR of this issue will make sure it adheres to it. Since the PR is ready already, I'll omit to go into the implementation details in this issue, rather concentrate on the goal, the benefits of end users and how we ruled out the alternative solutions.\r\n\r\n### The Goal\r\n\r\nWe would like to enable our users to upgrade Wasabi to be a full node with one click.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9156103/75548208-01e47900-5a2d-11ea-9f5a-87b7d6099a47.png)\r\n\r\nThis feature is already implemented and rolled out to production (shipping with Core, fee estimation, tx broadcasting, mempool serving etc..) except the (most important) validation part of it is yet to be added.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Solutions\r\n\r\nI've been long struggling with how to enable this for our users and we ended up working together with a brilliant dev, @dangershony, who maintained the C# Bitcoin full node for years. Unfortunately we had to rule out all the possible alternatives.  \r\n\r\nOne alternative would be using `importmulti`, but we would not like to rely on the wallet feature of Bitcoin Core, rather stick to the node functionality.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be to slowly replace our filters with Bitcoin Core's filters on the client side, but that would require reindexing all of our wallets, which in some cases could take half a day. Also mixing filter types feels dirty and can result in unexpected issues.\r\n\r\nWe also considered bringing our own filter generation algorithm to the client side, but this is one of the oldest brain class of our codebase that serves a critical functionality so touching this could be problematic. It currently takes 2-3 days for us to create our filters on a powerful server, even though we are using `p2wpkh` filters and only building them from segwit activation. Bitcoin Core creates these filters within 2 hours. Why we are so slow is out of the scope of this issue, but here's the clue: input scripts aren't part of a transaction.\r\n\r\nFurther we considered just blindly going through all the blocks and process all the transactions and make sure the server doesn't lie. The performance here is also unacceptable.\r\n\r\nFinally we would also don't like to use bloom filters, as it is on the edge of obsolation and having multiple filters to achieve the same purpose feels dirty from a complexity point of view.\r\n\r\n### Benefits to the End User\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell has suggested to articulate the benefits to the end user for changes to the codebase, thus this section.\r\n\r\nAdding new filter types and filter type combinations (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18221) would enable a privacy oriented light wallet surge to be built on top of Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nMaybe more importantly Bitcoin Core providing the filters to Wasabi enables a clean architecture and a seamless UX for users willing to run a full node that comes with Wasabi.\r\n\r\nIt is quite unique in a sense that no other popular light wallets went to the extent of building a full node into their software, especially not in a way that only requires a a single click configuration, so if our feature gets out of \"work in progress\" phase there may be an influx of full node users, which is good for the network.\r\n\r\nWhat we stand to lose is that this full node feature will be delayed into the future so far that I may not be here when the next clean solution presents itself and maybe the Wasabi team won't be willing to work on it as frankly it has little business value.\r\n\r\n### What's Next?\r\n\r\nThis issue described our motivation and the context of the feature request, our pull request is coming up soon, so we discuss the specifics.",

Your suggestion seems to be the one where Wasabi serves its own filters to the users and users with full nodes are slowly replacing Wasabi filters with Core filters and as Core filters take over it would work with that instead of Wasabi filters. Sorry, I wasn't clear about the hybrid nature of our full node mode implementation. Wasabi is a light wallet until the full node catches up.\r\n\r\nI described this scenario in my post, so let me quote myself:\r\n\r\n> Another alternative could be to slowly replace our filters with Bitcoin Core's filters on the client side, but that would require reindexing all of our wallets, which in some cases could take half a day. Also mixing filter types feels dirty and can result in unexpected issues.",

I'm not sure I understand.\r\n\r\nBIP 157 explains how the filters can be fetched over a P2P connection. Currently, BIP 157 uses one byte to uniquely identify the filter type. The bits in the byte are currently not interpreted separately. Also, to make it possible for wallets that depend on the BIP 158 filter type, nodes supporting it will set a service bit.\r\n\r\nSince there are already nodes running BIP 157+158, it is not trivial to just add a new filter type to the existing BIPs. It might be required to write a new BIP for the new filter type and signal it on a new service bit.\r\n\r\nHowever, introducing a bunch of new filter types (e.g. each script type for each segwit version) needs to be weighted against the downsides (cost of service bit, cost on full nodes to create the index).\r\n\r\nAgain, it would be useful to know why the existing BIP 158 filters (that work on the raw scriptPubKey, thus work for any segwit version and script type) are not sufficient for Wasabi's use case.",

In that case I'm fine with adding `p2wphk`, though I agree with @MarcoFalke that it doesn't seem very useful at first glance, especially without pruning.\r\n\r\nBitcoin DNS seeds announce which services are supported by nodes, and they allow querying for specific features, e.g. only nodes that serve block filters: https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder/pull/77/files (try `dig -t A x49.seed.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl`).\r\n\r\nIf there's plethora of different block filters out there, then either nodes have to play a trial and error game based on everything returned by `x49`, or we have to introduce additional P2P flags, that the DNS seeds can then filter. Either way doesn't really scale to more than a small number of filters. That's in additional to the privacy drawback, because which block filter(s) a wallet asks or a node offers tells something.\r\n\r\nBeing able to combine filters doesn't solve the above problems, though tailer made filters may be useful for a local wallet talking to a local node. Under the hood and at the RPC level we could have more fine grained filters like you suggest in #18221, but at the p2p level I suggest serving a very limited set.",

      "body": "@MarcoFalke Thanks for bringing up the filter from wallet creation idea. We did not consider it this time. Back then this is how I implemented Hidden Wallet (predecessor of Wasabi) but in Wasabi I dropped the concept because others were bringing up privacy concerns. I personally don't think there are any leaks that wouldn't be just nitpicking, yet I dropped the concept in Wasabi with the thinking P2PWPKH filters from SegWit activation will just be fine to create a light wallet feeling and hopefully the filters' size will grow slower than the tech improves and if not then we implement it.  \r\nAt this point I don't feel like implementing it again as long as there is a chance for having a new filter type, but if it is rejected, that could be a way forward.\r\n\r\n@Sjors to answer for your very first question. The `P2WPKH` vs `P2WPKH+P2WSH` filter sizes are `249MB` vs `251MB`.\r\n\r\n@schildbach that'd be awesome if there'd be a mobile wallet that uses client side filters. Finally a mobile wallet I could recommend for privacy!\r\n\r\n@dangershony It seems to be there's a consensus here that `P2WPKH+P2WSH` filters is preferable over `P2WPKH` filters, would you mind updating your PR?",

      "body": "Given that the `basic` type has a BIP ([158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki)) this one should as well. I suggest proposing a service bit for it, but see how that discussion goes. Perhaps it's overkill to have a service bit for a filter that, with increasing SegWit adoption over time, only offers a short term benefit. But if the filter is only used locally by a wallet, then it's not worth a BIP. Maybe the service bit can have a sunset block.\r\n\r\nYou should post the v0 filter BIP on the list as a separate thread from the filter combinations discussion, even though of course they are interlinked because of the service bit.\r\n\r\nIn your PR you use the same `M = 784931, P = 19` params as the basic filter. BIP158 says:\r\n\r\n> Empirical analysis also shows that was chosen as these parameters minimize the bandwidth utilized, considering both the expected number of blocks downloaded due to false positives and the size of the filters themselves\r\n\r\nBut it sadly doesn't link to said analysis. That's food some some mailinglist discussion. The right numbers might depend on SegWit adoption, but we can't predict that, so may it's not a factor. But SegWit v0 transactions also have different typical input and output sizes; I don't know if that matters.",

If e.g. 90% of txns were native SegWit, it should not matter much wether you're using the `basic` filter (which covers everything) or \"just\" the `P2WPKH` filter (which I assume would then only be ~10% smaller).\r\n\r\nIf I'm right with the above, I would suggest to consider specialized filters only as temporary and _not_ allocate any scarce resources (technical debt?) to it.",
