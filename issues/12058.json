    "body": "It often takes more than half an hour to catch up on less than a day of blocks. I suspect the bottleneck is disk I/O because I don't have an SSD Drive.  Here's a recent [log](https://gist.github.com/Sjors/b72dbc71c1a3d1a8627adc60518ddd72).\r\n\r\nIt's a Fusion drive, which means some part of it is SSD, but it's up to the OS where to put stuff. Maybe there's some way to give MacOS a hint which files to be on the SSD part? (Or maybe it eventually figures this out).\r\n\r\nI'm not using `txindex`.\r\n\r\nI've noticed things tends to speed up a bit as the used dbcache grows.\r\n\r\n@sipa wrote in #10647:\r\n> The database is stored in a special compact format on disk. When loaded into memory it's done an quickly-accessible way that is several times larger than the disk version. Loading the whole thing in memory needs around 8 GB.\r\n\r\n> There could perhaps be an option to load the whole database into memory at startup to speed things up later if you actually have that much dbcache configured....\r\n\r\nIs there an experimental branch for this? Depending on the level of rocket science required, I might take a stab at it myself.\r\n\r\nI'm buying an external SSD drive, so will be able to compare. Although apparently that might still not perform nearly as well as an internal SSD drive. Though again, loading a whole bunch of date in one operation might help there as well.",

Currently, we just load spent/created UTXOs in RAM, until the cache is full, and then write the whole thing (all modified UTXO entries) to disk, and wipe it, and start over.\n\nYou might think that there's a benefit in keeping some non-dirty recently created UTXOs around, but benchmarks show that this is actually not beneficial, as it reduces the number of updates that can be done before the cache is full again, leading to more frequent flushes.\n\nI would like to change this design to one where flushing happens asynchronously in a different thread, so that it is no longer on the critical path for validation.\n\nIn such a new design loading some percentage of recent UTXOs into memory may be worth it. Right now, I think it's only worth it if you actually have enough memory for (nearly) the entire UTXOs set.",
