Please describe.**\r\n\r\nMany namespaces are as yet un-annotated with a brief description, as used by Doxygen to generate developer documentation, locally or at https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/namespaces.html.\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\n\r\nIncomplete developer documentation may affect developer onboarding time, and this seems like low-hanging fruit.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\nTo add annotations to each of these namespaces. There may be existing descriptions elsewhere, if not I or someone else could attempt to describe each namespace, and reviewers could suggest improvements or alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\nIdeally each description would be committed by its author, so perhaps handling this with one PR that is then squashed isn't the best solution.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if this would ease developer onboarding perhaps that's more important.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nDocumentation at time of opening 14/12/2022:\r\n\r\n![doxygen-namespaces-20211214](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97605837/149532363-fc8e7c16-a253-417b-92bd-5a3b8419a2af.png)\r\n\r\n",
