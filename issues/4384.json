By increasing swap size to the size I had before (500 MB) I was able to build bitcoin successfully as before.  \nA secondary conclusion of potential interest to bitcoin builders on small devices is that make can throw weird and unrelated errors - like file not found and recipe not found.  \n\nI'm adding these notes for the benefit of others only because you replied.\n",
