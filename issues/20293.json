    "body": "In March, I made a backup of the wallet and continued using the node. In October, I restored my old backup. After restoring the backup, I found that the listtransactions command stopped displaying some transactions made during the period from March to October.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe listtransactions command displays all transactions in the restored wallet.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nThe listtransactions command in the restored wallet does not display some transactions since the backup.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Run bitcoin core in regtest mode\r\n2. Create a new address A and generate 101 blocks with sending a reward to the created address A\r\n3. Create a wallet backup\r\n4. Create new address B\r\n5. Send transaction to address B, write TXID\r\n6. Generate 1 block with sending a reward to address A\r\n7. View getaddressinfo B. Verify labels are not an empty list\r\n8. View listtransactions. Make sure there is a TXID transaction present\r\n9. Stop bitcoin core\r\n10. Restore backup\r\n11. Run bitcoin core\r\n12. View getaddressinfo B and listtransactions. Detect that the address does not have a label set and that listtransactions does not contain a TXID transaction.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core 0.20.1 on Debian GNU / Linux.\r\n",
