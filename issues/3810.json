I cannot allow a negative balance in any account, but it often happens even if i check the balance before allowing the user to send funds 'cause the transaction fee is added to the value being sent.\n\nHow do i work around that? Can't i set bitcoind to not allow negative balances?\n\nThank you\n",

Part of that would perhaps be a better solution for transaction fees.\n\nYou should not be charging user A for transaction fees because user B decided to fill up the wallet with lots of tiny transactions.  And that is exactly what would happen if you tried to charge users for the transactions that go OUT of the wallet (because the bitcoind wallet considers everybody's unspent outputs when creating transactions).\n\nSo, best practice is to either just consider transaction fees a cost of doing business and pay them out of your profits, or charge a fixed fee for every outgoing transaction and charging \"too much\" for some transactions and \"too little\" for others.\n\nFor ClearCoin, I created a \"FEES\" account, funded it with some coins, and then when transactions were sent I would move balances from escrow accounts to or from the FEES account when a transaction was sent  (sendtransaction, then gettransaction to get the fees paid, then move, if necessary, so the account balance was correct).\n",

Is there a way we can change/add RPC commands so that bitcoind has more block explorer type functionality? Maybe a `gettxsforaddress` command? This wouldn't have to be enabled by default, we could have a `txindex=1` type of option. Any thoughts? When I can run bitcoin-abe without having a separate block database I will be very happy. =)\n",
