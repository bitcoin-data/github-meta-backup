Additionally, the error doesnt happen if I simply lower or remove the dbcache parameter.  The problem is that there is an assert somewhere which blocks the debugger from breaking at the issue, so it's effectively masked.  \"out of memory\" is not a string constant anywhere, at least not one that Visual Studio could find.\r\n\r\n",
