    "title": "Ã–sterreichisches Deutsch - Translation (de_at) completely shocking unserious",
    "body": "I just checked out the new 0.9 release and started it and i was really wondering why i see the most strangest dialect/slang in my bitcoin client. \nAt first I thought i downloaded a fake version of bitcoin or a compromised one, until I found out that the default language was switched to DE_AT - which was obviously build only as slang/dialect language.\n\nAfter switching to DE it looks ok, but i was really shocked that I see such a nonsense-language (completely only slang) in my bitcoin wallet - AS DEFAULT. A place where i don't want to see any funny things!!!! There are much better places to see funny things than in the bitcoin wallet. This is absolutely not acceptable from my point of view.\n\nImagine that I want to show this to some other people, which dont know bitcoin - they will for sure think i want to make a joke about them. I can understand that it is maybe funny - for some 15 year old teenagers. But for introducing bitcoin as a mature payment service - this is a absolutely no go - specially when the DEFAULT language is adjusted to this dialect speech.\n\nAnyone agrees with me?\n![bildschirmfoto 2014-03-20 um 22 06 16](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/10075/2477663/8f0cc3b0-b073-11e3-92dd-ef223bfb16fe.png)\n",

I just downloaded the new version and started it - without changing anything.\n\nSure, I will try to work on it, but first i wanted to check if there is a missunderstanding from my side on how the bitcoin interface language should appear to the community.\n",

      "body": "Yes, thats exactly what I mean. de_at (austrian german) is a normal serious language (quite similar to normal german, but with sometimes diferent words), but the translation form transifex is completly joke/deep slang. It's not a dialect, it's just like spoken slang (like \"jeez\" instead of \"jesus\")...\n\nYou could compare it to en_us and en_uk, e.g. like if you would translate the en_uk \"OK/Cancel\" buttons to \"OK dude!\"/\"Jeez, sod off!\". This example looks us english (i think at least, sorry its not my mother language), but totally slang and therefore I see the de_at translation as completely unappropriate.\n\nI don't say anything against fun/joke translations like \"pirate\" etc.. But not as a serious translation for 9 mio normal people, which just have set their OS language to de_at, just because they live in austria.\nI was really scared when i started 0.9 the first time, because I thought there is something criminal (virus, manipulated binary,...) happening.\n\n@cs, @musha68k can you confirm this maybe?\n",
