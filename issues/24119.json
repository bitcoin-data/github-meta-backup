    "body": "There were few improvements discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23162#issuecomment-934338007\r\n\r\n  > Sanitize any strings coming from the faucet.\r\n    Require the captcha to be in a specific image format (this is currently left open), by making the input -:svg. This is a compromise as it would limit flexibility to change image formats in the future.\r\n    Limit the size/complexity of the SVG, limit dimensionsâ€”don't know if ImageMagick has introspection into this before actually rendering the thing, you might need a sifferent SVG parser.\r\n    \r\nI could also find one recommendation in https://lgtm.com/projects/g/bitcoin/bitcoin/rev/a6d9675d604827892e31a47994af3b64440f66db:\r\n\r\n> Except block directly handles BaseException. Handling 'BaseException' means that system exits and keyboard interrupts may be mis-handled.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what is the best way to handle exceptions in python however improving other things related to captcha and security are important.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\n- Python\r\n- Secure Coding\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
