    "title": "Consider Removing Message Signing",
    "body": "Signing arbitrary messages with Bitcoin private keys was always a bit strange. It was designed to handle only the narrow case of single-sig keys, and isn't well-defined for new address types. Worse, it doesn't allow for signing messages with more arbitrary scripts, and its not clear what the semantics for such things would be.\r\n\r\nSadly, the message signing feature is now being abused to \"verify wallets\" as a part of withdraw flows. This prevents Bitcoin users from using anything but an incredibly narrow set of scripts (in many cases *only* P2PKH, not even modern script formats, and definitely not multisig).\r\n\r\nRather than trying to rework it to avoid these things breaking Bitcoin, it seems like it'd be much better to simply remove the message signing logic entirely. If someone comes along with a proposal that considers a broader set of scripts and a more sensible design that could be considered.",

That may sound suboptimal, but a scheme that's restricted by design to some subset cannot do better either.\n\nThe question is just getting it implemented and accepted; perhaps there is just not enough animus to spend effort on. But if that's the case, I'm not sure if any (simpler, more restrictive?) alternative is going to fare much better.\n\nIn any case, I'm not in favor of dropping this feature until there is a reasonable more flexible alternative available and adopted. Bitcoin Core, as a wallet, isn't all that important in the market I think, so dropping support for a feature that seems abused by some is more likely to just drive people who rely on to other wallets rather than effect change in how it's used.",

      "body": "Given that all features require some effort to maintain, does this message signing code have a disproportionately high maintenance cost? You mention it is being abused to verify wallets, but I want to echo jlopp's comment about its usage being, in the absence of another well established standard (official or not), a way to arbitrarily sign messages with private keys. From what I have seen, this feature is mainly used to verify the integrity of hardware and software wallets--to make sure the BIP-32 HD wallet root key is still intact and the device can produce a signature. While it's certainly not ideal to use P2PKH, in this context, it doesn't really matter.\r\n\r\nI believe the scope of this feature's usage might be larger than most realize. Both Casa (\"[Health Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-cXaJgJqW0)\") and Unchained (\"[Key Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzKR3Yu44tw&list=PLUM8mrUjWoPRD1rz_wwG2qaTq2pQ7BZpM&index=21&t=1736s)\") are using it, which means every device they support has implemented this style of message signing: Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard, Keystone, Passport\r\n\r\nThe folks at CoinKite have even created a tool for verifying messages (https://checkmsg.org/), and it's my understanding that Sparrow supports this [as well](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-July/020766.html). In fact, I think any piece of software that supports BIP-137 has to have implemented this feature since BIP-137 is a proposal to extend this kind of message signing to support other address types.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I'm a little baffled at how this style of message signing became so widely used, as it was Satoshi code that came before the BIP process. The best place I've found it documented is the [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Message_signing), and even that is missing some critical information like the `Bitcoin Signed Message:\\n` magic bytes. It follows that Bitcoin Core's implementation is being used as reference, and its removal, especially in the absence of \r\n\r\n1. a single source of truth for technical documentation on how to do \"Satoshi format\" (a term I first saw [here](https://notatether.com/notabips/bip-notatether-messageverify/)) message signing and\r\n2. a suitable replacement\r\n\r\nwould be premature and create confusion.\r\n",

And after signing, you must make sure to wipe this transaction completely from your computer so no one else can broadcast it.\r\n\r\n> You don't fight bullies with hiding and give up things. You push back like people did when Trezor implemented AOPP.\r\n\r\nI agree with this. I think removing this feature does more damage to good use cases instead of preventing/delaying AOPP. I don't think any exchange or service which wants to implement AOPP will stop doing it because Bitcoin Core removed the feature. They can still give you the code to do it. For example, a simple website where you can download a tool and then upload a signature would suffice. They don't need Bitcoin Core. It's just code.",
