    "body": "The console program doesn't have a -license/-version/-copyright option, nor does it show the copyright and the license of the program.\n\nThe installer doesn't include the various licenses of the various \"parts\" of the program (GPL, LGPL, BerkeleyDB, OpenSSL license) (I mean the txt files)\n\nIf you include the copyright of OpenSSL in the readme.txt then you should include all the other copyrights (at least for BerkeleyDB, but I don't think doing a \"quantitative\" analysis is the right thing to do. All the \"external\" copyrights or none of the \"external\" copyrights in the readme.txt). The same for the MiniUPnP library, the QT library (that at least has an about dialog), the libqrencode.\nAll these copyrights should be also present in the about dialog.\n\nBoth the console program, the qt program and the readme(s) don't have/show a link to the source code repository (https://github/bitcoin/bitcoin). While perhaps putting the link would increase the number of persons that come here to ask questions, normally open source projects have links to their repositories.\n\nBoth the console program, the qt program and the readme(s) don't have/show a link to the forum discussion about the specific version (for example for the 0.7 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=110243.0= )\n\nThe asset_attribution.txt file isn't included in the installable release of the software.\n\nI think it should be made clear in the readme.txt that, while the license of the source code is MIT, the license of the combined program is a chimera based on GPL/LGPL/BerkeleyDB/OpenSSL (and note that the OpenSSL license isn't compatible with the GPL license, see http://www.openssl.org/support/faq.html#LEGAL2 ) and a discussion of what this imply (the combined product is protected by two strong copyleft licenses, BerkeleyDB and GPL, plus some clauses about advertisement and what needs to be written in the copyrights from the other licenses)\n\nI won't suggest fixes because I think the exact specification of these things should be decided by the higher-ups.\n",
