Right now `bitcoin-cli estimatefee 2` (on 0.13.2) is returning `0.00123063`\r\n\r\nHowever, if we plot the mempool by fees (blue line is 0.00123063 fee rate). We can see there's actually 2MiB of transactions that are already paying more:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1197\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-02-20 at 10 19 03 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9326759/23133232/0ba49c82-f756-11e6-859f-227811762504.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI also verified by applying a topological sort to the transactions (what older versions of core, and bitcoin unlimited do) and there is also >2MiB of transactions exceeding that fee rate.\r\n\r\nSo even if there wasn't a single new transaction created, our transaction at the estimatefee feerate will not make it in the next 2 blocks.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a known issue/limitation, so feel free to close if it's not useful.",

I think we need to improve the tools that provide information to the user, to help him make as good a decision as possible when it comes to fees. I dont know. Maybe the way in which blocks are produced have to change. For example braiding/juteing to reduce variance. I really dont know. But i think trying to make automatic fee estimation work is starting to become a headache. \r\n\r\nMaybe a simple fix in this case could be \"Warning, an unusal number of minutes have passed since last block so the fee estimation may be unrealiable at this point\" Or something like that.",

      "body": "It still can and does happen in 0.15, but I'm not particularly sure the issue is very actionable. \r\n\r\nOne hack you could do, is that if calling `estimatefee N` get the fee rate at the place of (N*4e6 + someSortOfLienency) weight of the mempool (sorting by by fee/weight)  and pick which ever is lower.\r\n\r\nBasically that way if there's a sudden surge in required fees (because of no blocks, or lots of high feee paying transactions), it never suggests something that is outright impossible. It's a total hack, so I understand if it's not wanted (and I'll close the issue).\r\n\r\n@morcos  thoughts?",
