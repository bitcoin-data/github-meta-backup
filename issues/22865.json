    "title": "Improve Transaction Tests Flags",
    "body": "_Originally posted by @glozow in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21702#r684235896_\r\n\r\nWhile trying to write transaction tests for CTV i've come across the pathological case of trying to specify flags.\r\n\r\nSuppose I have a script that is `<X> CTV`. CTV is an OP_NOP4 takeover, so when DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS is set but VERIFY_CTV flag is not, then it should fail. Therefore we need to mark DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS as excluded. However, when we exclude that flag, then the flag maximality check wants it to fail, but the txn is consensus valid.\r\n\r\nIf we were to just update the trim/fill flag functions, then we would be overly restrictive because we would set things up to e.g. always exlcude or include a flag when in reality it depends on the specific flags being set or unset.\r\n\r\nI think this can be addressed by adding 2 new fields to the test:\r\n\r\n1) flags that should be always on\r\n2) transactions that should be exempt from the maximality check\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can then duplicate some tests to test the combo of flags to check that NONE are excluded + the new NOP4 passes as well as the case where DISCOURAGE_NOPS is excluded (i.e., never set) that turning it back on (during the maximality check) is not a failure. \r\n\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on this approach?\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> Taproot does something sorta similar currently, albeit in Input standardness rather than interpreter although the distinction is immaterial.\r\nTherefore when taproot_active goes from false -> true, a transaction goes from invalid to valid. It's still a soft fork.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I'm talking about soft forks wrt script verification flags as inputs to the interpreter, not about our policy rules. I don't think the distinction is immaterial. Yes, I am aware that when taproot activates we will no longer discourage taproot spends in policy, while consensus rules will tighten, since it is a soft fork.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say is: [a property we desire in the script verification flags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e7c6ed605ca4991856603971f1306dd484dc2f75/src/script/interpreter.h#L37-L41) is that the addition of another flag strictly reduces the space of acceptable scripts. This property is what is being tested by the maximality checks in transaction_tests; they fail because `SCRIPT_VERIFY_CHECK_TEMPLATE_VERIFY_HASH` does not have this property. My suggestion is rather than bypassing this check in transaction_tests, implement CTV extensibility and maintain this property by adding another script verification flag. A method is outlined [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10699#issue-128042516).\r\n\r\n> When CTV is active, and the argument is not 32 bytes, we continue to treat as a NOP (I could probably clarify the situation a bit better here by making a new flag -- DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_TEMPLATE_PROGRAM, but the first DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOP check still causes this problem by itself).\r\n\r\nI believe the approach of having a `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_TEMPLATE_PROGRAM` would be better. Again, I don't think `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS` should be in the logic that handles the now-repurposed NOP4.",

      "body": "Sure. Suppose you want to introduce a new-fangled thing (like... say a Segwit V1 spend).\r\n\r\nWe want Segwit V1 to be discouraged for spending until such a time that Segwit V1 is active on the network, and if Segwit V1 failed to activate, we don't want it to become able to broadcast.\r\n\r\nTaproot in particular cheats at this, though, because it uses the witnessversion transaction level test. So the fact that V1 is discouraged does not require a flag. However, if we didn't scan witness versions, we would have to have a script flag for discouraging.\r\n\r\nTake for example, any OP_SUCESSX. If we add a semantic to it, before it is active we need to continue to set SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_OP_SUCCESS, and after the rule is active we need to set SCRIPT_VERIFY_NEWFANGLED_DOODAD which should cause us to not have SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_OP_SUCCESS applied. If it fails to activate we must continue to have SCRIPT_VERIFY_NEWFANGLED_DOODAD unset.\r\n\r\nedit: and it's not sufficient to use the TrimFlags/FillFlags because having unset SCRIPT_VERIFY_NEWFANGLED_DOODAD does not mean that SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_OP_SUCCESS must be any value nor does having SCRIPT_VERIFY_NEWFANGLED_DOODAD mean that SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_OP_SUCCESS must be set or unset, and it may be desirable to test that the opcode gracefully continues it's old behavior if the upgrade does not activate.\r\n\r\nThis is currently an issue for OP_CTV that I noticed (and patched) by making it have discouraged if fails to activate.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is problematic for the test_valid.json file because we can't write test vectors that are happy under all circumstances or unhappy under all circumstances. E.g., if VERIFY_CTV is unset, it means we failed to activate, so DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOP should takeover and fail an otherwise valid tx. If VERIFY_CTV is set, we succeeded activation, so the transaction should be OK.\r\n\r\nsee https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21702#discussion_r701305405 for more context. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22871 where I discovered we are not properly discouraging unknown sequences in the arg for CSV, nor in nSequence (two distinct, but realted issues -- txin.nSequence had some crufty reasons not to be restrictive, but CSV did not).\r\n",

      "body": "@JeremyRubin Thanks for elaborating.\n\nHistorically I think we used a different mechanism than Taproot used, where as soon as a new opcode was defined, we'd unconditionally remove DISCOURAGE semantics from it, and just always fully enforce it (correctly), even pre-activation, for mempool transactions.\n\nIt hadn't occurred to me that this approach we're taking with Taproot (where even valid taproot spends remain non-standard until activation) is in fact only possible because it's done through non-script IsStandard() rules, and doing the same through DISCOURAGE flags would violate the restricting-only property.\n\nHowever, I do think it's better to take that path, and treat future opcode spends as non-standard until activation. At the very least, it means a more predictable relay policy, new nodes switch policy in lockstep, rather than following adoption patterns.\n\nThat will mean indeed that adding FLAG_NEW_OPCODE to FLAG_DISCOURAGE is not a pure restriction, but that sounds like a reasonable price to pay.",

      "body": "I think there's four interpretations we want; one pre CTV activation:\r\n\r\n - `x OP_NOP4` -- consensus valid, relay invalid, doesn't matter what x might be\r\n\r\nand three post CTV activation:\r\n\r\n - `goodhash OP_CTV` -- fully specced and enforced per BIP119, consensus valid, relay valid\r\n - `badhash OP_CTV` -- hash doesn't match tx, consensus invalid\r\n - `upgrade OP_CTV` -- part of upgradeability, consensus valid, relay invalid\r\n\r\nThe specific case causing a conflict is that you want `goodhash OP_CTV` to go from \"relay invalid\" prior to CTV activating to \"relay valid\" after it activates which is removing a restriction, but indicating CTV is active is adding a flag, and it would be nice if that made things more restrictive rather than less restrictive.\r\n\r\nPerhaps ideally we'd say `DISCOURAGE_CTV` prior to it being active?\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be better to explicitly add a flag like `DISCOURAGE_CTV` or `DISCOURAGE_TAPROOT` for preventing relay  when the softfork is not active; then remove that flag once the fork is active and buried? That would preserve the \"flags only restrict things\" and still get the full variety of behaviours, and only mean adding a two flags instead of one temporarily?\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to ensure new nodes didn't relay CTV transactions before they'd caught up to CTV activation even after `DISCOURAGE_CTV` was removed from the codebase,  we could keep that behaviour by making standardness logic be \"don't relay **anything** until your tip sees all the expected soft forks as active\".",
