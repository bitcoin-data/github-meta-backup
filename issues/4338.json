A peer can easily cause bitcoind to waste time processing TXs, fill and max out the orphan tx database dropping random txs from the orphan tx database, wasting bandwidth, etc. A potential DoS target.\n\nThere is no requirement that a client must send an `inv`, wait for a `getdata`, than send a `tx`.  Currently, bitcoind will accept unrequested txs.\n\nI am proposing bitcoind not accepted unrequested txs, forcing peers to send an `inv` first and respond to `getdata` requests.\n\nI'd like to hear thoughts from others.\n",

      "body": "So, in some cases it makes sense from an efficiency point of view to\nbroadcast transactions (or blocks!) directly without advertising them\nfirst, if you _know_ the peer does not have them yet. If you just created\nthe transaction yourself or mined the block yourself, this is an obvious\ntruth.\n\nSo, alternative proposal: trigger DoS scoring when receiving an\nunadvertized tx/block that you do already have.\n\nPros:\n- Optimizes propagation latency slightly.\n- Is conpatible with all existing behavior in clients afaik.\n\nCons:\n- More complex network rule.\n- Assumes that every peer (or at least every NODE_NETWORK peer) will be\n  interested in the actual tx/block (which is currently likely the case, but\n  we don't know the future variety of network nodes).\n",
