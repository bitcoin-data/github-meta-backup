    "title": "Get rid of using the change address \"feature\" as default in the official bitcoin clients",
    "body": "Using change addresses cause a lot of problems, and don't have much benefit. The problems:\n- High learning curve - newbies don't know where their money is going. When they make a payment, they see their entire address drained of money on the blockchain.\n- Backing up your bitcoins becomes almost impossible. This is really the biggest problem with using change addresses, and it is a HUGE problem. How do you back up your money if your addresses are drained every time you use them? If you want to back up an address, you can do that easily. Just encrypt your wallet and copy it to various devices (your phone, external HD, USB drive, paper wallet, etc). If change addresses are used tho, you must copy to all your backups (as painful as printing out a new paper wallet) every time you make a transactions. That is intractable.\n\nThat intractability I think is a HUGE problem for bitcoins. People need a simple, understandable secure way of being \"their own bank\" and change addresses make bitcoins broken for most people.\n\nYou can use seeded address generators, and back up the seed. But there are no standard algorithms for doing that. If you find your seed in 30 years, how will you know what algorithm to use to use the seed on? You'd have to back up the algorithm with your seed. That's really hard on paper. \n\nIts in the best interests of bitcoin and bitcoins users to have a simple way to back up their money. It doesn't make sense to make backing up bitcoins far more complicated just to gain a little bit of privacy, especially when the technique [probably doesn't even work](http://anonymity-in-bitcoin.blogspot.com/2011/07/bitcoin-is-not-anonymous.html). Don't gear this currency toward power user - let power users use advanced features when they understand them.\n",

I don't mind my issue being closed once a consensus has been reached, but 30 minutes is not long enough for that to happen. Please indulge me with the knowledge that if my idea isn't reasonable it will be very clear within a week. \n\nAlso, I think you misunderstood me when I said there is no \"standard\". You have clearly done excellent work in creating an algorithm for doing this, but that doesn't make it a standard. The fact that it is a proposal at the moment means it is definitely nowhere near a standard. The importance of a standard is that people will be able to easily find ways of restoring their wallets in the future. By contrast, an encryption standard like AES would be all that's needed to safely store a bitcoin private key, and by proxy a user's money if change addresses weren't used. Your BIP is nowhere near the level of standard that AES is.\n\nI would appreciate some justification for the use of change addresses here. Please don't just dismiss this issue without some discussion. I'd also appreciate links to this type of discussion if you're aware of where it has taken place before.\n",

I closed it on the basis of the belief that you were unaware of BIP 32 and would have withdrawn your request after being informed of it.\n\nI think you're thoroughly confused wrt the \"standard\". BIP 32 is more clearly defined than Bitcoin _itself_ as a standard, and more clearly defined than any other existing method of actually encoding Bitcoin key material, etc. AFAIK all widely used wallet programs plan on moving to it in their next or next few versions, also establishing it as the defacto standard. It has several complete independent software implementations.\n\nWith the BIP process I'd been tending to model after the IETF process, so don't be confused by the language. Actual standards are just proposals until long enshrined by common practice— something that nothing in Bitcoin really is today.\n",

      "body": "Thanks.\n\nI'd actually consider the Bitcoin protocol itself a well-established standard at this point, with [hundreds of thousands of nodes](http://getaddr.bitnodes.io/chart/nodes/) and constrained by the strength of the current blockchain - no one can simply start using another algorithm because it wouldn't be bitcoins anymore.\n\nBy contrast, these proposals have very little keeping them around. It may well be the case that HD wallets will have staying power for a few decades, but there's nothing to ensure that - especially when (it sounds like) no program has actually implemented it yet. \n\nLearning about the proposal though, it sounds pretty nice and solves most of the problems I've been worried about. I still think that bitcoin needs to have a well established way to keep coins safe in the long run without any monitoring. A person should be able to back up a wallet, throw it in a time capsule, and someone in 50  years should be able to open it up and use the wallet. To me, this means that whatever algorithm is used to generate the right private keys should be identifiable and findable 50 years later just by looking at the backup. \n\nI know for a fact that if you stored a plain bitcoin address private key and threw it in a time capsul that labeled it \"bitcoin address\" - someone in 50 years could open it and use it. Is this true for your proposal? It would feel really sucky for people if they back up their stuff, and 5 years from now open it up and can't figure out how generate the right addresses from it. I don't want bitcoin to erode away because its too easy for people to lose their coins.\n\nWould you mind pointing me to somewhere where the efficacy of change addresses has been discussed?\n",

The keypool system that is used now in the reference client is indeed dangerous as you aren't even notified when you have to make a new backup.\nSuch notifications could be added to the GUI, and there is \"keypoololdest\" in RPC \"getinfo\", but for for all practical purposes deterministic wallets would be better.\n\n(I'm also working on a feature that lists the change addresses in \"Used receiving addresses\", this may help a bit too)\n",
