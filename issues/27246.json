    "title": "Bitcoin ignores datadir and blocksdir parameter in .conf",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Similar questions was raised in #15745 but it is marked as \"solved\" and closed.\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\nRegistry has a REG_SZ key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt\\strDataDir` (and there can be Bitcoin-Qt-regtest\\strDataDir, Bitcoin-Qt-testnet\\strDataDir for test chains).\r\nIt is created by default when bitcoin-qt starts first time and after editing/accepting first start wizard.\r\nChange database directory to non-default path, put there bitcoin.conf with datadir=databasepath and run bitcoin-qt (-cli/etc) and bitcoin ignores datadir path if no -datadir argument passed to a program exclusively.\r\n**The same problem with the blocksdir parameter.**\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nIn all situations behavior must be identical - if we start without arguments or pass \"-conf\" then use .conf \"datadir=path\" (according to sections [main], [regtest], [test] or global if there are no sections) if .conf exists and datadir are there. Now it is ignored.\r\nIf we start with \"-datadir=path\" argument it's works.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. For example, change `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt\\strDataDir` to `W:\\BitcoinCore\\strDataDir` (assuming our disk is W: and all paths in this example exists).\r\n2. Create W:\\BitcoinCore\\strDataDir\\bitcoin.conf with three lines:\r\n`datadir=W:/BitcoinCore/DataDir/main1\r\n[main]\r\ndatadir=W:/BitcoinCore/DataDir/main2`\r\n3. Start `bitcoin-qt.exe -debuglogfile=W:/BitcoinCore/debug.no_params.log`\r\n4. After a few seconds close opened wallet (bitcoin-qt) [Alt-F4].\r\n5. Start `bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=W:\\BitcoinCore\\DataDir\\main -debuglogfile=W:\\BitcoinCore\\debug.w_datadir_param.log`   \r\n6. After a few seconds close opened wallet (bitcoin-qt) [Alt-F4].\r\n7. Start `bitcoin-qt.exe -conf=W:\\BitcoinCore\\strDataDir\\bitcoin.conf -debuglogfile=W:\\BitcoinCore\\debug.w_conf_param.log`   \r\n8. After a few seconds close opened wallet (bitcoin-qt) [Alt-F4].\r\n9. Check filesystem and logs (attached).\r\n\r\nI've used Sysinternals Process Monitor to dig what's happening.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n**debug.no_params.log**:\r\n\r\n> Default data directory C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\r\n> **Using data directory** W:\\BitcoinCore\\\\**strDataDir**\r\n> Config file: W:\\BitcoinCore\\strDataDir\\bitcoin.conf\r\n> Config file arg: datadir=\"W:/BitcoinCore/DataDir/main1\"\r\n> **Config file arg**: **[main] datadir**=\"W:/BitcoinCore/**DataDir/main2**\"\r\n> Creating peers.dat because the file was not found (\"W:\\BitcoinCore\\\\**strDataDir**\\peers.dat\")\r\n> Opening LevelDB in W:\\BitcoinCore\\\\**strDataDir\\blocks\\index**\r\n> Opening LevelDB in W:\\BitcoinCore\\\\**strDataDir\\chainstate**\r\n\r\n**debug.w_datadir_param.log**:\r\n\r\n> Default data directory C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\r\n> **Using data directory** W:\\BitcoinCore\\\\**DataDir\\main**\r\n> Config file: W:\\BitcoinCore\\DataDir\\main\\bitcoin.conf (not found, skipping)\r\n> **Command-line arg**: datadir=\"W:\\\\\\\\BitcoinCore\\\\\\\\**DataDir\\\\\\\\main**\"\r\n> Opening LevelDB in W:\\BitcoinCore\\\\\\\\**DataDir\\main\\blocks\\index**\r\n> Opening LevelDB in W:\\BitcoinCore\\\\**DataDir\\main\\chainstate**\r\n\r\n**debug.w_conf_param.log** output is identical to debug.no_params.log.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\n1. Downloaded from [bitcoincore.org/bin](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/)\r\n2. Compiled from source\r\n\r\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\r\n\r\n24.0.1\r\n\r\n### Operating system and version\r\n\r\nWin 10 x64\r\n\r\n### Machine specifications\r\n\r\nNon relevant",

      "body": "It seems like there is a problem to be addressed here, though I'm not 100% sure what the best way to address it would be. You could have a datadir A containing a bitcoin.conf file specifying another datadir B that contains another bitcoin.conf file specifying another datadir C that contains another bitcoin.conf file, and so on.\r\n\r\nVarious ways this could be handled:\r\n\r\n1. Follow the path forever just merging all the bitcoin.conf settings values together and only failing if there is a loop.\r\n2. Follow the path forever, but just use the final datadir and settings from the final bitcoin.conf file. Make it an error or warning if there are settings from earlier bitcoin.conf files that are ignored.\r\n3. Follow the path until parsing the first conf file. Make it an error or warning if the conf file specifies a datadir with a different bitcoin.conf file and that file would be ignored.\r\n\r\nI believe the current behavior is basically (3) for bitcoind (but not bitcoin-qt, see below) except we are missing errors/warnings if there is an ignored bitcoin.conf file in the last datadir. Relevant code is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8c4958bd4c06026dc108bc7f5f063d1f389d279b/src/common/init.cpp#L20-L49\r\n\r\nI think if we keep stick with option 3 and just add an error if the datadir contains a bitcoin.conf file that is being ignored, that should be good enough for most use-cases. But if there are applications for options 1 or option 2, it would be interesting to know about them, they wouldn't be much harder to implement.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the behavior for `bitcoin-qt` is stupider than `bitcoind`, because if the user chooses a GUI datadir setting that is different *in any way* from the default datadir setting, the `Intro::showIfNeeded` function makes the GUI datadir setting sticky, overriding any value in `bitcoin.conf`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8c4958bd4c06026dc108bc7f5f063d1f389d279b/src/qt/intro.cpp#L259-L266\r\n\r\n~The comment in that code about \"make it possible to override -datadir in the bitcoin.conf file\" is not correct, because at the time of that `Intro::showIfNeeded` is called, the bitcoin.conf file will not have been parsed, so `SoftSetArg` will override any value `bitcoin.conf` may contain. It seems like that comment was not correct even at the time when it was written in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3935/commits/c61fe44194ea6d549adfe9ae944ce6fa3a467e0f from #3935~. (EDIT: Technically the comment is correct because it doesn't say it is always possible for bitcoin.conf datadir= setting to be applied, just that it is sometimes possible for it to be applied. It would been better if the code always let the bitcoin.conf setting take precedence consistently, but the comment does accurately describe what the code does)\r\n\r\nCleanest way to fix GUI issue would be probably be for Qt to override the lower priority `GetDefaultDataDir` value, instead of using `SoftSetArg` and changing the `datadir` setting.",

And if I don't need by any reason to write anything to %AppData% especially bitcoin blockchain now it is filling with unneeded files and crushing everything. To \"fix\" that I need to remember each time add parameters to programs, make links for that or any other thing must be remembered.\r\nI or any other IT in most of the cases if using it everyday will remember. But if just occasionally? (my case now) or just unexperienced user that just want to have his \"little SSD\" with just an OS and other things at external drives?\r\nNow it is a challenge and people can think that they are stupid because something goes wrong but they don't understand what's wrong. \"Googling\" it without results but there just a couple of bugs.\r\n\r\nSo answering your question - yes, it must check conf at default dir, open it, get parameters from it, use them, if there are datadir again - take conf from there... or, add another parameter that will allow recursion of conf's in datadirs? But original .conf parameters must be used 100%. datadir too - there must be placed indexes, chainstate etc.",

      "body": "@desirepl thanks for clarifying your use case, that makes a lot of sense. I see the appeal of placing a stub bitcoin.conf in the default location that points to other blocks, index, and log directories, as well as to another config file. This lets you specify disk layout separately from network configuration, and makes applications and command line utilities work \"magically\" as you say without requiring manual arguments.\r\n\r\nSo I can see how behavior (3) from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27246#issuecomment-1470284856 of only using the first `bitcoin.conf` file and not loading another `bitcoin.conf` file in the new datadir would be unappealing, while (1) would be more appealing. Behavior (2) would also not be helpful because it would only load settings from the last `bitcoin.conf` file.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't actually think you need behavior (1), because instead of relying on `datadir=` in the original config file to implicitly load another config file, you could explicitly specify `includeconf=` in the original config file to include the other config file.\r\n\r\nSo I think (3) might be a better solution than (1), as long as there is an explicit error when a datadir contains a `bitcoin.conf` that is being ignored. (Right now the second `bitcoin.conf` file is being silently ignored which is bad.) The reason I think that (3) could be better than (1) is that bitcoin settings precedence is already very confusing (see #17508) so merging multiple config files together when they might contain duplicate settings could lead to surprising and unintuitive behaviors. If you explicitly include another conf file with `includeconf`, then we can be pretty sure that you actually want multiple config files to be merged. But if you just happen to have two `bitcoin.conf` files in two different datadirs, it's not obvious that you want the files merged or you how want to merge them. You could accidentally have two `bitcoin.conf` files because of a configuration error, or a failed data transfer, or bad backup. So it would seem safest to just stop and treat this is a misconfiguration.",

There really is a `confdir`, `datadir` and `blocksdir` especially from the GUI perspective",

      "body": "> @ryanofsky there is a discrepancy between bitcoind and the GUI though. I think it comes down to this line:\r\n\r\nYes, that's a bug. That's the same line I pointed to above in \"Unfortunately the behavior for bitcoin-qt is stupider than bitcoind\" https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27246#issuecomment-1470284856. It's a simple precedence bug and fix should be straightforward.\r\n\r\n> the GUI also has this `QSettings` object which is stored in the system and is parsed before anything else. so if a non-default location is specified there the behavior changes.\r\n\r\nRight, this is basically the way it was designed and it means the bitcoin GUI and CLI tools can interact poorly. I think a better design make GUI and CLI programs both use `GetDefaultDataDir()` consistently. The GUI would still need a way to let users configure an external data directory but it could do that by just making a `GetDefaultDataDir()` a symlink to that directory (or a text file on operating systems that do not support symlinks), instead of recording the external data directory in a QSettings \"strDataDir\" field inaccessible to CLI tools.\r\n\r\n> It almost seems like `datadir` is over-used. There really is a `confdir`, `datadir` and `blocksdir` especially from the GUI perspective\r\n\r\nThis is probably true, but also probably there should be a simple way to just specify one data path. All of this could be revisited but if we just fix two bugs (bitcoin GUI precedence bug, and `bitcoin.conf` being silently ignored in second datadir instead of triggering a configuration error), I think this issue could be resolved)",

We migrated other settings out of QSettings which are not GUI specific in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/602 and we can migrate `strDataDir` as well to avoid unnecessary differences between CLI and GUI behavior (one way to do it would be the way described above \"I think a better design\" https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27246#issuecomment-1470504330).\r\n\r\nA simpler way to fix the GUI bug here would just be to add a `ArgsManager` `std::optional<fs::path> m_default_datadir` member and have the GUI set `m_default_datadir` instead of calling `SoftSetArg`, and have `GetDefaultDataDir()` return `m_default_datadir` if it is set.",

      "body": "> I did not address anything directly related to `bitcoin-cli`, I wasn't able to reproduce any issues and I'm not exactly sure what your cli issue was. Can you provide steps and unexpected behavior for that?\r\n\r\nThe issue with bitcoind described https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27246#issuecomment-1470006043 is that a config file specifying a datadir which contains a second config file will ignore the second config file with no warning. I outlined three solutions for this issue here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27246#issuecomment-1470284856 and implemented the third solution in a branch here:  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...ryanofsky:bitcoin:pr/ignoredconf\r\n\r\nI haven't posted a PR yet because I'm working on a python test which is a little tricky to implement.\r\n\r\nEDIT: This is now posted as #27302\r\n",

The problem you are seeing here is the problem I previously described:\r\n\r\n> Unfortunately the behavior for `bitcoin-qt` is stupider than `bitcoind`, because if the user chooses a GUI datadir setting that is different _in any way_ from the default datadir setting, the `Intro::showIfNeeded` function makes the GUI datadir setting sticky, overriding any value in `bitcoin.conf`\r\n\r\nin https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27246#issuecomment-1470284856\r\n\r\nSo you are seeing the `datadir=` setting in your `bitcoin.conf` file being ignored because bitcoin-qt's datadir logic is convoluted and was not written to support your use-case.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation for you personally would be to configure the GUI to use the default datadir and place your `bitcoin.conf` file in `C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin` instead of `W:\\BitcoinCore\\_strDataDir\\bitcoin.conf`. If it is important for you to specify the `blocksdir=` and `datadir=` settings in a configuration file on your `W:` drive instead of your `C:` drive, you should be able to just put `includeconf=W:\\BitcoinCore\\_strDataDir\\bitcoin.conf` in the configuration file on the `C:` drive.\r\n\r\nAlternately, you could configure the GUI to use the default datadir  `C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin` but make that path a symbolic link pointing to the `W:\\BitcoinCore\\_strDataDir` directory, instead of a normal directory. As long as the GUI is configured to use the default datadir, and not a custom datadir, the `datadir=` setting in your `bitcoin.conf` file should not be ignored.\r\n\r\nSo overall, I think we are aware of the problems here and have some reasonable solutions that should work for you currently.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem in the longer term pinheadmz opened a PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27273 that addresses your issue head-on by making the `datadir` in the bitcoin.conf file always override the windows registry setting, instead of conditionally overriding it. I reviewed that PR but did not think it was safe because it could cause backwards compatibility issues and subtly break working configurations. So I am working on new approach in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27409 that gets rid of the registry setting entirely, and includes a migration path and prompt to let the user resolve explicitly any ambiguities. I hope #27409 will be ready soon, but it's just been slow because it does have a lot of cases to handle so I've been trying to find a good way to add unit test coverage for all of them.",
