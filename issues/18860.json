    "title": "qt: function filterAcceptsRow seems to be unused",
    "body": "I have read in @practicalswift 's Issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18858 that there was an unused function found, so I thought, I could maybe also run a few simple searches through the code. Just for the sake of learning. For that I used *cppcheck*.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ncppcheck --enable=unusedFunction src/qt\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, there are many false positives, but one function seems to be lying dormant for quite a long time: [filterAcceptsRow](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/transactionfilterproxy.h#L55) from **qt/transactionfilterproxy.cpp**.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is another one in [addressbookpage.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/addressbookpage.cpp#L38). However, this one seems to have only a definition. I could not find its corresponding class member declaration. Not sure why, but there isn't one in [addressbookpage.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/addressbookpage.h).\r\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect is, that **filterAcceptsRow** from **transactionfilterproxy.cpp** was present since 0.15, without ever having been used, if I am not mistaken. And there were no changes until 0.17, when the other variant from **addressbookpage.cpp** got implemented. \r\n\r\nI don't understand the reasons, and it could be that I am simply missing the forest for the trees, but I could compile, run and also qt-test [my modified code](https://github.com/brakmic/bitcoin/commit/fa7f54c2dba75b8a81ed6e3d2bdeb8330942ff0b) without any failure. That is, without having compiled **filterAcceptsRow** in both of the classes.\r\n\r\nHowever, before opening a PR, I would like to ask experienced people for advice. Is there anything that I might have been missed? Do these functions maybe exist for testing purposes only?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n**---EDIT:** \r\n\r\n_There are a few more of them, but I did not check them thoroughly. Will have to recompile/retest the code first._\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsrc/qt/rpcconsole.cpp:123:0: style: The function 'Name' is never used.
