I can provide details on the compilation process if that's helpful. Maybe @esotericnonsense has any ideas, since he seems to have run bitcoind on termux before, though seemingly in a chroot. \r\n",

      "body": "Oh, I didn't realize you were running with proot inside termux, not instead of termux. It sounds like there are two possibly related problems here: 1) RPC commands being slow and 2) bitcoin hanging on shutdown.\r\n\r\nThe hang on shutdown might be easy to debug with a stack trace. You could compile bitcoin with `--enable-debug` and run it in a debugger (`gdb -ex run --args /path/to/bitcoind -your-args-here`). Then when the hang happens you could ctrl-c to the GDB prompt and run `thread apply all bt` to get a trace with the state of all threads.\r\n\r\nIt also seems likely the shutdown hang is related to the `ERROR: Error while reading proxy response`, and maybe worth trying without the socks5 proxy, if possible.\r\n\r\nRPC commands responding slowly might be harder to debug. Though from the timestamps in the posted log, it at least seems like the stop RPC is being dispatched pretty quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> The hang on shutdown might be easy to debug with a stack trace. You could compile bitcoin with `--enable-debug` and run it in a debugger (`gdb -ex run --args /path/to/bitcoind -your-args-here`). Then when the hang happens you could ctrl-c to the GDB prompt and run `thread apply all bt` to get a trace with the state of all threads.\r\n\r\nRunning in gdb (and skipping the illegal instruction) is interesting, because after sending signal 2 once, bitcoind hangs, but after sending a second signal 2 (from gdb), it actually terminates (unlike without gdb).
