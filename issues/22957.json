    "title": "Brainstorm: Improving Test Vector Formats",
    "body": "I've been doing a lot of work recently in the data/*.json test vectors and have noticed that the format of the tests (both the jsons themselves and how they are processed) is a bit brittle and clumsy. It might be worthwhile -- although a mild inconvenience to downstream consumers who depend on the specific format -- to convert the format from arrays to objects with key/value mappings instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtending the test vectors ends up being a bit of a chore, especially if the number of optional arguments grows and you need to insert a default value. It's also somewhat bizzare that transactions are defined as hex txs, it might make more sense to list the transactions as native JSONs (if a bit more verbose) as hex strings make the format harder to read. Going for JSON encoded transactions would make it easier to see what a specific test is doing, and would permit nicer auto-formatting of test vectors. There are also other test areas I noticed are missing, such as lockpoint declarations for used TXIDs, which could be beneficial for testing nSequence/nLockTime in transactions as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't think it's particularly high priority, but perhaps someone has an interest in working on this!",

      "body": "I find it confusing actually - esp. as there's no documentation except the test code on what the format of any particular file is - and some files use more than one format!  I'm not saying an official schema is necessary - but a table - in the test source code - would be nice.  \r\n\r\nPlus, and this has bothered me - each test vector has only exactly the data needed for the particular test it is used in at the particular time the test was written _even though when **generating** the test vectors more data was available_.  That additional data could be used, later, to enhance the tests using them or to provide new tests, with additional validation on the _same test vectors_.  Which would be nice.  What I'm suggesting here is that as long as you're going to the trouble to generate useful _correct_ test vectors drop _all_ relevant information into the JSON for that test vector so that subsequent tests - that you haven't envisioned - can be more easily written.  (Oh, and another use for the additional data: developers investigating bitcoin techniques and algorithms (i.e., learning it, getting better understanding, thinking/trying enhancements) will have a useful data set with which to work in ways the test author, who is generating the test vectors, hasn't envisioned for the tests being written.",
