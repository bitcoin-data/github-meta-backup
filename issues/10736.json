    "title": "Feature Request: The client should have a separate option for the storage location of the database data",
    "body": "After wondering why my bitcoin client was taking literally weeks to download the blockchain, I found out that it was going so ultra slow because I was storing the data directory on an external hard drive. After using a symlink to put the database data on my SSD and keep the blockchain stored on my external HD (via the symlink), my blockchain validation sped up by at least 6 fold. Details here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10647 . \r\n\r\nAnyways, because this can be so important for a non-frustrating experience for users who don't have enough SSD space, I'm requesting that bitcoin core store the database data on the same drive as the program executables, and give the user the option of only where to put the blockchain data (what is currently the `blocks` directory within the data directory). Alternatively, we could give the user separate options for where to store the blockchain and where to store everything else, with some info about why the storage location is important. \r\n\r\nIf I'd wanted to buy something with bitcoins in the last month, I simply wouldn't have been able to because my client was taking forfuckingever to sync up. Its really important to make these kinds of performance improvements idiot-proof so users with less technical savvy can use bitcoin core without rage quitting. ",

Longer term, it might be easier if there was a configuration setting or flag for storing all of the leveldb stuff on an internal drive and/or the blockchain blocks folder on an external drive.  As I mentioned in the pull request, this may not be the best way for these instructions to reach their intended audience so please feel free to redirect me.  Thanks!",

The blockchain itself, by nature is massive and doesn't need to be on local or high speed and throughput storage medium.\r\n\r\nThe data directory contains reasonable sized files and folders which could go anywhere, and an elephant of a directory called blocks (172GB today), we really need flexibility to optionally relocate this one.\r\n\r\nI have in the past tried multiple way to store either the whole datadir or just blocks on...\r\n - Network attached drives via SMB or AFP\r\n - Network attached drives via link\r\n - Locally attached USB 3.0 drive\r\n\r\nI haven't tried iSCSI NAS which I gather works but my two NAS attempts failed with corrupted data and the USB 3.0 drive had the same issues @fresheneesz encountered (thanks also to @sipa for the analysis!). Would be delighted if this could be worked into the pipeline.",

What we need is a gui wizard that asks \"what's your main harddrive? (SSD works best) [10GB required]\" and \"Which drive do you want to store the bulk of the blockchain? (150GB+ required)\". These should be simple dropdowns for the user. And this would be a perfect place to ask the user \"Do you want to prune the blockchain? To what number of GBs?\"\r\n\r\nIts great that its possible to split this up, but its a huge, error prone PITA doing this through command line right now. And many people might not even be aware its possible to do this even if they are already savvy enough to find these guides and correctly follow them. ",
