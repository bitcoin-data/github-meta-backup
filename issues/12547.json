They are in different baskets as they are unrelated to each other.\n\nWell all the keys are in the same wallet file anyway. While it's true the keys in an HD wallet are related, this is only observable to someone who knows the secret master key. Nobody has access to this who doesn't have access to your entire wallet file, which will be a total loss of funds regardless, even in non-HD situations.\n\nThere is potential downside of HD wallets though: they \"unsteal\" themselves over time. An attacker who got access to your wallet file but doesn't immediately steal everything and instead waits until the wallet gets funded. In case of random keys, over time he will lose access to the newer keys (though it takes a long time regardless, as the default keypool is 1000 keys now). We plan to make this sort of protection explicit by adding support for rotating out all keys and switching to a new HD master. This isn't implemented right now, though.",
