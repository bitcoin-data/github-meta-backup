    "title": "[RFC] Dealing with RPCs that have a lot of positional options",
    "body": "There are several RPCs that have several positional options which make them difficult to work with. The following RPCs have 3 or more optional arguments:\r\n* `gettxoutsetinfo`\r\n* `createwallet`\r\n* `getbalance`\r\n* `listreceivedbyaddress`\r\n* `listreceivedbylabel`\r\n* `listsinceblock`\r\n* `listtransactions`\r\n* `send`\r\n* `sendmany`\r\n* `sendtoaddress`\r\n* `walletcreatefundedpsbt`\r\n* `walletprocesspsbt`\r\n\r\nWhat can we do to make it easier for users to use these RPCs?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHere are a few possible solutions.\r\n\r\n### Options object\r\n\r\nAn oft suggested method is to use an options JSON object. This would replace all of the positional options with a single argument that contains a JSON object with each option named explicitly in it. This is a pattern we already use for several RPCs. This could be done in a backwards compatible way to minimize disruption to current users of those RPCs and new options would simply be added to this options object. However typing correctly formatted JSON can be difficult.\r\n\r\n### Encourage the use of named arguments\r\n\r\nSince all positional arguments have names, it is possible to use named arguments rather than specifying them all positionally. Through the use of named parameters, users would be able to have largely the same effect as an options object but without needing to make correctly formatted JSON. Bitcoin Core already supports named parameters as described in the JSON-RPC 2.0 spec. Any client that conforms to JSON-RPC 2.0 would be able to use named arguments. Furthermore, `bitcoin-cli` has ` -named` switch so that it is also easy for command line users and does not require correct JSON formatting.",

Regardless of that, named arguments are (IMHO) a better approach since it makes explicit for the reader what values are used for.\r\n\r\nI think another important thing our RPC server is missing is the ability to require option-style parameters to be passed by name, and to disallow passing them by position. Combined with #19762 this would let us safely provide RPC methods accepting only a small number of positional arguments, but a large number of named options, so there is no need for command line users to use json object syntax, but also no risk of getting options confused by trying to pass them by position. This should probably be simple to implement as RPCHelpMan extension after #19762 and would be equivalent to python's keyword-only argument feature `def fun(arg1, arg2, *, option1, option2)` https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/#rationale",
