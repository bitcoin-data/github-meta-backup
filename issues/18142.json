    "title": "Coordinate multi-sig wallet",
    "body": "Multiple people, or even just one person with multiple devices, want to setup a multi-sig wallet. The end result is a [descriptor wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16528), perhaps [miniscript enhanced](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16800).\r\n\r\nProblem: how do you coordinate this setup? See Electrum thread about the same issue: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/5715\r\n\r\nBonus points: it should also work with a protocol like MuSig that requires more than one round of communication.\r\n\r\n## Current situation\r\n\r\nI made a [tutorial and screencast](https://nthkey.com/tutorial) of a setup flow, in this case using two signers: a ColdCard  and an iOs app that I'm working on. It's based on the flow ColdCard uses to setup a multisig between two of their devices. [Specter wallet](https://github.com/cryptoadvance) uses a similar flow and the same file format, last time I checked.\r\n\r\nThe general idea there is for each cosigner to export a (JSON) file with information about their public keys, and for the other signers to import that. Derivation paths are standardised (see also #16895). All participating devices will derive the same addresses; the user just needs to enter the (same) threshold on all devices.\r\n\r\nThe above is pretty easy to implement.\r\n\r\n## Flexible signer policies\r\n\r\nThe above approach requires everyone to contribute a single key. Individual participants can't do fancy stuff like having their own internal multisig setup or some backup key after a timeout. Yet this could be very useful, e.g. imagine a user with two hardware wallets who wants to use an external service provider as the third key. That service provider may have some super fancy setup, but they don't want to ship custom software to the user, let alone merge their special sauce into Bitcoin Core. What if you could use the Green Address service, but with your favourite orange QT wallet?\r\n\r\nA more flexible setup could use miniscript, where each participant provides a policy language snippet they want to use. These are then aggregated with `thresh(M, policy1, policy2, ... policyN)`. The result is then compiled by a coordinator (one of the participants) and shared with the others. Each participant could use a simple public key, or some super convoluted scheme. The cool thing about miniscript if that each participant can verify, without understanding the policy of the others, that they indeed control 1/Nth.\r\n\r\nIIUC the plan is to [combine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16800) the powers of miniscript and output descriptors, and eventually add that to the wallet. Hopefully this allows for putting xpubs and origin info in both the policy language and the miniscript itself.\r\n\r\nThere is no current plan to add the policy language to miniscript compiler to Bitcoin Core, but we can start with a naive concatenation of participant miniscripts. Also AFAIK existing hardware wallets don't support anything other than plain OP_CHECKMULTISIG (`thresh_m(2, xpub1, xpub2, xpub3))` anyway.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we would use future proof syntax like the policy language, but in practice \"compile\" only to trivial, non-optimized, miniscript(s) that match what we can already do with descriptors.\r\n\r\n## Wallet composer file?\r\n\r\nWhat I have in mind is to (wait for someone else to) design a (binary) format, perhaps similar to PSBT, to compose a wallet interactively.\r\n\r\nIt would start with a coordinator. They populate the file with the \"shape\" of the wallet (YAML for illustrative purposes): \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: null\r\n- policy: thresh(2, participant_1, participant_2, participant_3))\r\n- participant_1:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_2:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_3:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the first participant, probably the coordinator, fills in their details. They can also list their (advanced) capabilities, e.g. if they're able to decompile miniscript or only understand very basic policies.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: null\r\n- policy: thresh(2, participant_1, participant_2, participant_3))\r\n- participant_1:\r\n   - policy: c:pk([00000000]/m/48h/0h/0h/2h/xpub_1/{0,1}/*)\r\n   - can_decompile_miniscript: false\r\n- participant_2:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_3:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe file is then passed to participants 2 and 3. Participant 3 will have all the info it needs to construct a final descriptor (set), and it can prompt the user to \"commit\" to that wallet:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: multi(2, [00000000]/m/48h/0h/0h/2h/xpub_1/{0,1}/*, ......)\r\n- policy: ...\r\netc...\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`{0,1}` is a fake descriptor syntax; for now you need a separate receive and change descriptor)\r\n\r\nEach participant needs to \"commit\" to the wallet, in the sense of storing it in their memory. This lets them display receive addresses, and it lets them check the change address before signing a transaction.\r\n\r\nIt then passes it to the other participants. If the devices all have screens, the user can now compare the first receive address as a sanity check.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core should be able to import this a watch-only descriptor wallet (or maybe it has one of the keys).\r\n\r\nIf any of the devices isn't smart / powerful enough to figure out the descriptor, then it needs to go back to the coordinator first. Conversely you could start with a round where each participant announces their capabilities (support for lock times, if they can decompile miniscript and understand their role in the top policy, taproot support, resource limits, etc). A coordinator can then propose a top level policy based on that.\r\n\r\nAdditional fields can be added e.g. to include nonces for a musig pubkey generation ritual. Also additional fields could contain friendly names for the participants.\r\n\r\nIdeally the whole thing is small enough to copy-paste or put in a QR code (e.g. bech32-ish encoded).",

      "body": "I'm pretty concerned about cross-device mutual authentication, and compromise of the computer that coordinates signing. I'm assuming a descriptor-based wallet is already used and devices are a \"little smarter\". How does one wallet device know that the other devices are doing what they're supposed to, and what attacks are possible because they don't? Since each device knows the pubkeys of all the others, those same keys can be used to bootstrap cross-device mutual authentication for the multisig signing set. The security of the assets is also a function of the coordinating wallet (online with UTXO set), which is kind of an invisible party to the security of the keys. Cross-device mutual authentication can solve the following problems:\r\n1. Has any device signed a transaction that the others didn't? (e.g. less than m keys in m-of-n have been compromised -- detect probing or failed attack)\r\n2. m of n operators can collude to create one extra transaction by signing two transactions per access to the signing device, and sharing the second transaction with the other m-1 operators. After m trips to cold storage signing legitimate transactions, they can create one extra arbitrary transaction that the coordinating computer (providing UTXOs) doesn't know about. (A single compromised operator with access to all m different signing devices, at different times, could accomplish the same thing)\r\n3. Have the devices been used to sign for forked coins or a 51% attack? (unexpectedly)\r\n4. Is the coordinating computer compromised (e.g. remove a threshold number of devices from the signing entity and take them to a different coordinating computer).\r\n\r\nPrivate communication channels between (offline) devices can generically be created using the SNICKER half-DH idea (if necessary -- but it seems like signatures might be sufficient), since each device knows the pubkeys of all the others. This can then be relayed, but not falsified by the coordinating computer. This creates an encrypted out-of-band communications channel between offline devices, to share whatever state is necessary to ensure that the data being fed to them is consistent across devices. The coordinating computer(s) is then holding some state, so kind-of is an epsilon participant in the (m+epsilon)-of-n wallet. I have two ideas that might be interesting:\r\n1. A rolling state hash: each device maintains an \"epoch\" hash defined as `h_{epoch} = hash(h_{epoch-1}|serialized_transaction)`. After signing, each device updates its epoch hash and *signs* the new epoch hash for relay to the other devices. Devices excluded from signing but used later (n-m of those) can be relayed the entire history of signing by the coordinating computer (or another signing device).\r\n2. UTXO set accumulator: each device can be fed the set of known/available UTXOs for storage. When one is spent, it removes it from its memory (and could refuse to sign a double-spend if desired). The device refuses to sign unknown UTXOs (forked coins). NiPoWPoW can be used to prevent falsifying the UTXO set.\r\n\r\nOne could define a BIP32 key path for mutual device authentication or half-DH/SNICKER encrypted communication.\r\n\r\nIt might be interesting to consider whether such \"rolling state\" could be used as entropy for determining the k value in MuSig. I'd love to kill that extra round of communication...\r\n\r\nWhat other attack vectors can be mitigated by giving offline devices an encrypted communications channel, and do you think this is valuable enough to implement?",

For many wallet types you can derive all future addresses during setup. PSBT can be expanded for things that happen before / during / after signing.\r\n\r\nOther wallet types, like Lightning, can't derive addresses at wallet generation. Some of that information can piggy-back in PSBTs as most steps in the lightning protocol involve generating a new transaction. But maybe interactive addresses generating requires yet another mechanism.",

I have tried to summarize everyone's points here:  https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-August/018132.html",

      "body": "For the situation of a central multisig co-ordinator doing a wallet setup from multiple hardware wallets, it may be worthwhile to consider the Uniform Resource (UR) specification, specifically the [UR Type Definition for BIP44 Accounts](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-015-account.md). \r\n\r\nUR is a standard mainly used to structure data concisely for transmission over QR codes. The specification in the link above allows hardware wallets to share details of a particular BIP44 account they can sign for. All the common script types are supported through an array of output descriptors, which is supplied along with the master fingerprint for the device. This allows the co-ordinator to select the appropriate output descriptor depending on the script type for the wallet it is creating, and then add the device to the multisig setup.",

Here is where I brought up the same concerns with Blockchain Commons https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/issues/28\r\n\r\nThere is also the existing BIP 45 https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki\r\n\r\nI don't think this should be Core policy or a standard within Blockchain Commons (I was not a part of these discussions, so maybe my interpretation is incorrect).\r\n\r\nOr, with Musig, Schnorr, and Taproot, do we just continue the work on implementing Musig keytrees for multisig? And say that pre-Schnorr multisig was never securely standardized/implemented?",

This is where the same keyset  is used for two different multisigs. It isn't as dangerous as address reuse, but it does mean compromise of one keyset's private key also compromises all multisig account descriptors that it is used with.\r\n\r\nCurrently Gordian Signer (a multisig signing-only app) doesn't store seeds, but instead using offline airgapped tools like LetheKit to derive the xprv/xpub. But we do have to store state as to what keysets have been offered to other multisig descriptors. I'd really like to see a standard approach on how to manage against keyset reuse to enable interoperability and portability.",

      "body": "This thread is timely, as this is exactly what we are puzzling through right now with Gordian Signer (for Mac, iOS and Android), which is a co-signing only app (no PSBT initiation, solely co-signing). In general, all the Gordian apps (wallet, signer, coordinator, server, etc.) are explicitly descriptor and multisig-centric — we are even considering dropping single sig. They also all are able to be airgapped and torgapped based on different security models.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-macOS\r\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Android\r\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Catalyst\r\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli\r\n\r\nAll of the above can already sign PSBTs, including animated QRs for large PSBTs, but the important design question is a standard way to accept a policy request (\"will you participate in a 3 of 5 with a timelock to 2 of 3\"), and if that is acceptable offer a keyset (e.g. [d34db33f/48'/0'/19']xpub6ERApfZwUNrhLCk…\", and hopefully get an account map back (an account map is a descriptor with no xprvs in it]. \r\n",

      "body": "So if my understanding is correct, the BCR-2020-015 standard offers an array for all script types, because the use case is for the offline signer to supply the coordinator with all the information that might be needed (the coordinator will then choose the one descriptor that is necessary to create the wallet).  That seems superfluous.  Why not have the coordinator start the creation process, send a 'policy request', and get a 'keyset' back like @ChristopherA  talked about? That seems much nicer, no?  The coordinator could then transfer 'account maps' to all offline signers.\r\n\r\nBesides that, a concern I have with BCR-2020-015 is the use of 'BIP48', which isn't actually a standard.\r\n\r\nIs there a BCR in process for policy requests or account maps? I guess that's why we're all here.",

Is that correct? \r\n\r\nAs I interpret the difference between a BIP44 definition of account, vs its usage in multisig under 48, the possessor of an xpub level -1 in BIP48 can create and watch all sub-accounts. This is not true under 48, as each account may have different other xpubs involved in their descriptors, thus can’t watch them.\r\n\r\nRelated, how does Electrum increment its account to prevent xpub reuse? Do you have some state that increments for each multisig you has been requested?",

      "body": "@ChristopherA \r\n\r\n> There does not seem to be any “sub-account” (not 0 but 1+) capability for this using the same xpubs. Is that correct?\r\n>\r\n> As I interpret the difference between a BIP44 definition of account, vs its usage in multisig under 48, the possessor of an xpub level -1 in BIP48 can create and watch all sub-accounts. This is not true under 48, as each account may have different other xpubs involved in their descriptors, thus can’t watch them.\r\n\r\nYou misunderstand BIP44 then. Even in BIP44, you cannot generate the public keys for multiple accounts from any xpub. xpubs are only possible for specific accounts, not across accounts. See [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/7e13d23d4339e5704f3c12d88704ee7520d16149/bip-0032.mediawiki#public-parent-key--private-child-key) (note that the account level is hardened in both \"purpose48\" and BIP44).",

Some Coinkite folks were involved with the standard, but it's not yet anywhere in their firmware. Specter Desktop doesn't support it either yet.\r\n\r\nA good place to start for Bitcoin Core might be implementing the Coordinator and Signer role as a Python helper script. It's easiest to implement with encryption disabled. The script could make calls to HWI (directly or via External Signer RPC calls).\r\n\r\nI added a reference to BSMS to the multisig labyrinth guide in #24861, closing this.",
