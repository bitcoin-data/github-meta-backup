    "title": "Large Scale Monitoring of Bitcoin Network and Prevention Mechanism",
    "body": "What I noticed is, that the seed nodes (from time to time) return dozens of bitcoin addresses from the same subnet (from france).\nThis, on the first sight, looks to me as a large scale monitoring of the bitcoin network.\n\nToday it happened again, that after 24 hours of runtime I was SOLELY connected to bitcoin nodes from the same subnet.\nThis pattern has been observed multiple times over the last month.\n\nWhat is going on there? And who is owning the huge amount of bitcoin nodes? And what is the intention? Monitoring? Netsplits?\n\nMy suggestion would be to go the same way as it is implemented in tor's circuit building algorithm,\nand disallow multiple connections to IP addresses on the same /24 subnet.\n\nHere the IPs (all are live, the error messages just popped up when I pulled my ethernet cable):\n\nWARNING [protocol]: Unable to connect to 46.105.210.67:8333 -
