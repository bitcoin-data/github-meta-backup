    "body": "Currently `dumpwallet` (and other RPCs that create server-side files) can scribble all over the file system, at least as the user running `bitcoind` permits.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if these were at the least limited to the data directory, or even a specific directory within the data directory, say, `~/.bitcoin/dumpwallet`â€”to avoid name collisions with wallets, lock files and database files. Overwriting is already prevented.\r\n\r\n(Issue originally reported by Florian Mathieu)",

I think a good compromise would be a `-backupdir` option, which would *default* to inside the datadir but can be anywhere (even `/` if you want the current behavior).\r\n\r\nIMO ideally there would be no RPCs that write to server-side storage at all. Any backups could be streamed over HTTP and backed up client side. That said, that would be a much larger API as well as code change.\r\n\r\n@practicalswift btw `backupwallet` is missing from your list?",

Systems with a huge wallet likely already have lot of memory to support that in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe only time I really had to look into HTTP streaming (so delivering the data as it was generated without accumulating it into a buffer) was for making it possible to download the UTXO set (#7759). But this turned out to be impossible to do reliably with our execution model and libevent's single-threaded HTTP server.\r\n\r\n(Something to keep in mind when using a JSON-RPC though, is that most clients are *also* going to waste a lot of memory parsing and storing the entire thing instead of downloading it to disk. This is necessary to get the error/status information that wraps it. For larger data it might be better to use HTTP directly so the result can be downloaded as a file.)\r\n",
