    "body": "this is in reference to this issue here\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/916\n\nI am able to perfectly recreate the described issue\n\nIf you start with a wallet that is pre 0.8\n\nReplace the bitcoind in /daemon directory with any .8.0+ bitcoind\n\nexecute walletpassphrase command this will instantly crash bitcoind\n\nAlso there is adverse affects when creating a new btc address when using the getnewaddress method. The newly created address/accounts will not be added to the wallet. and any preceding call will fail. getinfo() etc...\n\nTo fix this issue which is a NON issue simply download the desired bitcoind and simply execute it with the command one time\n\nbitcoind.exe -upgradewallet\n\nThis simple error which is not technically an error cost me a great deal of time energy and effort. \n\nThe issue 916 is reproducible by running bitcoind with an out of date wallet pre 0.8 since this issue was closed i had to create this post here. Hopefully this will allow the developers to recreate the problem which they could not create before.    \n",
