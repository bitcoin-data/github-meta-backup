    "body": "A friend of mine sent considerable amount of LTC to an exchange, but accidentally to a P2SH over P2WPKH Bitcoin address.  \r\n\r\nThe exchange operator told him he is using Bitcoin Core and `dumpprivkey [wrapped witness address]` doesn't work and he does not have time to figure out how to fix the user error.  \r\n\r\nSo I tested and indeed that's the case. I called `getnewaddress` and fed `addwitnessaddress` with its output.   \r\nSo the corresponding private key cannot be acquired with `dumpprivkey [wrapped witness address]`.  \r\n\r\nWhat workarounds are there to tackle this issue?",
