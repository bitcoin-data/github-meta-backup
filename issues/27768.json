One of the reasons to do so is to improve the quality of fee estimates.\r\n\r\nAcceptance via the p2p network has been discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27578 and is deemed to be problematic. This issue is for enabling non-standard transaction submission for the `sendrawtransaction` rpc only.\r\n",

      "body": "@sdaftuar wrote in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27772#issuecomment-1566232510:\r\n\r\n> Are you unaware that some of the DoS attacks that are prevented by our standardness checks include situations where a block might be mined that would take a very long time to validate, a cost that would be felt by the whole network? See for instance [https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=140078%7CCVE-2013-2292]]](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=140078%7CCVE-2013-2292%5D%5D). It is absurd that this issue would be ignored in a PR seeking to change mainnet behavior.\r\n\r\nI wasn't aware of this class of DoS attacks. And indeed, I can't think of a reason to disable this check. I am not sure if there are no better ways to address this than through policy, but that seems to be another topic.\r\n\r\n> Even putting aside the network-wide risks, I think it would be inappropriate for this project to bless a configuration that could lead to our users allowing themselves to be DoS'ed, which seems like the obvious outcome (I have no idea how we would provide documentation to our users to do these risk assessments themselves).\r\n\r\nI see what your saying, but I also want to add that the risk of users DoS'ing themselves depends on the source of the transactions they submit through RPC. The user might be sourcing transactions from a trusted and secure source that has robust (but different) DoS protection measures in place already.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking though, it strikes me as odd that there is no way for me to submit a transaction via rpc to my own local mempool that will later be mined by someone and happily show up in the chain. Thinking for example of >400kw txes. Perhaps there is a subset of standardness that is insufficient on the p2p interface, but safe for rpc?\r\n\r\n> In the most recent PR that tried to do something similar to this (which you also commented on), I [asked for the particular rules that seem to be problematic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27578#issuecomment-1535568784) (for whatever use case is motivating these PRs) to be spelled out, so that we can discuss -- and perhaps there are indeed modifications to our rules that would be fine and beneficial to the network if we adopted. If you'd care to do that here, perhaps progress could be made. Treating our standardness rules as a black box to be worked around, without any consideration for _why_ any of these rules exist, is not helpful and not going to lead anywhere. Concept NACK.\r\n\r\nThe reason that I am interested in non-standard transactions is the taproot annex. There seem to be many ways to benefit from this field, and it might also reduce chain space requirements for certain applications.",
