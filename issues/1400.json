I haven't been able to find any info about this apparent discrepancy.\n\nMy over-active mind is assuming that those who lose out because of the freedom Bitcoin provides are hard at work on schemes to make it infeasible.  One such scheme is to flood the block chain with transactions.  That's why I started looking at the size of the data file.\n",
