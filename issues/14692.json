This sort of works but I need to manually add nodes and then if a node is not open also to the outside I am in an isolate Bitcoin network. I also do not seem to be getting any inbound connections with onlynet=onion is this because my IP is always different under Tor and I need to post my .onion domain somewhere for people to find?\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n0.17\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nUbuntu 18.04\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.

      "body": "Although you have  8 standard connections (outgoing) and tor connections (inbound), when your node broadcasts a transaction you will broadcast to all outgoing and inbound (hence broadcast). I desire a set up where I can configure if my node sends its transaction ONLY to outgoing connections OR inbound connections. I don't think the software can make that distinction though so it is probably easier to have an option that only broadcasts via onion, as someone else mentioned.\r\n\r\nOne setup is to configure Tor support to the node, the public key will get created, bhasdhsa.onion, as an example and I can give that to other people and I will have inbount connections via that onion service. The problem still exists where I will still broadcast to both onion and non onion.\r\n\r\nAnother setup is to have onlynet=onion so that my outgoing connections are only to onion services, previous nodes that added me would still be able to connect as my clearnet port is still open/working. Now the final kicker would be a setting such as 'onlybroadcast=onion' which will make my node only broadcast via .onion service outgoing connections but still receive transactions from clearnet via inbound connections. This should also help solve the \"Why bitcoin over Tor isn't a good idea\" scenario, because your node is still opened to the clearnet.",
