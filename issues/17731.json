    "body": "Following issue #14343, in (the still open) PR #16878 I used a specific approach to address the non-deterministic coverage issue and I'd like to present it here in general form to a wider audience to get additional opinions on that approach because I think it can be used on other such tests to mitigate non-determinism. \r\n\r\nThe approach can be broadly described by a 'recipe' for any given test:\r\n- Run the coverage measuring script `contrib/devtools/test_deterministic_coverage.sh` many times on the test and write down all branches that sometimes run and sometimes don't.\r\n- Figure out how to cause all of those branches to run from the test body.\r\n- Add code at the end of the test (after all the assertions) that would cause all of those branches to run.\r\n\r\nThis approach worked effectively on the test DoS_mapOrphans in PR #16878 and I believe it can be used on some or maybe all of the tests listed in `contrib/devtools/test_deterministic_coverage.sh`. \r\nAs far as I can see, the only disadvantage for this approach is the seemingly unrelated code at the end of such tests required to ensure coverage but I believe any confusion can be eliminated by a comment explaining what it's there for.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think?",

      "body": "@davereikher \r\n\r\nVery glad that you are interested in tackling the remaining instances of non-determinism in our unit tests. That's great!\r\n\r\nOne of the problems with line coverage non-determinism is that it makes it impossible to reason about line coverage with precision. More specifically having line coverage non-determinism makes it impossible to say if a PR will reduce or increase line coverage since the delta in line coverage due to the suggested change will be added to a random variable (the existing line coverage which varies between runs due to non-determinism in a few tests).\r\n\r\nIn cases where the ideal solution of making the tests deterministic by adjusting the existing test logic is not possible or hard to achieve I think your suggestion makes sense as a second-best alternative. That will give us a stable line coverage number and thus the ability to reason about the line coverage impact of suggested changes :)\r\n\r\nSince this only is relevant for a small set of tests I don't see any real downside of what you suggest: if/when \"proper test determinism\" is introduced for the test in question the temporary fix suggested can simply be removed, and a comment on why the extra testing code is needed will eliminate any confusion.\r\n\r\nAgain: thanks a lot for working on making our unit tests deterministic in terms of line coverage! :)\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to ping me if you need a test determinism PR reviewed or if I can help in any other way :)",

      "body": "So, if I understand correctly, there currently exists a problem where it is unclear whether a PR increases or decreases coverage. It would be beneficial to make all tests deterministic but it's not clear how to do it since it was observed (see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16878#discussion_r331741093)) that the non-determinism is not due to a changing seed but most likely due to concurrency issues. I see the following options:\r\n1. Leave everything as is to avoid \"painting the lines green\", ignoring the non-deterministic coverage issue,\r\n2. Use the proposed method, at least temporarily, until a better permanent solution is found,\r\n3. Re-write the tests with the non-deterministic coverage to make it deterministic, using a different approach,\r\n4. Remove the non-deterministic tests,\r\n\r\nI guess the fourth option is most likely not realistic, as it would reduce coverage significantly. The third option is the best in it's outcome, but I think it would take a very large amount of effort. Perhaps it's not even possible without some serious refactoring for some of the tests. This is due to the fact that the non-determinism is not just a seed issue, it's most likely concurrency-related and I personally don't see another way to relatively easily achieve coverage determinism without deep changes to those tests and some of the fixtures.\r\nThe second option can be seen as a temporary patch which addresses the issue that a small amount of tests were written without consideration of coverage determinism. They therefore introduced an inability to track how a new PR affects coverage. Thus a patch in the form of \"covering the lines green\" is requied to resolve this 'bug'. I agree that from an aesthetic point of view the patch may be a ugly, but given the current situation I think it contributes overall and makes work more efficient by allowing to see how a new PR affects the coverage.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's also a question of how important knowing if a new PR affects coverage is. If it's very important, maybe even option 4 can be considered. If it's not at all, we can close the issue. So I think eventually it boils down to whether the effect of the new PR question is more important than the aesthetics of the tests?",
