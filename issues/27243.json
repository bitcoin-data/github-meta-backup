I will follow these in the future for PRs trying to avoid reviews:\r\n\r\n1. Open a PR with same commit and add comments\r\n2. If 1 doesn't work. Send email to bitcoin-core-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org\r\n3. If 2 doesn't work. Use an invite only [service](https://i.imgur.com/HUGS3gG.png) to post anonymous reviews",
