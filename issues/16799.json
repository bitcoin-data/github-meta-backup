    "body": "# State of the Repo + Static Analysis Report  (🆕), August 2019\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nFor all fans of statistics (and **static analysis!**)  – enjoy this slightly delayed August edition! Sorry about the delay: the data is from the end of August. **New in this edition: a static analysis report! Currently in beta.**\r\n\r\n803 (+13) authors have contributed to the project (merged contributions). Thank you! ❤️\r\n\r\nThe repo contains 491&nbsp;957 (+1&nbsp;814) lines of text and 1&nbsp;761 (+0) files.\r\n\r\n21&nbsp;212 (+310) commits have been made of which 4&nbsp;136 (+116) are merge commits.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 279 (+2) open pull requests from in total 85 (+1) contributors.\r\n\r\nIf all open pull requests were merged the project line count would grow by roughly 9 percent.\r\n\r\nThe total set of open pull requests adds 71&nbsp;707&nbsp;lines, removes 25&nbsp;810&nbsp;lines and touches 2&nbsp;328&nbsp;distinct files.\r\n\r\nThe \"median open pull request\" adds 56&nbsp;lines, removes 18&nbsp;lines and touches 4&nbsp;files.\r\n\r\nPrevious edition: [State of the Repo, July 2019](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16506)\r\n\r\n## Static analysis report\r\n\r\nThis is the monthly static analysis snapshot for the [source tree `db67101c`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/db67101c748c208cced8e9b76a66d57cd48fbf6e).\r\n\r\n__Note:__ Before submitting any pull requests to Bitcoin Core, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). In particular the section on [__refactoring__](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#refactoring), as it likely applies to changes generated with these tools:\r\n\r\n> Trivial pull requests or pull requests that refactor the code with no clear benefits may be immediately closed by the maintainers to reduce unnecessary workload on reviewing.\r\n\r\n__Disclaimer:__ These results have not been confirmed, and may be improbable or flat out invalid, but it's worth having a list of these somewhere and keep track of changes over time. The results may be subject to a large number of false positives and false negatives. The results are not necessarily complete. Please report if you see any spurious results that you think could be filtered out automatically in the next edition to reduce noise. This report is currently in beta: feedback welcome.\r\n\r\n### Functions that are both unused and untested\r\n```\r\nbitcoinconsensus_version\r\nBlockFilter::BlockFilter(BlockFilterType, uint256
