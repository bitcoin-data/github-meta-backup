    "title": "[Performance] LevelDB options.max_open_files = 64 parameter (Windows 10)",
    "body": "### Observations\r\n\r\nBitcoind startup performance (Fully synced node)\r\n\r\nWhile running procmon when starting bitcoind.exe I noticed millions of file open/read/close events to the chainstate leveldb dir. The high frequency file open/close events occurred during this: (init.cpp)\r\n\r\n`    if (!ActivateBestChain(state, chainparams)) ..`\r\n\r\nInvestigating this further led me to level DB's LRUCache. We use a value of 64 for max_open_files:\r\n\r\n`options.max_open_files = 64;` in `static leveldb::Options GetOptions(size_t nCacheSize)`\r\n\r\nAs far as I know and read online the default for LevelDB is **1000**.\r\n\r\nI've noticed some (I consider significant) performance improvements by increasing the max_open_files var to the default 1000. This avoids the overhead of many thousand (per second) open/close operations on the files in the chainstate dir. This also avoids the unnecessary high frequency allocations created each time on the heap (LevelDB's Win32RandomAccessFile objects).\r\n\r\nI am not a levelDB expert but from what I can gather this value needs to not exceed the maximum number of file handles that the process can have but 64 seems a bit on the low side.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nHere are some of my results while doing 5 iterations of max_open_files = 64 and 1000. The timings are timing the `ActivateBestChain` function call (Using high resolution timer).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6394033/34693985-689717b6-f4bd-11e7-87bc-873048ee2024.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n\r\n1) Why did we chose 64 as the fixed global value of max_open_files?\r\n2) Should we expose the max_open_files via a command line option or should we be smarter with this value since it has performance benefits (Perhaps even with initial chain sync?)\r\n\r\nMy system:\r\nDell XPS 17 9560 i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.8 GHz, 2801 Mhz, 4 Cores. 16GB Ram, 512GB PCIe SSD, Windows 10\r\n\r\nRelease build (MSVC optimizations on /O2)\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting if someone can try some tests on a Linux machine. It could be related to some overhead with Windows' CreateFile while opening the files.\r\n\r\nIf it's accepted that this is a performance bottle neck then I am happy to propose a solution or do more research on this parameter. At the minimum expose it as a setting or command line option.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDonal",

I believe that the frequent close/munmap calls is causing the kernel to make poor decisions about page cache management during IBD/reindexing, which is what I'm trying to fix.\r\n\r\nThere's a trick to make this work safely on Linux (maybe other POSIX systems as well?):\r\n * If you close a file descriptor that is associated with a mmap mapping, the mapping **remains valid and does not count against your file descriptor limit**\r\n * The default mmap limit on Linux (`sysctl vm.max_map_count`) is 64k, which is huge and way more than we need (currently the chainstate database has about 1500 files in it on mainnet)\r\n * The only overhead of doing this is the extra page table entries, which uses a negligible amount of extra memory\r\n\r\nThis means that the code can be reworked to have **all** chainstate LevelDB files mmaped (for reads at least) simultaneously, without adversely affecting performance or using a lot of file descriptors. However, it does require some surgery to LevelDB internals. In concept the change sounds minimal but I have to do some actual hacking on the LevelDB code to see what the diff actually looks like when it's fully implemented. I plan to work on this and present the changes for discussion if it ends up being sufficiently minimal/self contained.",
