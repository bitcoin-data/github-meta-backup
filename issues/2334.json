That's after my computer has been offline for over 12 hours, and so can't possible be true.\n\nThe \"1 minute ago\" seems to mean \"the block was generated 1 minute before it was received\", but that's not what the message says.  I don't really care how long elapsed between block generation and my client receiving it.  I care how old the block is now (because that tells me whether I'm up to date or not), and that's not what is displayed.\n",

      "body": "I wanted to open this issue a while ago but thought maybe I don't understand something. But that's true, the message is wrong when you've caught up. I've done a bit of grepping of the source and found the related function, it's BitcoinGUI::setNumBlocks(int count, int nTotalBlocks) on line 500 @ src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp. The problem is that it sets the tooltip just when the block is received and the time is (QDateTime::currentDateTime - lastBlockDate). Obviously, it's the time between block generation and receiving by your node thereby it's pretty useless. I propose calling this function on several events from labelBlocksIcon, progressBarLabel and progressBar. Maybe onMouseMove or onTooltip. I'm not into Qt at all and I don't know which events can be processed and how they're called. I'll try to implement this myself, should be pretty straightforward but I don't promise anything.\n",

This is a qt limitation. I suppose to really fix this the tooltip should be drawn manually.\n\nEdit: issue #2233 was about the same problem\n",

Then we can update only the time once in a while following \"the least surprise\" principle as you said. I set 10 seconds to clearly see the update process but it may be as well 60 seconds since the tooltip doesn't show seconds after the first minute. I understand that the code sanity is a priority over features so my dirty hack definitely needs variables renaming and such to comply with the project's guidelines. But at least it's something working already.\n",

I can understand if people wanted it to say \"3 minutes ago\" instead of showing a time that is 3 minutes earlier than the current time, but I doubt anyone wants the current system which is to show \"3 minutes ago\" and keep it showing \"3 minutes ago\" until the next block is received, which could be days later if I go offline.\n\nI would prefer \"x ago\" instead of a timestamp if the x was true, but \"x ago\" where x is calculated once and never updated is truly useless, and reminds me of an old bug from 1957: http://youtu.be/-tjHlFPTwVk\n",
