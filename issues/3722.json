    "title": "mempool transaction expiration",
    "body": "Sparked by another discussion (#3721), it seemed useful to open an issue on transaction expiration.\n\nIt has been my longstanding contention that transaction lifetimes should be more deterministic. If a transaction does not confirm within a set period, the mempool should forget it, rather than accumulating garbage and leaving the transaction in limbo.\n\nOne proposal bandied about on IRC is to expire any transaction from the memory pool, that does not confirm within X blocks.  Proposed value for X is 2 days, 144*2.\n\nIt is always the responsibility of the client to retransmit a transaction until it is confirmed.  If a client ceases retransmission, and waits X blocks, they have a reasonable chance of presuming the network has forgotten the transaction [assuming the network has mostly upgraded]. That enables the client to recover the dead transaction, including double-spending with a higher fee.\n\nThis seems to accomplish two useful goals:  preventing the mempool from accumulating garbage, and making transaction lifetime more deterministic [within a certain probability].\n\nRelated: mempool superblock redesign (#3723).\n",

      "body": "One thing I've wondered about this is if its possible to avoid an expiration replacement race.\n\nSay 2 days minus one second after your tx is originally broadcast, you rebroadcast: your peers still have it so it goes nowhere and your broadcast has no effect.  Say it's 2 days plus one second: some nodes still have it and so the broadcast is not very effective... and your transaction still falls out of memory pools.\n\nThis all creates a window where an aggressively broadcasting double-spender could replace the transaction in memory pools.  \n\nObviously double-spend exclusion can't be counted on, and perhaps will someday be mooted by a more greedy miner policy,   but I think it would be unfortunate to weaken the exclusion as a side effect of this if it can be avoided.\n",

Merchants who accept zero-conf transactions are already aware of the risks of operating outside of consensus, and expiration should not measurably change their business costs or calculus.  Nobody is going to bother with an expensive, complicated attack on a 3-day-old transaction when a simple network race can more easily execute a partitioning double-spend attack.\n\nIt seems worth it, to give bitcoin users for the first time a mostly-predictable way to handle stuck transactions.\n",
