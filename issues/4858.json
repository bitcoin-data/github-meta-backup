That I could help with much more, as I'd like to see it happen. We already have a system for building dependencies on/for various platforms (it already builds for windows), it would need to be adapted for use on Windows. You could then use them to build bitcoin with mingw, or coerce it into building with msvc\n\n@theuni We could do that but to build all the dependencies and BitcoinD you don't need mingw. I do have a bitcoin-dev-msvc project which builds them all and runs on MS natively. \n\nQT was outside of my area of interest so far. It could be added, but I do not see it as a problem either, it was done once by Claire DuSoleil for version 0.8.6.\n",

Because of ABI issues you must build the dependencies with the same compiler that you use for bitcoin itself.\n\nHis idea is to make it easier to build in mingw in windows (i.e. just `make -C depends && ./autogen.sh && ./configure` like in other OSes). But that's completely parallel to the topic of building in MSVC. Different people have different choices in compiler, and it's no problem to accommodate multiple choices as long as someone actively maintains them.\n",

Nothing just works instantly on any new platform.  automake/autoconf in itself is platform independent as well, but when building native software there are always platform-dependent weirdnesses that have to be taken into account.\n\nI don't feel like arguing the pros and cons of build systems here. We only recently switched from loose makefiles to autoconf/automake, which is only now starting to stabilize and \"just work\". Switching to something else again means going through another phase of build system frustration.\n\n(if you want my personal opinion about build systems: I prefer cmake, which can generate MSVC solution files.. but as said that doesn't matter here)\n",

I can't just say \"HEXDUMP xyz file\" in command prompt, I can not do in in simple Perl either. So for me to just generate these files I have to go through entire build process with Mingw on Windows. I already spent whole weekend trying to generate these few files and for what?!\n\nDon't get me wrong but it looks like you deliberately trying to make this process as hard as possible for other people working on other platforms. I do understand that it is probably my frustration talking and reality is different but it definitely looks like it for me at the moment.\n",

What happens when you get to protoc and qt. Then what? Check those in too?\n\nWe're not going to reinvent our build process for this. If you would like help with the porting process, I've offered that help. But trying to shoe-horn our source tree into msvc is an exercise in futility. For both of us. If you continue to discuss this as though our reasoning has been arbitrary and can be tossed aside, you will continue to be met with opposition.\n\nA batch script should be written that builds the necessary tools with mingw, builds the dependencies with them, and add them to a path relative to the solution file.

I could not get my hands on a copy of these to see what needs to be done to generate headers. Can you point me to where I can download all the generated headers or perhaps you could just email them to me?\n\nAs for your offer of help with MinGW setup I would gladly accept it. I am in a process of setting WIN7 VM with MinGW but got stuck in a middle of executing of Configure script. Although all dependencies are built and installed the script couldn't find any of them. I am using this one as a guide but it fails if executed in described order: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=149479.0\n",
