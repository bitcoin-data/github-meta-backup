    "title": "LevelDB performance when running on microSD card",
    "body": "Let's consider the following setup:\r\n- the node is running on a single board computer (SBC)\r\n- the blocksdir is located on external drive\r\n- the datadir is located on system microSD card\r\n\r\nAs SD cards were initially made for pure sequential workloads the performance of LevelDB on average SD card is quite poor (as logs say). When the background LevelDB thread begins compaction the node becomes pretty unresponsive.\r\n\r\nDo exist any LevelDB option tweaks that could trigger a compaction less frequently? It could be helpful during reindexing at least.",
