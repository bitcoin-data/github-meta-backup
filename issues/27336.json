    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nIf you have a privkey-enabled wallet, you should be able to import a public descriptor where your wallet knows the private keys corresponding to (some of) the xpubs in the descriptor.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nIf you try to import a descriptor into a Core wallet that has private keys, and you only provide the public descriptor, it will fail with the error `Cannot import descriptor without private keys to a wallet with private keys enabled`. To do the import, you need to pull the private keys out of the wallet, populate the descriptor with them, recompute the checksum, then try again. This is unsafe and unnecessary.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nBefore erroring out, the wallet should check whether it actually has private keys that would allow it to import the descriptor.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "FWIW, I think this is a good idea. I recently ran into this when trying to create a fairly complicated miniscript fragment: I created the wallet with private keys enabled and copied out some of the xpubs to use in my `wsh(miniscript)` descriptor. I was then unable to import it into the wallet until I ran `listdescriptors true` and replaced the xpub with the xpriv before then re-importing.\r\n\r\nI agree that it's dangerous to require dumping the xpriv to the command line. I suppose the counter-argument is the keys would ideally be on a signing device and you would only be creating a watch-only wallet in core, but I think there is merit to supporting a hot-wallet use case, as well.",
