    "body": "I've implemented about 13 different fuzzers that each fuzz different parts of the Bitcoin core source code. Collectively these result in much more code coverage than ```src/test/test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp``` but are not exhaustive (yet).\r\n\r\nI could not find any issues despite running the fuzzers for a long time.\r\n\r\nIf you want it, I'll make a pull request. I'm also willing to work together with someone who has more intimate knowledge of the Bitcoin core source code to complement the current set of fuzzers.\r\n",

I've played around with different ways to extend the fuzzing coverage myself, so I'd be really interested in checking your stuff out and how you've attacked the problem.\r\n\r\nIf you are not yet ready to submit a proper pull request I'd be glad to take a look at it as-is. Just dump the code in its current state in a gist, repo or somewhere convenient for you and I'll figure out the rest :-)\r\n\r\nFor reference, see some previous discussions about improving Bitcoin fuzzing :\r\n* [tests] Add fuzz testing for BlockTransactions, BlockTransactionsRequest and CBlockHeaderAndShortTxIDs deserialization, #10409\r\n* [tests] Add libFuzzer support, #10440\r\n* [tests] Speed up fuzzing by ~200x when using afl-fuzz, #10415\r\n* Feature request: Make Bitcoin libFuzzer-friendly and consider integration into the OSS-Fuzz project, #10364",

      "body": "@laanwj I think @sipa raised a good point above that there might be benefits to have a separate binary for each fuzzer. In addition to avoid confusing the fuzzer (unnecessary re-use of fuzzing inputs between the fuzzers - just confirmed by @kcc! :-)) it has the benefit of making it more obvious when a given fuzzing session has reached a state where no new paths are found.\r\n\r\nWith the current \"first part of input data chooses the fuzzer\"-approach taken by `test_bitcoin_fuzzy` it is quite hard to see which fuzzers that are still hitting new paths (i.e. keep fuzzing!), and which have reached their max depth/\"max path count\" (i.e. consider stop fuzzing).\r\n\r\n+1 for splitting the fuzzers into one binary each\r\n\r\nGiven a one-binary-per-fuzzer setup it would be quite trivial to write a script that gives each fuzzer a running time of X time units each, and then measures the achieved coverage. Having this kind of fuzzer shootout would be quite fun and will probably increase the interest in writing Bitcoin fuzzers!\r\n\r\nAlso it would make it easy to measure the _incremental_ coverage gained from adding a new fuzzer which would be handy during fuzzing development.",

Now if we only could get Bitcoin onto Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure! :-)\r\n\r\nPersonally I fuzz Bitcoin and the Swift compiler 24/7 (see [results here](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20author%3Apracticalswift%20is%3Amerged%20crasher%20)), but unfortunately I meet a very real budget constraint that forces me to choose wisely between fuzzing targets based on path discovery rate :-)\r\n\r\nWhen I have you here in this thread - I just wanted to take the time to send a huge thank you for libFuzzer and the sanitizers. Amazing tools! Really impressed by your work!",

If you want to switch to multiple executable, it will have to be a separate `configure` flag that is disabled by default e.g. `--enable-fuzzers`.",

      "body": "Hey @Dor1s great response.  I read a bit more about AFL specifically and gmaxwell's response is starting to make a bit more sense.  AFL suffers from a hash collision problem in the 64Kb shared_mem array (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt) and I'm wondering if that is also another motivation to remove this one-fuzzer-for-all approach?  But it seems that getting rid of, say, ~20 edges/branches wouldn't really mitigate this problem at all if the execution traces are particularly deep (i.e. have lots of edges and therefore a potential for collision).  Removing the switch specifically to avoid collision doesn't seem to be much of a motivation - the real motivation would be to avoid confusing the fuzzer with erroneous feedback that's applied to the wrong messages.  What do you think?",
