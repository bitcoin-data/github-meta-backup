    "body": "See https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/RelayNode/issues/12#issuecomment-128234446. Essentially, there is no tie-breaking mechanism in the transaction selection, and we end up picking essentially a random subset of transactions that have the same feePerKb. Current blocks/mempools contains  ton of transactions selected out of a pool of the same feePerKb set. I /think/ creating the heap with a tie-breaking mechanism of eg. the transaction hash should fix the issue, but it would need testing/more digging to confirm.\n",

Moreover, time will not change on one node which makes for least amount of change per node in which transactions are selected.\n\nhash based selection increases the churn in template changes per node significantly, which actually complicates compression in a distributed setup. To inject the same level of churn in first come based policy the spammer would need to find another priority rule such as increasing the fee.\n\nalso time of arrival selection is very easy to explain and predict when explaining how equal fee transactions gets selected for block inclusion.\n\nand time of arrivali is already a major factor in bitcoin network decisions, both in block chain consensus and relaying policy both of which uses first seen policy.\n\nNote: Imho there is very little need for a more precise consensus on next block content across the network. It would help centrally managed next-block compression algorithms, but I don't see much benefit in any other context.\n",

      "body": "Regarding first seen not differing: this is true unless someone is trying to make them differ. Its rather trivial to make many nodes differ entirely if your tie-breaker is first-seen. Considering that, in a healthy fee market environment, there will always be new transactions with a fee that causes new work to be required to match the filter, I'm not too concerned with churn causing poor filter matches. Remember such a metric is really only to make such systems work in the face of an attacker who is deliberately breaking them.\n\nRegarding the need for such a system: it isnt just about centralized systems. It makes just as much sense in a decentralized one as well, if that one has a need for mempool syncing to compress blocks (all current block compression protocols have this requirement). In a decentralized one, you would need to sync your mempool-discard-transaction-selection to use the same metric.\n",

      "body": "As a miner I prefer contents of my templates to be predictable and easy to explain, using first come first served with fee as priority is a very natural rule.\n\nI do not care much for the spam transactions, but I do care that block content selection makes sense to users.\n\nI don't see templates being somewhat different in the long tail across the network as a huge problem for compression. It is a problem for the current relay node block compression algorithm, but that is only because it is compressing based on the contents of a single mempool.\n\nThe number of miners is fairly limited and I do not expect any of them to have a problem to carry compression dictionaries for the next 5-10 expected blocks of each significant miner, even if all of them carry a different subset of low priority \"spam\" transactions in the tail of their blocks. We all have mostly  the same transactions in our mempools, and only ordering differ somewhat. For an attacker to make a noticeable problem for a distributed compression he would need to find fast paths into many miners, being able to carefully control their mempool contents. Just doing the attack on 3-4 paths in the network is not very significant from a distributed compression ratio perspective.\n\nadditionally the \"split view\" across the network exists no matter what same-fee ordering priority is used as the same can be accomplished with doublespend transactions.\n",
