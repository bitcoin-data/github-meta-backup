    "body": "I have in the past set bounties for a few issues, just in the title of the thread.  This doesn't work very well, because there is no (central) way for a developer to search for the bounty, or keep track of them.\r\n\r\n@Bosch-0 brough up https://bitcoinbounties.org/ but I'm not sure if we want to rely on a third party site, that lists other projects.\r\n\r\nI thought maybe a new label for bounties could be a good idea.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke wasn't sure this was a good solution, and brought up [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21071#issuecomment-1095005372) that we should discuss possible solutions in a separate issue.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?",

At best they could serve as a distraction from already identified long term priorities of a particular contributor/reviewer. At worst disagreements over who deserves the bounties after a PR is merged are discussed in this repo or pressure is exerted to merge prematurely to claim a particular bounty.\r\n\r\nAlthough anyone is free to prioritize their work based on bounties (I have no problem with bounties if managed externally to this repo especially if it encourages more external contributions) there seems to be more than enough funding available these days for an existing contributor to focus on their long term priorities and not have their priorities swayed by bounties.\r\n\r\n",
