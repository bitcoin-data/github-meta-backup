I would have retrieved it much faster from bittorrent\n",

Bitcoin Core verifies simultaneously with downloading, avoiding the need for double storage and needing to wait for the download to complete before starting to validate. That verification can be sped up a lot if you can assign more memory to the database cache as @jonasschelli mentioned.\n\n10 days does sound extremely long though.

Anyway, that's not important, my hw is a normal windaube PC, 5 years old CPU, 3Go\n\nFor some [research/project](https://github.com/Ayms/node-Tor#convergence) purposes  I must behave like a normal user, ie I have plenty of means to retrieve the blocklist more efficiently if I like, but here I am trying to act just like a normal user, and again the intent here is not to criticize things but to understand why they are like this and if possible to improve them, 10 days for (only) 80 GB + all checks, that's not possible, something is wrong\n\n> Again: the speed is dominated by how fast you can verify the blocks, not how fast you can download them. \n\nYou cannot speculate on the user processing capabilities/bandwidth, ie if I have a 100 Mbps bandwidth with high CPU/RAM then in this model the 8 peers scenario remains a very very serious limitation, it's impossible to pretend being faster than bittorrent with this\n\nAnd if I can download faster than checking the blocks then there are no reasons to block this\n\n> Bitcoin Core verifies simultaneously with downloading, avoiding the need for double storage and needing to wait for the download to complete before starting to validate\n\nYou can torrent the blockchain and check the blocks simultaneously too, for bitcoin you would need some luck to get contiguous pieces but modern bittorrent clients implement streaming which means that pieces are retrieved somewhere sequentially (not exactly but if some next pieces are required urgently the algorithm will retrieve them first)\n\nFor now I don't know why 30mn when you open bitcoin core to reverify the blockchain becomes 3 or 10 days when you download it (??)\n\nProbably it has already been thought in the past but it does not seem unlikely to envision a bittorrent client with bitcoin client where the blockchain is distributed in several trusted/verifiable infohashes (and seeded by both bt/btc) and does not need to be rechecked, and where the DHT can help storing information to unload the blockchain\n",

I would very much like to know what hardware you're running on (CPU, memory, disk, software version), and perhaps debug.log files. Perhaps a particular attack exists on the network that managed to interfere with your download process. Perhaps there is a bug in the download logic. But I can't judge that without seeing more information. What I can tell you is that downloading is generally not the issue - validation is, and a torrent won't help.\n\n> You cannot speculate on the user processing capabilities/bandwidth, ie if I have a 100 Mbps bandwidth with high CPU/RAM then in this model the 8 peers scenario remains a very very serious limitation, it's impossible to pretend being faster than bittorrent with this\n\nThe fastest numbers I know are possible with good connection, lots of memory, fast disk, many fast CPU cores, is around 4 hours for validating the entire chain. That's approximately 47 Mbit/s of block validation. More common on regular hardware is around 10 Mbit/s. Your 100 Mbit/s is not every going to matter - all you need is to be able to satisfy the demand of that 10 Mbit/s. With slow hardware and little memory, it can certainly drop much lower.\n\n> For now I don't know why 30mn when you open bitcoin core to reverify the blockchain becomes 3 or 10 days when you download it (??)\n\nWhat does 30mn mean?\n\n> Probably it has already been thought in the past but it does not seem unlikely to envision a bittorrent client with bitcoin client where the blockchain is distributed in several trusted/verifiable infohashes (and seeded by both bt/btc) and does not need to be rechecked, and where the DHT can help storing information to unload the blockchain\n\nWe used to maintain a blockchain torrent until 0.9, but it was discontinued in 0.10 for the reasons mentioned. With a torrent you'd have to wait until the majority of the chain arrived, as we can only validate linearly.\n",

I suppose this has already been studied/discussed\n",

However, we do not download blocks more than\n1000 (approximately one week worth) ahead of the latest fully validated\none, to make sure we don't stall full validation for too long. Furthermore,\nwe automatically select the best peers by continuously kicking off the\nslower ones. This mechanism seems to work very well in practice.\n\nThe expensive part of validation can only be done when you have the unspent\noutputs the transactions in that block depend on. Those are kept in a\ndatabase called the chainstate, and it depends on all previous blocks. It's\na reasonable suggestion to say we should do validation as soon as possible,\nbut please research how things work first.\n\nTo summarize:\n- If you want us to help investigate why synchronizing took 10 days, we\n  will need to know exactly what hardware and software you were using.\n  Getting the contents of debug.log would be even more useful.\n- If you want to throw out suggestions on how to improve the downloading\n  and validation, I really need to ask you to study how things work already.\n  We can't have a productive discussion otherwise.\n",

It might be better to have specific models from you, but I think I know where that will go (it's too old, & is that 3Gb of RAM?)\n\nI used to have some luck avoiding the initial checks with `-checkblocks`, but I see the default setting has changed since I used it last (used to do 240, it's now 6). `-checklevel` might also help.\n\nMaybe mention what version version you're running? If it's not a signed release, what git revision?\n",

Surely if someone has the checksum of the data, and trusts this checksum, then this should be all that is required.\n\nTo put this in perspective, when downloading Bitcoin-QT, you expect downloaders to trust the checksum which has been signed by various developers. In the same way, a checksum should be all that is required to download the blockchain also. No further validation should be needed, based on the same level of trust.\n\nI am proposing that the hash of the latest block can be that checksum for the entire blockchain, and that if enough trusted sources agree on that hash, then it's overkill to do more. This is afterall, the same degree of security being used for the propagation of the bitcoin-qt binaries.\n\nAnd please, less of the \"this is not the place\" comments.

      "body": "@sipa I do not think you are expecting everyone to check every line of code. I think, given the way bitcoin binaries are distributed, that you are expecting people to trust the people who have signed the gitian compiled code. Therefore given trust is already being expected, we're just talking about extending it to another area that is also exploitable (by those trusted). i.e. anything trusted could be used to steal bitcoins, so the security is not weakened in any way, given that the trust is already being given. People can still chose whether or not to trust - trust should be optional. But it's already an option for the code - make it an option for the blockchain too.\n\nThere are already many places where people can check the latest block height, hash, etc. Perhaps even the outbound connections the average node makes (once addrman is fixed) would be sufficient validation to be sure that the correct checksum/hash is obtained - the user could be invited to make a manual further check - perhaps checking one or more of the numerous websites out there that publishes the latest block height and hash. I think most full-node operators would be comfortable doing this.\n",

I clarified that block validation is much more than just checking hashes, which lead us on a tangent where you start elaborating that people trust the code anyway so it doesn't matter. Of course, if you're not going to validate, then whatever Jonas was talking about does not matter anymore, right? In particular:\n\n> Perhaps even the outbound connections the average node makes (once addrman is fixed) would be sufficient validation to be sure that the correct checksum/hash is obtained\n\nmakes me think you shouldn't touch Bitcoin with a 10-foot pole. Your suggestion would allow anyone who can sybil attack you (your ISP? state level entities? anyone with enough resources to mount an eclipse attack?) to print money at will, doublespend at will, and pretend to have paid you any amount.\n\nElsewhere you stated it should be optional, and operators could check the end result on a website. I expect this would result in a world where in practice nearly everyone would trust the same few websites, creating a huge systemic risk.\n\nMaybe you were talking about the idea of not verifying blocks coming from trusted nodes? I can't follow anymore. In any case, that doesn't actually gain you much, as you'd still need to build the chainstate (which is a large part of the sync time on modern CPUs), even if you don't validate the scripts in it.\n\nPlease, use appropriate places and tone for discussions. A github issue about torrent-like downloading is not the right place to discuss\nfundamentally changing Bitcoin's security model - you only reach a few developers that way. And I think there are much more inviting ways to ask for clarification about this issue than \"Surely it should be enough to verify the the block hashes are correct\".\n",

I do not consider this conversation to have gone out of scope, so am confused why this issue has been closed as I feel headway is being made with regards to finding a solution to this issue.\n\n@sipa I am unfamiliar with how the chainstate and UTXO would be created following the download of the blockchain - I am guessing that these would need to be reconstructed before the wallet functionality and ability to validate TXs became available, yes? Is there any way these could be shared between nodes in a way that reduced the work needed to construct them? Is there any documentation I can read that explains the structure/format of the chainstate and UTXO please?\n",
