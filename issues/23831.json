    "title": "[RFC] Stop automatically creating legacy and p2sh-segwit descriptors",
    "body": "As we see segwit and taproot usage grow, it seems reasonable to stop making wallets that are able to generate legacy and p2sh-segwit addresses. We have already made it difficult to make legacy addresses through the GUI (starting with `-addresstype=legacy` is the only way). The default address type is bech32. So it seems that we should consider stop automatically generating legacy, and probably p2sh-segwit, descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis would simply be removing the automatic creation of descriptors for the `LEGACY` and `P2SH_SEGWIT` output types for new wallets. We would still retain the ability to spend those outputs, parse those descriptors, and make those types of addresses if the user's wallet has descriptors for these output types. Additionally, if a user wanted to add such a descriptor to their wallet, they could via `importdescriptors`. There can also be some RPC which can add an automatically generated single key descriptor of whatever type that could legacy and p2sh-segwit descriptors to the wallet. Such an RPC would be the generic version of the one that will add `tr` descriptors (or perhaps the same RPC).",

I have good experience of working with C++ as my project in Google Summer of Code 2021 was totally based on C++. I also have good experience of python development. As the skillset required for the project `Remove Automatic Creation of Legacy Descriptors` matches mine, I am very much eager to participate in the Summer of Bitcoin working on this project.\r\n\r\nAs per the competency test, I shall build the project and let you know soon. It will really help me a lot if you could let me know of any prerequisites or any other instructions important for the project. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to a great summer ahead.",

I'm not trying to force anything onto the network or \"be dictators\". I'm not saying that this will affect users who do not use Bitcoin Core. The purpose is to improve the user experience for users of the wallet, and that includes not storing data that will likely never be used, and also making it harder to have to spend more money unintentionally.\r\n\r\nEven so, this suggestion does not mean that legacy addresses will be completely unsupported in the wallet. Anyone who has a legacy address descriptor will still be able to make legacy addresses. If you want legacy addresses and the wallet does not have such a descriptor, one can be imported using `importdescriptors`. After #25907, the process for adding such a descriptor will also become much easier.",

Bitcoin Core Wallet is the not the main wallet used for all transactions.\r\n> > Are you trying to police what people do with their transactions when segwit and taproot was a soft fork OPTIN?\r\n> > This will only affect how core wallet works not bitcoin.\r\n> \r\n> I think you misunderstand the purpose of this suggestion. I'm not trying to force anything onto the network or \"be dictators\". I'm not saying that this will affect users who do not use Bitcoin Core. The purpose is to improve the user experience for users of the wallet, and that includes not storing data that will likely never be used, and also making it harder to have to spend more money unintentionally.\r\n> \r\n> Even so, this suggestion does not mean that legacy addresses will be completely unsupported in the wallet. Anyone who has a legacy address descriptor will still be able to make legacy addresses. If you want legacy addresses and the wallet does not have such a descriptor, one can be imported using `importdescriptors`. After #25907, the process for adding such a descriptor will also become much easier.\r\n\r\nI agree with you and sorry for misunderstanding. Go ahead, I already love PSBT created by you however its not easy and we need to look at privacy, security, ui,ux, etc.",

We would still retain the ability to spend those outputs, parse those descriptors, and make those types of addresses if the user's wallet has descriptors for these output types.\r\n\r\n_This would simply be removing the automatic creation of descriptors for the LEGACY and P2SH_SEGWIT_\r\n\r\nThis is not required. This is what I don't like and care about the issues so I am commenting. And there is nothing wrong with allowing users to create wallets with all types of descriptors. I do not agree with the opinion that this will help in efficient block usage.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is not an efficient financial network, its censorship resistant network where users should be allowed to do what they want. They could still import descriptors but default matters and affects the way people use core right now.",
