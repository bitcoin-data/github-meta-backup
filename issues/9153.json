    "body": "\r\nI installed electrum ,  it has not asked me for the password  it has not shown me the seed. \r\nI think that this has happened because probably the electum wallet during the new installation has recovered data from an old installation.    \r\nUnfortunately I have not been paying attention to this,   the wallet was  activated immediately and i send bitcoin to it from a bitcoin core wallet.  ,......       Now my bitcoin are in the electrum wallet  installed on my PC and I do not have the password and e seed. \r\nhow can I recover  the bitcoins?    people say that those bitcoin are lost but I can't belive it....they are in my wallet installed in my pc.......\r\nCan you help me please.......?\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you in advance\r\n\r\n",
