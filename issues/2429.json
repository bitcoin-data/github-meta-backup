    "body": "Providing a stack list of past receive addresses as a top level GUI element encourages reuse, it makes addresses seem like something scarce which should be conserved. It also can result in people accidentally sending coins to addresses created prior to wallet encryption.\n\nThe interface should probably be adjusted to make it clear that used addresses are used and shouldn't be reused, e.g. by only displaying the initial digits of all but the most recent address and requiring context click to get details.\n",

They can be marked \"used\" when an address has received a payment (to discourage multiple payments and reduce the balance-containing addresses with their pubkeys previously broadcast).\n\nThe text \"You may want to give a different one to each sender...\" -> \"you should give out a new address for each payment you wish to receive.\"\n",

Similar to what is now the QR code dialog. A workflow of \n\n1) fill in label\n2) fill in amount (optional)\n3) click \"Make payment request\"\n4) show  the new receiving address that can be copy/pasted as well as a QR code and Bitcoin: URI\n\nIt is then made clear to the user that he should give this address to the person that wants to send him coins. \n\nListing the current receiving addresses is secondary; it could remain at the bottom of the tab, or behind a special menu item.\n",
