    "body": "Have you guys ever considered a threadpool to verify mempool verifications to decrease latency of tx's propogated across the network? Obviously the biggest hurdle is the DDOS vector from invalid signatures but do you think there is a way around that through some sort of rate-limiting approach or something more clever possibly to detect and manage stray/invalid signature verification requests?\r\n\r\nWith the multi-core CPUs and highly optimized secp256k1 it may allow us to scale throughput drastically if it were possible, just a thought!",

In my case I am investigating to increase this throughput through multi-core. I have a proof of concept which works and is 2x-3x faster because it relays in parallel and bans if invalid sig. However obviously this won't work in a production environment because of the attacks so I thought I'd brainstorm with you guys!",
