    "body": "At the time of writing approximately [86.51%](http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/security.html?201817144) of the Bitcoin network is vulnerable to [CVE-20181-7144.](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/) It has been two weeks since 0.16.3 was tagged with the vulnerability fix.  \r\n\r\nI believe the occasional [breaking of user space](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25954270/what-does-it-mean-to-break-user-space) is one of the contributing factor to this situation where things can be improved. I believe marking an RPC method deprecated and removing it within a few new releases may not be sufficient, since most developers do not code directly against Bitcoin Core, rather they take an RPC client implementation, written by someone else in their respective programming language. These projects tend to be unmaintained, incomplete, and sometimes even buggy.  \r\nThese developers, in such an environment may consider upgrading their Core nodes to be too risky.\r\n\r\nI know it is hard living together with legacy code and immature API design decisions, but a \"never break the user space\" policy may result in a more secure and stable environment.",

      "body": "This is rather reaching. An astonishingly few amount of nodes are used for rpc purposes, and even fewer of those are going to be in a position where they can't easily upgrade. Their contribution to the amount of vulnerable nodes is negligible at best.\r\n\r\nA much directer way of supporting the goal of having users patch their nodes quickly would be to have had the patch back-ported for previous releases much faster.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do think core is a bit aggressive in how they deprecate stuff (and require using a deprecated flag) which makes upgrading a bit more painful than it should be.  And I have been bitten really badly by some instability before (namely changes in the edge-cases of ListSinceBlock which broke my application about 3 times) to the point I had to stop even using it.  However, I would argue a lot of that pain is caused by poor documentation  (some stuff literally has no documentation of what it should do so it's anyones guess what is correct behavior) and a lack of tests (to catch changes/regressions) and ultimately a lack of developers.\r\n\r\nI think increasing the maintenance burden by imposing a \"never break user space\" will just strictly make things worse.",

I introduced the `deprecatedrpc` flag in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11031. The idea is that downstream users have at least one release where both the old API and new API are valid. To use the old API, the user *must* take action (enable the flag). That means they can't not be aware that the old API is being deprecated in the next version. The alternative would be just to have a written warning, which could easily be missed by users.\r\n\r\nIs the `deprecatedrpc` burdensome for users? If so, do you have a suggestion for a better way to deprecate old APIs?",

      "body": "@jnewbery I understand the theory, it's just that in practice it's kind of painful\r\n\r\nTaking a recent example, I just [published a little program](https://github.com/rhavar/bustapay) which uses `signrawtransaction`. But that's been deprecated and effectively renamed to `signrawtransactionwithwallet` in 0.17.\r\n\r\nOk, cool, I'm aware of that. So what should I do? Use the `signrawtransactionwithwallet` but now it has a hard dependency on 0.17. Or should I continue to use `signrawtransaction` but require running with `-deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction` in 0.17 ?  This is a problem that all the bindings need to deal with too now, and there's no good solution (unless you expect them to do \"feature detection\" and dynamically switch between the two, but at that point it raises that question of was is _really_ worth creating all that complexity for applications, just so you're sure they're aware of your deprecation schedule?) .\r\n\r\nThe fact is this sort of deprecation stops allowing smooth upgrades, and honestly -- I don't think you can justify it the aggressiveness of it. It's my experience that a WARN_ONCE style deprecation system is vastly superior and smoother. Yes, it's easier to ignore -- but those people will end up hurting themselves -- for everyone else, everything just goes smoother.\r\n\r\nAnd probably more importantly: if the system uses deprecation warnings I can just do the upgrade, and then migrate away from the deprecated methods at my leisure. While with the deprecated-method-hidden-behind-a-flag system, I need to *upfront* know exactly which rpc methods my application is using (which might not be obvious or easy to find, especially so if I'm using libraries/code I didn't write myself) and most likely pressured into doing a more complex simultaneous release of my code + bitcoin-core as no one likes turning on deprecated flags :P\r\n\r\nI also think deprecation schedule can be slower unless there's some tangible benefit for it (e.g. cleaning up the code to make it easier to work with). An aggressive schedule for renaming `signrawtransaction` to `signrawtransactionwithwallet` seems a bit overzealous.\r\n\r\n(And I do think this stuff benefits by a more case-by-case analysis, some stuff can't go fast enough for sure)",

It's pretty easy to see by looking at bitcoin bindings, and seeing they pretty much all break now with the upgrade to 0.17. \r\n\r\nI don't like to complain too loudly about this stuff, as I know it's all volunteer driven and I'm certainly not volunteering. But a less painful deprecation schedule for would make things go smoother, especially when there's no maintenance burden on core for leaving it in for a while. (e.g. something like `signrawtransaction` is probably not very burdensome to be left in, so I think should be deprecated a lot slower than something that's actually causing pain).\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nA bit of a shower-thought, but instead hiding stuff behind deprecated-flag -- it'd could be nicer to have something like a deprecated use log. The first time you use a deprecated features, it appends to the log. \r\n\r\nThen on startup the software warns about the deprecated shit you've been using, and if any of them have since been removed it gives an error (until the person clears the deprecated log).",

No, I don't think the \"slow\" adoption of a new release has anything to do with breaking changes (I doubt any significant percentage of nodes are used via RPC at all, and for those that do, we have backports).

      "body": "> This is a problem that all the bindings need to deal with too now, and there's no good solution (unless you expect them to do \"feature detection\" and dynamically switch between the two, but at that point it raises that question of was is really worth creating all that complexity for applications, just so you're sure they're aware of your deprecation schedule?) .\r\n\r\nYes, this is a breaking API change. The client does need to know about it. The `deprecatedrpc` just means that you get an extra release as warning. Whether it happens in 0.17 or 0.18, your client will need to change behaviour based on server version.\r\n\r\n> I also think deprecation schedule can be slower unless there's some tangible benefit for it (e.g. cleaning up the code to make it easier to work with). An aggressive schedule for renaming signrawtransaction to signrawtransactionwithwallet seems a bit overzealous.\r\n\r\nThe API isn't changed simply because developers like breaking the API for users. There was very tangible benefit to breaking `signrawtransaction` into wallet and non-wallet methods. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10570 for rationale. It was also part of a larger effort to remove the circular dependencies between server and wallet (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7965). This was long-term technical debt inherited from V0.1 when wallet and node code were completely mixed up main.cpp.\r\n\r\nPlease believe me that developers take API stability very seriously (eg count the uses of `IsDeprecatedRPCEnabled()` in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.17/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp for logic added to support the accounts API while users transition to the labels API, or the tests in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.17/test/functional/rpc_deprecated.py and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.17/test/functional/wallet_labels.py). However, that consideration needs to be weighed against the benefits to all users when we pay down technical debt and make the product more secure and maintainable.\r\n\r\n>> There's been a long time it's been overly cautious with RPC API changes, in some cases for years—like with getinfo.\r\n\r\n> I guess it's not often someone one says \"good job\", but that's really a great example of where (from an external perspective) it was done really well, and allowed for a really smooth transition.\r\n\r\nI disagree. This was not a good job. Supporting legacy APIs for many years that prevent us from doing useful work like separating wallet from node hurts the security of all users. And even if we take years to remove a legacy API we still get complaints (eg https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11671).\r\n\r\n> Maybe it's going too fast now, but I expect this to be a moment of temporary breakage, as there is a lot going on—such as the change to multi-wallet, which necessitates some RPC changes to keep sanity.\r\n\r\nYes - I've been aggressive in removing legacy code and paying down technical debt over the last couple of releases. Much of this technical debt goes back to v0.1. In the short term it may be painful for a small subset of users, but in the long run everyone benefits.",

This is true for all software without automatic update system (and we very intentionally don't have that).\n\nAlso, it doesn't necessarily matter. We can't actually observe what percentage of economically relevant nodes has updated. I believe (but this is just a guess, and I have no strong evidence) that among the number of nodes that are actually used (through RPC or otherwise indirectly affecting validation of transactions that are economically relevant to the owner), the percentage of upgraded nodes is much higher.\n\nPlease. There is a time and place to discuss backward compatibility, but can you not turn into a drama? The rate of upgrading is completely expected. In fact, I think it's much better now than it was years ago, when breaking changes were far more rare.",
