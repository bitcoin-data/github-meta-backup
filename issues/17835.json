    "body": "Since version bitcoin-core-0.19.0.1 the `bitcoin-cli getblock <hash> 2` command does not produce lists of addresses in tx, vout. It works fine in bitcoin-core-0.18.1.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nVerbose level json returned by bitcoin-cli getblock command for a given block hash should print a list of addresses in tx, vout.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nFor each tx, vout: reqSigs and addresses are missing\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli getblockhash 0\r\n000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\r\nbitcoin-cli getblock \"000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\" 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\nUbuntu 18.04.3 LTS x86_64, 4.15.0-72-generic, bash 4.4.20, Intel i5-8500B (4) @ 2.999GHz (virtual machine on VirtualBox 1.2). Tested: bitcoin-core-0.19.0.1, bitcoin-core-0.18.1, bitcoin-core-0.18.0.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\nbitcoin-core-0.18.1 see [https://pastebin.com/pQApzMCK](https://pastebin.com/pQApzMCK) (tx, vout contains addresses array)\r\nbitcoin-core-0.19.0.1 see [https://pastebin.com/JsDP6kqQ](https://pastebin.com/JsDP6kqQ) (addresses are not present)\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\nI only checked a few old blocks (such as genesis block in examples above), I cannot confirm this is also the problem with the recent blocks (maybe for some reason it just doesn't work only with P2PK but it works fine with P2PKH?).\r\n\r\nIf this is by design please point me to the appropriate change documentation, I couldn't find any clear indication of addresses list removal from the command output.",
