    "body": "The close button of the command line options window doesn't seem to work with Bitcoin-Qt 0.7.0 (and with a tarball from github I compiled a few days ago) on Ubuntu Lucid and Precise amd64. It simply has no effect at all. The issue is very easy to reproduce: just click Help > Debug Window > Command line options and you'll get the following window: ![Bitcoin command line options window](http://ompldr.org/vZnRvcQ/Bitcoin_command_line_window.gif)\n\nThen try to close the button by clicking on the usual \"X\" button. Only the OK button closes that window.\n\nAs as side remark, note that currently the \"OK\" and \"Show/Hide Details\" buttons do not seem to have i18n support. They are displayed in English with languages translated at 100% on Transifex. It may also be useful to give users the possibility to resize that window so that the listed options can be read more easily.\n",

      "body": "> I tested this with official 0.7.0 release and on Windows 7 x64 the \"X\" button, is greyed out and not usable for me.\n\nProbably a glitch with Qt on Unix-like systems side then. I was using GNOME 2.30.2 on Lucid and MATE 1.4 on Precise on which the screen shot was taken. Anyway, it's just window cosmetics so not a big deal, really.\n\n> It is rather clear what the button is intended for, I see no need to remove it, as it should be helpful at first for all\n> Windows users, which are not that familiar with command-line fiddling ;).\n\n+1. That's how once I learnt about command line options in general so IMHO it makes sense to keep it (on GNU/Linux too). Even more so as copying & pasting its content works fine. Sure, you'll get questions but some people will also learn about these options.\n\n> I'm sorry for the effort you put into reporting this issue but I have to close this with \"WONTFIX\".\n\nIn fact I thought devs had forgotten to polish that window so wanted to bring it to your attention, just in case. But no problem if Qt's limitations prevent that polishing: it's already good enough and helpful as it is, so thanks for replying and keep coding for us :p\n",
