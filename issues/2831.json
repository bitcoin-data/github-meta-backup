    "body": "I'm using v0.8.3 and issuing the backupwallet command via the QT GU works, but that performs a local backup.\n\nUsing the JSON-RPC to a bitcoind server via 127.0.0.1 or remote IP always causes the server to return 500 Internal Server Error, additionally it does not return any JSON error codes as per bitcoin/bitcoin#1908\n\nThis is a documented function and I would it expect the path or path/filename to refer to a filespec on the remote server when using the RPC interface.\n\nIts critical tp me to be able to backup your wallet via RPC.\n",
