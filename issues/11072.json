    "body": "Is it possible to replace token-generating method [base58](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/base58.h) to [base62x](https://github.com/wadelau/Base62x) in the bitcoin repository?\r\nAs it stated in base58.h, \r\n\r\n>   Why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?\r\n>   - Don't want 0OIl characters that look the same in some fonts and\r\n>      could be used to create visually identical looking data.\r\n>  - A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as input.\r\n>  - E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break at.\r\n>  - Double-clicking selects the whole string as one word if it's all alphanumeric.\r\n\r\n[base62x](https://github.com/wadelau/Base62x) meets all of these reqirements and its has ***some shorter representation*** due to higher number base, i.e., 58 --> 64.\r\n\r\nExcept that there are 0OIl in the representation, however it is quite rare for users of bitcoin to write or read those token by human, instead all of tokens input and output by machine, i.e., copy and paste in most of cases and environments.\r\n\r\nAnd one more plus for [base62x](https://github.com/wadelau/Base62x), it might ***calculate faster*** than base58 because its bitwise operations over that of base58 with arithmetic methods.\r\n\r\nWhat others should be put under consideration for this switch?\r\n \r\n",
