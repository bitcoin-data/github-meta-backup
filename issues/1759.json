Subsequent attempts to run Bitcoin result in it failing at loading the blkindex.dat file.\n5. Uninstalling/Reinstalling with either Windows or Bitcoin's uninstaller does not fix the issue.\n\nFirst time user...not exactly made confident by this initial exposure/failure.\n\nNot sure this is technically a bug, but it surely cannot be a feature.\n\nPlease assist...and thank you,\n\nBB\n",

I do actually have a tiny amount of coin in the wallet which I would be just as happy to keep as to lose (as I suspect would be the case for most users regardless of circumstance), so exactly which files in which directories need to be deleted or fixed or whatever...it that is the correct solution? For example, I don't see a \"data\" directory for Bitcoin. I see \"daemon\" and \"src\"...\n\nPlease understand that I am simply an end-user...just like most any other person in-the-wild who might like to see what this is about...and thanks for your help.\n",

Little we can do about that while using BDB (the database engine) I'm afraid, but it is embarrassing to be frank. BDB should deal with such events, but since it didn't, I fear there's little you can do but delete blkindex.dat, blk0001.dat, and if it exists blk0002.dat. They can be found in the data directory (see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory). After that, start Bitcoin again, and it should redownload the blockchain.\n",

Hope you understand...\n\n@sipa Bitcoin is running again and downloading the block chain according to your suggestion...so thank you very kindly. I'll play around with it a bit, but given this first-time experience I can't imagine trying to rely on Bitcoin as a way to actually live and make routine transactions. It's desperately...D-E-S-P-E-R-A-T-E-L-Y...needed...but it simply can't fly like this in my opinion...it just can't gain widespread use.\n\nReally...thinking about it just now, wouldn't it have to be essentially foolproof for children as young as four or five...or whatever age it is that kids commonly start to handle small amounts of paper and coin money?\n\nMuch appreciation for the concept though...cheers and well wishes!\n",
