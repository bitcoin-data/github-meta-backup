    "body": "**Expected behavior**: Disabling DNS seeding (`-dnsseed=0`) should make Bitcoin Core use the fixed seed nodes immediately on startup (assuming an empty `peers.dat`).\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**:  The fixed seed nodes are used but only after an unnecessary 60 second timeout, and a somewhat misleading log message (\"Adding fixed seed nodes as DNS doesn't seem to be available.\").\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**: `rm ~/.bitcoin/peers.dat && src/bitcoind -dnsseed=0` and wait... ðŸ’¤ \r\n\r\nThis issue is probably a \"good first issue\" :)",
