    "body": "While bitcoin-qt is downloading the chain to synchronize with the network, opening the coin control dialog box makes the GUI unresponse with no notification to the user on what is occuring. This is duplicatable behavior for me, and gui lockup time varied from as high as a minute to as low as 8 second. As soon as the blockchain is syncronized, no gui lockup occurs.\n\nStep 1: Open up a Bitcoin Core wallet that is behind on synchronization. Mine was behind about 48 hours, giving me a few minutes to test before synchronization was complete.\n\nStep 2: Go to the Send tab, and in the Coin Control Features box click 'Inputs...'. The app will no become unresponsive for roughly 30 seconds and after some time the coin selection dialog will eventually appear.\n\nStep 3: Try to reproduce after blockchain is fully syncronized. Notice that no more delay is occurring.\n\nVerified on Bitcoin Core version v0.10.1 (64-bit) linux. \n\nTheory: Verifying incoming blocks is taking a lot of CPU. Pulling up the Coin Selection dialog may also take some CPU to construct the Tree of Transactions. (My wallet was very small with only a few entries, but non the less my gui was still locking up.) Perhaps the app can prioritize building the Coin Selection window for the user over any background processes that are verifying blocks. The Background block verifying should be a lower priority background thread, though i admit I know little about how threading works or if this is what is actually causing the issue.\n",

      "body": "I am noticing some other things which seem related to this issue, probably what @theuni was talking about with \"the current issue that slows down message processing while ActivateBestChain() is being run with lots of blocks to connect.\"\n\n1- Seem more likely to occur when I am further back in the chain. I am 2 days behind, and the slow down is substantial. I am seeing 'UpdateTip' constantly in the debug, about once per second. Why is it running over and over again?\n2- Other things are suspiciously slow as well. Though I have many connections to many peers (9), the blockchain download is going really slow. Looking at the bandwidth graph I am going through long periods of less then 10k throughput of block download with a few short bursts of 100k. Likewise, I am noticing the client still says '2 days behind' for a long time. I am having no connectivity issues.\n3- Suddenly my client is all caught up. It went from '2 days behind' to 'Up to date' very quickly. Is it possible that all the blocks were downloaded, but the lag was just in verifying them locally?\n4- I noticed in the gui debug window, the Peers tab, that querying agent information from the peers was no visible and apparently bottle necked as well.\n\nIs there another bug filed for the 'ActivateBestChain' issue?\n",
