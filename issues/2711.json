      "body": "@whitslack You are technically correct. Transactions have inputs, and inputs refer to previous outputs, and those outputs have in the majority of cases a well-defined address. You can call this a \"from address\" if you like, and it is well-defined. The reason for not calling it that way is because people make incorrect assumptions about it. People associate certain properties with a \"from address\", like that it belongs to the sender of the transaction (not true in case of online wallets), that you can send coins back to it (not true in case of shared wallets), or that it is unique or always present. Furthermore, it makes people think Bitcoin works as a ledger with address balances.\n\nMore in the context of this issue: the problem is that it breaks the abstraction provided by the wallet software (which is: a wallet has a balance, and has several address to receive coins with, but otherwise functions as a black box). Not everyone needs this abstraction, but just breaking it partially will even cause more confusion.\n\nMy preferred solution is coin control - not because I think it's that useful as a feature for most (micro-management is IMHO not how you solve a privacy issue, the software should offer higher-level solutions for that like multiple independent wallets and linking-minimizing transaction creation), but because it breaks the abstraction completely and allows you to see the wallet as a set of coins, assigned to addresses. This indeed does what you want, but without risking the misunderstanding that it's addresses that are used as inputs.\n",
