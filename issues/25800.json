Other connections are added to the list (the UPnP discovery occurs, other peers are also discovered), but will never start.

I've also seen in Bitcoin.io that v23 nodes seem now to be frequently stalling near the best tip. They apparently need to be regularly shut down and restarted to resync them.\r\n\r\nIn other words the logic for sync'ing nodes (even those that are not in IBD) is broken now in v23.",

      "body": "After (too many) tests, I just figured out what to do: STOPPING using the QT UI for the IBD.\r\n\r\nYou may use te QT Interface just to start and try the configuration, but for the IBD it is unreliable.\r\n\r\nThis bug seems to be caused by Qt's own internal threads for its UI, adding it own unsynchronized locks or managing other condurrent threads used by Bitcoin incorrectly, or it could be a bug in the Qt integration inside the BitCoin Core UI.\r\n\r\nAlso I note that bitcointd is much faster than bitcoin-qt to progress in the IBD phase.\r\n\r\nOnce the IBD phase is complete. you can interrupt bitcoind (CTRL+C is safe, and it terminates much faster), if you want to continue with the QT UI (which will not consume a lot of CPU/disk/net resources). However I've noted frequently that the QT version can corrupt some indexes. The Qt integrationis not completely thread safe and has race isues.\r\n\r\nIMHO, the QT version should run the daemon only in a separate process (which could be registered in Windows as a standard \"service\", without any attached console), and control it with its RPC/IPC interface. Stopping the QT interface should not stop the daemon, unless we click a button to stop the daemon by its RPC/IPC interface (or via Windows services API).\r\n\r\nAs well there should be an option to send logs not in a flat file, but to Windows Events, where they could be compressed and managed automatically with a circular buffer (internally Windows Events will be packed in *.evtx or *.etl files and have a type handler managing common strings and formaters): this also saves a lot of I/O; Windows provides tools to dump these events into a flat file if needed, and to also filter them by sources, event type IDs, or sort them in different order. This would be mostly useful for log events generated by the daemon (debug logs for the QT interface can remain in flat files, or could be sent to a different source category in Windows Events).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNote also that I use a dedicated storage partition only for the /Bitcoin data files and NOT the main system partition.\r\n\r\nI have also formatted it not with the default cluster sizes (4KB) but increased it to clusters of 256KB (because most files are very large): this significantly improves the I/O, reduces the filesystem overhead in terms of I/O and memory for the filesystem structures (allocation bitmaps are smaller and modified much less often, because database files, undo files, index files, redo-logs, and debug log files are all allocated incrementally and in parallel), it improves the filesystem cache, reduces the fragmentation a lot (when the store is on harddisks, even on a fast array), so we also get reduced latency.\r\n\r\nThis also greatly facilitates maintenance.",

      "body": "No, version 22.0 has the same issue (though it does not have the bug present in the EXE installer for Windows caused by ASLR, due to a bug in MAKENSIS which creates an invalid EXE by when it appends the \"pcode\" compiled from the nsis.ini script, and then appends the compressed files, because it does not correctly manages the relations that are placed after them, but forgets to update the PE EXE header to the new placement of the relocation section in the EXE file)\r\n\r\nv22 tools has the same issue with the IBD which stalls as well if you use the QT interface (in addition, the bitcoin-qt.exe also corrupts the indexes; Qt is unsafe as it silently changes some global settings in the C runtime environment, and the LevelDB is also affected; it seems that Qt temporarily changes the current working directory, and files accessed by LeevlDB do not seem to specify the absolute path, so there are race conditions where some Qt threads may affect concurrent LevelDB threads.\r\n\r\nIF you use only the CLI daemon (v22 or v23), there's no such conflict and race conditions; it is faster in both cases than their QT version; but the v23 includes many fixes (multiple ones being critical) still not present in the v22 binaries (and not backported in the v22 sources).\r\n\r\nI just hope that a new v23 will be recreated soon (and there are other bugs pending to be solved, already present in the sources, but not in the precompiled binaries).\r\n\r\nIn my opinon the QT version of the daemon has not been seriously tested. And trying to link the daemon with the QT interface is an error; the QT interface should spawn or control the regular CLI daemon",

      "body": "Also I've discovered that in some cases, during the IBD phase, if we have too many open connections with other peers, we exhaust the maximum number of allowed open files in the whole process.\r\nAs a result we get a status saying \"Error: Error reading from database, shutting down.\"\r\n\r\nBut what is worse is that during that shutdown, Bitcoind or Bitcoin-qt is unable to save its current indexing: it should first close all peer connections, make sure that they don't have threads open in existing LevelDB files or on block files, BEFORE finally saving the indexing state. This occurs much more often with the QT version probably beaue Qt itself uses many additional file handles.\r\n\r\nSo Bitcoin core is not properly handling cases where it cannot open files. If this occurs, an exception handler should first seek to terminate connections to peers with lower priority (notably incoming peers before outgoing peers).\r\n\r\nAs well there are visibly leaks of open file handles if we leave Bitcoin Core open for a long time, especially during the IBD phase. The work around for that is to run the IBD phase for a limited time (e.g. stop after half an hour). Bitcoin core should in fact make such cleanup, possibly closing all connections to peers regularly, flushing its indexing state.\r\n\r\nAs well it should NOT cleanup all files in the chainstate immediately, but should preserve at least the previous valid manifest and its attached lbd files. If ever there's been a corruption because it could not save the last chainstate, at least it has a way to restart from the previous manifest, and may be me more conservative by limiting the number of peers with which it interacts (for now there's no limit at all, and during the IBD, remote peers can request any data from anywhere, in any order, and this locks too many files, more that what is allowed in the configuration.\r\n\r\nBy default it accepts up to 125 peers, and about 2000 open files, but during the IBD and if you have multiple indexes in construction, that limit is easily exhausted (notably when you run it over a Gigabit  Internet connection): you cannot safely run the IBD phase and at the same time allow the construction of several additional indexes in parallel (e.g. with blockfilterindex=1, coinstatsindex=1, peerblockfilters=1, peerbloomfilters=1: you can only enable them one by one, after you'ev succesfully finished the IBD and each of the following phases for other indexes).\r\n\r\nSuch forced shutdown (which incorrectly states that the \"blocks are corrupted\", when in fact it could not even open them because of internal resource limits) leaving the chainstate after the shutdown in an inconsistant state (I've checked the blocks they were perfectly correct, it's just that Bitcoin Core could not open them!) and it is very harmful (because we've lost the chainstate which becomes unrecoverable and has to be reindexed once again from the begining) and as opposed to what is said, this has nothing to do with a hardware problem on the sorage or with the memory: it is architectural in the app, which does not use safe management of its own resources usage, even if the host can perfectly support more! The so called \"corruption\" is generated by Bitcoin Core itself by not properly tracking its own internal errors for its own resource usages, whose given diagnostics are wrong about their effective cause).\r\n\r\nAlso I wonder why, with the option \"reindex-chainstate\", Bitcoin core will not just run without accepting ANY incoming connections; it may just open 1 outgoing connection to a full peer, and it should be sufficient for the time needed to recover the chainstate to the last block.",

Or isn't Bitcoin Core v22+ itself misbehaving?\r\n\r\nNote that I have stopped since long trying to use the QT version (which bugs too much often). I just use the command line daemon (bitcoind) and the command line CLI query client (bitcoin-cli). In all cases these stalls or crashes are inside the management of the chainstate (there's no corruption at all in the downloaded blocks) occuring at random position (with the same valid blocks downloaded I can restart \"reindex-chainstate\", it always fails.\r\n\r\nIf I restart with \"reindex\" it forces downloading again the whole blocks, but when performing binary compares with a backup of blocks from previous runs, they are strictly identical (except \"block00000.dat\" which is special and contains the current root of the tree, updated at each run).\r\n\r\nI thought my PC was too fast, and my Gigabit figer internet too fast. I tried running the daemon in a Linux VM, by restricting its amount of memory and network bandwidth allocated in the hypervisor. Still I get the same results: It's never possible to terminate the IBD, I always get crashes by corruptions in the chainstate (some *.ldb files were deleted too early after a merge, even though they were still needed for other upper *.ldb files files; or I got the chainstate stalled as well in the IBD, and no corruption detected by the daemon).\r\n\r\nI don't know what kind of machine or specific configuration can really make Bitcoin Core working and succeed in their IBD phase.\r\n\r\nOr the Bitcoin chain already and really contains invalid blocks (that were rejected much longer after they were first accepted), that can't be eliminated and no progress is possible (in that case it is the whole shared Bitcoin chain which is damaged since long, or Bitcoin Core has forgotten to implement a rule to perform a safe cleanup of rejected blocks).\r\n\r\nAre there reliable Bitnode softwares **other than Bitnode Core v22+** that can be used today to run a full node with the current state of the chain?",

      "body": "And if you still think that my machine has a hardware problem, I've also tried on different PCs, and with a Linux VM hosted in Azure and Amazon. They are also failing to sync the IBD with the same symptoms in the \"chainstate\" (corruption of the chain with index *.lbd files deleted too soon, and missing, or stalling at unpredictable height).\r\n\r\nI think that those that have Bitcoin Core working on their machine had to compile it themselves. But they DO NOT use your signed binary releases (which aer most prbably not compiled correctly in a safe environment; I know you use a new build chain in \"GUIX\", but it is then not working at all: do you really test the generated binaries, which seem to be broken locally in GUIX by some unknown and unsafe/untested local customizations and patches, or running on a broken/damaged Linux installation?).\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that it is not my machines that are borken, but your \"GUIX\" environment used to produce the signed binaries. And unfortunately you've not opensourced that environment; may be you should retry by using an hypervisor like Proxmox and building a \"template\" for a safe Linux image, a safe installtion of GCC and related tools; that tempalte would then be easy to replicate when you want to make all your tests before actual releases. The sources of Bitcoin Core alone is definitely not sufficient without a safe build chain we can replicate easily. Apparently you are only testing Bitcoin core with binaries you compile on your local machines without using \"GUIX\", you never use or test the **released** signed binaries published on your official website!",

Are they caused by misbehaving nodes (or malwares) in the P2P network distributing wrong blocks and causing normal nodes in IBD to fail or stall? Is it the signal of an DoS attack again the Bitcoin chain in order to take control of it by \"ejecting\" regular nodes with such bad blocks? In that case, they are succesful in their attacks since many months! I've never been able to compleet the IBD from any machine when using Bitcoin Core. May be this is the sign that Bitcoin Core does not fully apply the \"consensus\" rules for validating new blocks, and that it accepts them too early, and is unable to rollback safely when they are detected as \"disapproved\" too much longer later. And above some limits (a big number of bad block in the chain to revert to replace one that came much earlier in the chain), it seems to crash and corrupt the \"chainstate\" index files itself.\r\n\r\nBut may be there are other competing softwares that could work such as https://www.bitcoinabc.org/ (if they've detected such attack and are able to isolate and fix it)?\r\n",

It's not synchronizing further, because it is treating every peer that hands it block 277177 as malicious. We'll need to figure out why that is happening. Your comment above about running out of file descriptors seems like a useful lead.\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to know if it is the block on disk itself that is corrupted, or the validation database. It's likely the latter, but to find out, run `reconsiderblock 0000000000000002cdf7bce4c09c0849f789a9508d812d3ca430429f6213688b`, and report what you see in debug.log at that time.\r\n\r\n> Do I need to manually delete some recent blk0*.dat and rev0*.dat and restart indexing again and again?\r\n\r\nIf the blocks themselves are corrupted, you'll need to use `-reindex`. If it's just the database that is corrupted, `-reindex-chainstate` should suffice. Given that it sounds like you've tried the latter several times and that doesn't help, it's either a problem with the blocks themselves, or somehow your Bitcoin Core instance is corrupting itself time after time. Looking at the `reconsiderblock` output will help figure this out.\r\n\r\n> Are they caused by misbehaving nodes (or malwares) in the P2P network distributing wrong blocks and causing normal nodes in IBD to fail or stall?\r\n\r\nMisbehaving nodes should never be able to cause Bitcoin Core to incorrectly mark a block as invalid, so no.\r\n\r\n> May be this is the sign that Bitcoin Core does not fully apply the \"consensus\" rules for validating new blocks, and that it accepts them too early\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n> But may be there are other competing softwares that could work such as https://www.bitcoinabc.org/ (if they've detected such attack and are able to isolate and fix it)?\r\n\r\nThat software is for a different currency, with different consensus rules.

      "body": "Could it be caused by some OS limitation (temporarily disabling write accesses for some critical operations, and sending a \"busy\" status error that Bitcoin Core does not corerctly interpret, and cannot recover just by a retry after some reasonnable delay; e.g. it could be generated by security tools, instructing a running app to \"pause\" temporarily and not allowing for example to create or delete new files in the directory containing files of the chainstate, which changes really too fast with thousands files added/deleted each minute)? It may be caused by the fact that even if we close a file handle, the OS may still maintain it internally for its own operations, and cannot allocate new file handles for some time, until the OS performs some background cleanup in the background with the filesystem.\r\n\r\nSo the issue would be that Bitcoin core fails while trying to open a new file: the OS does not accept immediately to give it a new file handle, and the error returned may indicate that the application needs to wait a bit before retrying.",

      "body": "It's true that I've never seen any LevelDB application creating and deleting so many indexes at such incredible rate. Generally these indexes are quite stable, they just grow slowly in size.\r\nMay be the maximum index sizes for each table is too small (2MB) for a fast machine, and we easily reach the limitation of the OS for the filesystem background operations that are likely starting as soon as we close the file (and LevelDB doesnot seem to \"sync\" the filesystem when it closes a file, it allwos the OS to perform background cleanup, but the file handle remains allocated for the process as long as the OS has not terminated those operations.\r\n\r\nDoes LevelDB uses some optimized operations that allow file close to return instantly without waiting the effective completion? such optimization does not seem to be very \"safe\". The \"close()\" operation (or delete/move/rename operation) should be blocking.\r\n\r\nBut visibly LevelDB seems to use worker threads to complete its file I/O like ni this project (using the Go language)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/blob/master/leveldb/storage/file_storage.go\r\n\r\nLevelDB creates an increadible amount of threads if I monitor Bitcoin Core and just look at them, and the total number of file handles that are open (they are frequently \"spiking\" very high, notably when performing \"gettxoutsetinfo\")\r\n\r\nAlso I don't understand why Bitcoind core is flushing EVERYTHING including its whole cache of block data (about 760GB) according to logs to return to just a single block (about 45MB). shouldn't we split the cache in two parts, so that we flush it just in half, and then maintain two metafiles (one for the older view of the chainstate, another for the most recent, making sure that the older view will remain intact and will not be deleted as long as the new state is not finished: if the new state fails, at least we can recover from the previous state. old indexes don't need to be deleted immediately if they can be still referenced from the old state: this allow safe recovery in all cases (even if the daemon crashes for any reason and is unable to flush its state completely).",

      "body": "No Marco, cosmic rays are very unlikely, and overheating is definitely not the case. The bug is persistent even if it occurs \"unpredictably\" (for now because we don't know the exact cause) and in lot of different hardware and OS configurations, and even when running on very reliable systems (like Azure and Amazon VMs). And I have not noted any hardware issue reported by the OS or any problem in the filesystem which is always \"clean\", and based on very reliable RAID stores with multiple layers of hardware and software checks. It looks very much like a race issue in Bitcoin Core implementation itself (or its dependancies like LevelDB), which is more likely to occur on very fast machines and with very fast Internet connections.\r\nAll I did to limit the rate of these errors was to voluntarily slowdown Bitcoin Core. And I've never detected any block corruption when I compare the regular snapshots of data I make with backups or across the different hosts that I've tried. They just fail at different time, but they all fail sometime.",

But at one point, it remains jsut as one of the \"oldest\" one and it is unconditionally deleted even if it is referenced in newer indexes that were added in later passes.\r\n\r\nSo this is not a data corruption, but a logical error when deleting indexes.\r\n\r\nTo make this clear, I purged the logs from \"New tips\" and here is when a specific index file #9575 for the \"chainstate\" was created,

level and cache sizes. Note that reducing the cache size does not make the deaemon really slower, my filesystem is fast enough (and anyway the chainstate folder lives entirely on a SSD partition (also secured by RAID5) which exhibit no filesystem corruption at all, and no I/O error reported by kernel devices such as SATA adapters, bus handlers, memory managers...\r\n\r\nIt can then happen variably depending on cache size, and one the sped at which adata blocks were downloaded (or not if the could not still be discovered with a source offering them, as advertizeed by their \"headers\", and peers may choose to offer more or less block headers depednign on their capacity).\r\n\r\nNo corruption is ever detected in data blocks (blk*.dat) or their associated reverse indexes (rev*.dat).\r\n\r\nI can run \"-reindex-chainstate\" again and again, I get this error kalways, not just the same chainstate height. All this depends on how the cache is filled in memory (or if there are some entries or not in the mempool, but with a small cache and very early blocks heights, this should never happen). There seems to exist a specific boundary above which the cache \"compacter\" process decides to purge some indexes that it thinks are no longer necessary, but are still needed in later index files The algotithm used seeems to use an \"optimistic heuristic\" that can fail. A deep check is actually not performed.\r\n\r\nLevelDB  does not seem to be the cause of this bug, but it may be incorrectly queried so that the compacter may not find the appropriate index number for a given block height (may be some query can return several rows, and the compacter just considers the first or last row returned by the query, and forgets to process others, thinking that those queries can only return zero or one result; may be caused by a missing aggregation, or selection values not enough selective, e.g. with a \"poor hash\", sometimes producing an unexpected collision in a level-0 index).",

      "body": "Now it's time to investigate the condition that generated this type of log:\r\n\r\n> 2022-08-12T08:39:22Z leveldb: Delete type=2 #9575\r\n\r\nLevelDB performed very well what it was asked for (during the compaction of the cache in memory), just a few milliseconds before that (now missing) index was required again when Bitcoin resumed is indexing of the chainstate for further blocks with larger heights!\r\n\r\nIt is symptomatic that such crashes are ALWAYS occuring just after a compaction of the chainstate cache. Adn each time I check it, there's no corruption of the data, but the file referenced in the exit logs are always for files that were just deleted within the last second (in fact with extended timestamps in logs, that deletion occured less than 10 milliseconds before, inside the cache compacting which wants to regenerate a new tree of index files while keeping only a few \"old\" indexes that survived multiple passes of compaction).\r\n\r\nNote also that to make the bug reproducible always at the same height in the chainstate, you need to use \"-connect=0\" (nothing will be impacted in the root \"block 0\", no additional headers will be requested for getting new blocks later, something that occurs avery 10 minutes in the live chain), so you must have a safe copy of blocks (blk0*.dat and rev*.dat) generated by letting the deamon run for about 20 minutes until you interrupt it to get a clean backup of these files (it will stop with headers at unpredictable height depending on how fast you could connect to peers).\r\n\r\nThen flush the chainstate completely, and start the daemon once with \"-connect=0 -dbcache=4 -maxmempool=5\" and let it run for some minutes, you can terminate it and it will flush the chainstate to disk with some \"*.ldb files\". You can also checj that blocks files (blk*.dat and rev*.dat) where not touched at all by comparing their content with an archive you made in a \"block2\" directory. Now you can also backup the \"chainstate\" directory to \"chainstate2\".\r\n\r\nBut each time you'll try to the daemon once with \"-connect=0 -dbcache=4 -maxmempool=5\" from the existing chainstate, it will fail with the same height for the same missing index. You can restore that chainstate from \"chainstate2\" to \"chainstate\" (use robocopy no Windows or rsync to make exact mirrors) and relauch it, you'll always get the crash after about hald an hour at most, sometimes sooner (all this depends on when you interrupted the daemon, what was the max height in the main chain of block, or what was the max height of the chainstate, and what was the maixmum size o the dbcache.\r\n\r\nBut with dbcache=4 and maxmumpool=5, you'll get much more frequent calls to the compacter, and you'll finally fall in the \"edge\" case where it incorrectly deleted some indexes that are still needed. LEvelDB has nothing to do with that, filesystem corruption or bad hardware memory have nothing to do with that. It is entirely the internal logic of Bitcoinc Core that produces that, due to a bug in its \"cache compacter\", with incorrect tests.\r\n\r\nAnd you cannot diagnose it in an easily reproducible test if you use the default configuration (the cache is much too large, the compaction occurs too unfrequently and there's too much variation in the chain heights, because of the peers connected and the time you need to find headers and download full blocks. Some existing peers working \"successfully\" have probably NOT used the default configuration, but use extreme values for the dbcache, so that the \"compaction\" of the chainstate never occurs on them. But it's not reasoable at all to have extreme values of dbcache, even if you run it on a machine with 128GB of RAM and very large swaps. There's not even any need to have such extreme size for the performance of the daemon to run a full node, even with the existing rate of transactions in the mempool on the main chain.\r\n",

I see no record in your log of G:\\Bitcoin\\chainstate/009775.ldb being deleted (or touched at all since it being initially created in the beginning of your log).\r\n\r\nAfter this corruption, did you retry to get it going again with the `reconsiderblock` trick? The fact that that worked before, under the assumption that this is the same issue, proves there was no actual corruption on disk, so I think trying to investigate what LevelDB is doing is a red herring.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we really need a way to reproduce the problem. The fact that you're seeing this on cloud providers makes it indeed very unlikely to be a hardware issue, but there must be *something* unusual about your setup that causes you to consistently see this, while nobody else can reproduce it. That will either mean giving us steps that help reproduce it without your involvement (as @MarcoFalke has been asking), or we do this interactively with lots of back and forths to narrow it down.\r\n\r\nMy best guess at this point is the hint about running out of file descriptors. If you want to help us figure out what is going on, would it be possible to do a clean synchronization from scratch (no bitcoin datadir at all, no chainstate, no blocks) with `-debug` on, and then post the full debug.log file somewhere once you hit the corruption?",

      "body": "Starting from a fresh OS install is what I did already, in a vanilla installtion in a VM on Azure and AWS, with vanilla OS images.\r\n(I tried various OS distribs, Windows, and Linux) , all of them have failed to sync the IBD while indexing the chainstate. All of them have shown that some leveldb index files in the chainstate were incorrectly deleted/missing when the bug occured, each time just after a \"compaction\". It seems to be a race isue with the way you determine which index file can be merged (or splitted in half); may be there's an interaction with merge and split operations occuring together at the same time via some recursion.\r\n\r\nThat bug occus MUCH more often and more rapidly if we set a low dbcache and minimize the mempool size.\r\n\r\nCould that be also caused by the memory manager (that attempts to use the \"unused\" mempool size as a supplementary dbcache)? Is there a way to NOT use the mempool at all as an additional reserve for the dbcache in the chainstate (could be a race issue between the two pools, with some assumptions that the mempool would remain unused, when there are some pending transactions in the blocks to be indexes that could still fill in the mempool, before being flushed, because all these transactions in the old chain benig synchronized in IBD are normally terminated since very long and shuold exit from the mempool rapidly, but in some chain bineg sync'ed they could survive longer than expected and take more space than expected, not leaving enough space for the chainstate, thus causing more files than expected to be opened, whereas some merge operation in the chainstate should first occur to reduce the usage in the main dbpool and not need to use the mempool for transactions)?\r\n\r\nNote also that I have NOT compiled Bitcoin core, I use the vanilla binary compiled and signed on your download site. So this is the best I can do to create a \"reproducible\" case. The choice of OS does not seem relevant because I get the same bugs (occuring at varying height in the chainstate durnig the IBD, and depending on the memeory settings). As well a bug in leveldb is very unlikely (even if LevelDB itsefl had similar documented issues, see its test for its bug#200, which was fixed a long time ago, but may be did not cover all edge cases)\r\n\r\nLevelDb is used on billions devices and applications from major software providers, including all Chromium-based browsers (Android browser, Chrome, Ms Edge), and I've never found it failing anywhere, including all devices on which I tried to run Bitcoin Core (but may be the copy of leveldb sources inside your repository is out of sync, I did not check if that was the case, you certainly better know that than me.\r\n\r\nAlso note that I have used minimal options for runnign the deamon. I even allowed all logs to to displayed in the console, with maximum log settings. I've tried to let it run for about 20 minutes with no options, pressed control-C until I get anough blocks downloaded.\r\n\r\nThen I let it continue with -connect=0, to make sure that there's no interaction with newcoming headers for the most recent fullchain tip (which occurs avery 10 minutes). So I let the IBD continue until the end of the last known chaintip and no other blocks are downloaded in the background. Normally only the chainstate indexing should occur, and the only touched files are in the chainstate (plus the special block 0 containing the state).\r\n\r\nI do not touch any files between runs.\r\n\r\nAfter a failure, I  just try to restart with -reindex-chainstate, keeping all existing blocks. I also have several backups of these blocks (made with rsync on Linux, or robocopy with Windows), and when I check their content, they are always strictly identical between the different machines and backups. So there's no corruption at all of block data. (If I need to perform other checks, please explain me what I can do).\r\n\r\nNote that I have NO Tor connection, so I use -listenonion=0. I have both IPv4 and IPv6 working. I do not use any proxy.\r\n\r\nAlso have you got some test tool that allows inspecting the chainstate offline (when the daemon is not running), to make sure that it's correctly synced to disk when it exits or to get more information than what the deamon currently logs (whcih is very difficult to read)\r\n\r\nNote that leveldb index files use their own numbering, they are hard to correlate with block heights. The daemon jsut logs only some agregated counters of index files for each level in its tree, but no indicator at all about at least the height currently indexed in each index file (I know that there can be many index files, when I look at the counters for all levels, they reach a high total count with over 800 files. I don't know if they are all open in LevelDB, or if LevelDB maintains them open for a while in the background, but it may be the cause for not having any file descriptors available to the process, and causing the opening or creation of new files to fail. Is there a way to tune LevelDB so that it closes its used files more often (because the IBD indexing phase for the chainstate adds and removes many index files there at an incredible rate, I suspect that too many of these files are left open for a long, and even file deletions are left pending to be run in the background, and they could \"stack\" in a long chain of pending operations on, the file system, notably on fast machines.\r\n\r\nNote as well that I have tried to place the chainstate folder on another volume (by redirecting the chainstate directory with a symlink on Linux, or a junction or Windows) to minize the I/O interactions with the main blocks folder and maixmize the throughput with minimal I/O latency. I've also tried to reduce the CPU priority (nice in Linux) of the daemon, to give higher priority to the I/O threads in the OS. I've also tried to reduce the number of cores used by the deamon (using CPU affinity) so that there always remains unused cores for threads used by the OS or the filesystem (I've not seen in Bitcoin Core any way to tune the affinity for its many threads).\r\n\r\nWaht I noted also is with the QT version these bugs were ocuring much faster (because QT also needs its own threads, that's why I've stopped using it and now I only try with the CLI daemon). Every attmpts I've made on every machines and OS (with different capabilities, CPU, memory, storage types) have constantly failed in their IBD phase.\r\n\r\nSo I acn't beleive that others don't have this issue (or they don't complain to you, they have just abandoned the idea and just think that BitCoin Core does not work at all, or it's not for their machine). I tend to think that those for which Bitcoin core is running were just extremelt lucky, or that they do not the vanilla distribution and have compiled and fixed their bugs themselves (possibly by modifying the code and not reporting their suggested patch to you).\r\n",

      "body": "Also is there a way for leveldb files to have more meaningful names that their existing default numbering (a simple \"%06ld\" counter before the file extension)?\r\n\r\nFor example based on the minimum block height of blocks that are indexed in it possibly followed by a dash separator before the basic counter (using the full block hashes would be overkill)? It won't use up more space on the filesystem, but would simplify the debugging by easier identification of \"what goes where\".\r\n\r\nAre there ways to tune LevelDB to create regular \"snapshots\" with several manifests and logs for easier recovery after a crash (we could instantly restart from the previous snapshot if the last one was corrupted, of course this would mean that index files have to be mirrored to the snapshot, probably using a \"writeback\" mode, and no longer modified or deleted even if they are no longer in the newest working manifest).\r\n\r\nI also tend to think that BitCoin Core maintains the cache in memory much moe than what is needed, adn its LRU strategy is probably over-optimistic. And the way it performs its \"compaction\" (when the dbcache in memory is full) is way too agressive, it deletes eevrything on disk and regenerates all indexes, dropping many things with very weak checks (based only a a bacis reference counter without any basic inspection (such as using \"prev\" and \"next\" iterators on the first and last item present in the index about to be deleted to see if they are refefenced from another existing index which is kept).\r\n\r\nMay be the compaction is unsafe because it deletes the files in the wrong order, and the iterators used are not immune to deletion of items in the middle of the iterated list (there could be similar issues if an index file is splitted, causing an insertion in the middle of the list being iterated).\r\n\r\nOne way to test that would we to create a test where index files in the chainstate have a much smaller \"max size\" (which by default is about 2MiB): it would stress more often the \"compacter\" forcing it to cover much more \"edge cases\" if it was reduced to about 64KB (but also it would mean that there would be more active index files in the chainstate, so it would also stress the number of open files, to see if this is an issue in LevelDB, keeping too many open files in the process for some background management threads, and would indicate that LevelDB must be better tuned and controled about its own file system usage, or the numebr of concurrent threads it can use, or the maximum allowed length of its I/O queues (if it uses them).\r\n\r\nOr may be BitCoin Core forgets to call an API of Level DB to force it to sync to disk and close all handles just before Bitcoin Core attempts to use its own \"compacting\". I don't know if LevelDB supports that (but it should for many apps that want to get sure that all their daa is synced to disk before terminating safely, and possibly for creating their own safe snapshots which would be recoverable on demand).\r\n\r\n(Given the size of the chainstate folder, it peaks at around 2GB of storage, we could easily manage to keep about 3-10 snapshots, with one created every 5-10 minutes, it won't take long, notably if these snashots are in \"writeback\" mode with new files being created and mirrored in a writable copy only if aa index that is part of the snapshot is about to be modified). this would also allow easier recovery when restarting, without having to reindex the whole chain, if this was caused by a temporary overload on the OS or on the underlying filesystem, temporarily rejecting the creation or opening of new files (including for example if there are other tools runing on the OS such as security suites, antimalwares, OS update tools taking an exclusive lock on some parts of the filesystem...)\r\n\r\nAlso I've monitored everythin I could with the OS tools, in Linux or Windows (the file system I/O queues are far from being full, the physical disk I/O queues are responding nomally with very short but minor spikes, and latency remaining always below 20ms (so there's no excessive timeout issue occuring, CPU core usage in user or kernel space: there's a relatively high usage in the kernel space, meaning that there are lot of active system threads coing background work, posibly for optimizeing the filesystem, restructuring/compacting the allocation maps; but I see no core reaching 100%; as well I do not see alarming level of CPU temperature, no CPU throttle; disk temperatures are also stable in SMART controls, and I do not see any hardware alarms, errors, or recovery corrections applied being logged in system event logs).\r\n\r\nBut I cannot say the same about system handles: they are constantly and slowly growing (on Linux like on Windows), especially during \"compaction\" inside BitCoin Core, and never come back to normal levels. This indicates that LevelDB maintain too many open files (possibly just for shared locks even if there's no I/O and no exclusive lock). As well the total number of threads inside Bitcoind Core is slowly but constantly growing (each time after the \"compaction\" occurs, as we see them in the debug logs).",

      "body": "I have some good news (and bad news for you).\r\nFinally I chose to build bitcon core myself instead of using your binarise generated with guix (apparently on MacOS) for your sources from Git.\r\nFirst I tried to do that on  Windows, with WSL (installing the Debian OS image propsoed on the Microsoft Store). I made the necessary config (editing \"/etc/resolv.conf\" to configure a couple of DNS servers for the Internet) and then \"apt update\". I installed the necessary libraries and dependecies (also with \"apt install\").\r\nI DID NOT use guix (your instructions to install Guix do not work; on Debian, all you have to do is to use \"apt install guix\" which jsut runs fine as is, nothing else to configure!\r\n\r\nI ran the 521 test of Bitcoin_test and they all worked OK.\r\nI ran the bitcoind version that I compiled myself (it took just 10 minutes, much less than described and expected). And it works perfectly.\r\n\r\nThen I stopped it and reconfigured it to point the datadir to the Windows volume where I had placed them (mounted in WSL as \"/mnt/g/Bitcoin\", because on the Windows it is \"G:\\Bitcoin\" (there's nothing else on that volume, it's a NTFS partition of 800 GB mounted on a fast and reliable RAID, much enough for now for all datablocks and additional chainstate files taking about 2GB at most, and optional indexes for the coindb, txdb, bloomfiltersdb, or zmqdb if I allow them in bitcoin. conf)\r\nHere again there's no \"corruption\": all files that were generated on windows (notably all blocks already uploaded) validate as is without any change or need to resync.\r\n\r\nSo my opinion is that your GUIX environment running on MacOS and used to generate the binaries are the only cause of this bug that affects BOTH Windows and Linux. GUIX on MacOS is NOT reliable.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that I've tried to generate binarise by compiling them on windows with Visual Studio 2022. They work like a charm no Windows (either native, or in a VM hosted in Hyper-V or Azure, or hosted in AWS)!\r\n\r\nNote as well that I no longer observe any growing leakage of file handles after each \"compression\" stage in the chainstate. I cannot explain according to the sources why the \"chainstatemanager\" bugs like this in your GUIX-generated binaries.\r\n\r\nConclusion: build your releases for Windows and Linux on Windows or Linux (either native or in a VM). Abandon GUIX on MacOS (except possibly only for creating the MacOS releases). I think that your GUIX environment on MacOS does not use a correct C compiler, or its C runtime libraries (for cross compiling for other systems) have bugs and are not maintained correctly, or you've used Clang (which has some bugs, and not a vanilla GCC), or some obscure linker that generates incorrect bindings, possibly with some limiting \"shims\", but that are NOT fully compatible with Windows, and also not fully compatible with the Linux ABI when you target Linux.\r\n\r\nGUIX can only be the cause, or it is incorrectly installed on your MacOS machine used to generate the signed binaries released in v22 or v23 and offered for download on your official site!\r\n\r\nGUIX is a ery complex environment, it itsself has LOTS of depencies, if has lot of scripts, itruns multiple scripts using \"Guile\" and written with GNU Scheme. May be this is a bug of Guile (note that your instructions to setup Guile do not work, in fact I just ue the vanilla version of Guix provided as an installable .deb package using just the standard \"apt\" tool. For RedHat/Fedora/CentOS/OracleLinux/almaLinux and similar distributions may provide already their own .rpm packages ready to install. I don't know for Gentoo/ArchLinux and similar, or other rollig distribs but I would not use them for running BitCoin Core, when it is so simple to install a basic VM with a vanilla Debian which will be well manietained and reliable.\r\n\r\nAs well my binaries generated natively for windwos in Visual Studio 2022 run perfectly on all versions of Windows I tried (Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11, variable editions: Home, Pro, Enterprise, with or without an AD domain junction, with a local user account or with a MSA account, and running as a normal user or as an adminsitrator, without needing any UAC elevation).\r\n\r\nMy generated binaries made on Debian also work directly (without recompilation) on other Debian-based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Mint, PopOS...) indepenantly of the choice of the desktop environment (or its absence), and independantly of other initialisation systems (systemd, openRC, initd...).\r\n\r\nFinally I used a basic tool to convert build a basic .deb package with these binaries: it also worked on all Debian-based distributions. I converted the .deb to a .rpm with a basic tool and here again they worked without modification on Fedora, CentOs and AlmaLinux.\r\n\r\nI've also tried on these Linux to change the kernel versions (on distribs where we have the choice), and this did not impact anything. Only your bvinaries compiled with GUIX on yuor MacOS do not work reliably anwywhere on Linux and Windows! So I tend to think that ALL those that run BitCoinc Core successfully have in fact NOT used your signed binaries, but compiled the tools themselves on their machine, without using GUIX, jsut using the vanilla compiler of their plaform (with up to date libraeies, but as I've seen, I do not detect any bug when using older Linux kernels as long as these are Linux kernels 4+)!\r\n\r\nIt is very likely that your GUIX environment generates incorrect configurations for \"./configure\", such as not linking the appropriate libraries, or using limited but unsafe emulations/workarounds in the compiled files for things that seem critical here (notably mutexes, pthreads, file locks, may be async I/O... or some parts of the C runtime libraries that you link statically to the binaries).",

      "body": "As well I've found buffer overflows (corruptng the stack or the heap, depending on implementation of the standard C runtime libraries) which may explain some bugs occuring randomly.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by how logs are managed in the dbwrapper that you use with LevelDB. It's badly written, it uses a completely unneeded loop just to figure out (incorrectly) what buffer size will be needed.\r\n\r\nI've just replaced this class in src/dbwrapper.cpp. The existing code was not properly testing the return value of vsnprintf(), which **may** be larger than the given buffer size or may be negative!!!  No more buffer on the stack with a secondary buffer allocated elsewhere, and a single buffer allocated once on the heap. This also saves stack size. Allocating once a single 32KB buffer on the heap, even if it may seem overkill in size, has no importance in terms of memory, when BitCoin Core already uses tons of megabytes (possibly gigabytes) for its dbcache or mempool.\r\n\r\nNote that the buffer is allocated for each instance of the logger; if you have several db indexers (eg. for the coindb) running on separate threads. There's no locking/mutex mechanism to prevent that alass to be used concurrently and have that buffer partially overriden concurrently. But even if this occurs, that implementation will remain safe, we will not overflow the buffer, but may just log some partially mixed messages. If you need other dbwrapper instances, you can perfectly allocate a new dblogger instance, without having to use costly locks, it will cost you just 32KB per dbwrapper engine!\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass CBitcoinLevelDBLogger : public leveldb::Logger {\r\n    // This code is adapted from posix_logger.h, which is why it is using vsprintf.\r\n    // Please do not do this in normal code\r\nprivate:\r\n    static const int bufsize = 32768;\r\n    char *buffer = new char[bufsize];\r\n    ~CBitcoinLevelDBLogger() {\r\n        delete[] buffer;\r\n    }\r\npublic:\r\n    void Logv(const char *format, va_list arg) override {\r\n        if (!LogAcceptCategory(BCLog::LEVELDB, BCLog::Level::Debug)) {\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n        // Print the message\r\n        // Do not use vsnprintf elsewhere in bitcoin source code, see above.\r\n        va_list ap;\r\n        va_copy(ap, arg);\r\n        int n = vsnprintf(buffer, bufsize - 1, format, ap);\r\n        va_end(ap);\r\n        if (n >= 0) { // Note that n may be larger than bufsize - 2\r\n            if (n > bufsize - 2)\r\n                n = bufsize - 2;\r\n            // Add newline if necessary\r\n            if (n == 0 || buffer[n - 1] != '\\n')\r\n                buffer[++n - 1] = '\\n';\r\n            buffer[n] = '\\0';\r\n            LogPrintLevel(BCLog::LEVELDB, BCLog::Level::Debug, \"%s\", buffer);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThis also saves some stack space (the 500 bytes allocated at each call in the current code, always allocated, even if it is not used; and removes the unncessary loop to determine if we can use it or an external dynamically allocated buffer), and can avoid performance issues if there are many concurrent threads call it in dblevel. It unstresses as well the global memory allocator.\r\n\r\nYou'll note also that if n < 0 above, nothing is logged at all, this may eventually happen only if some given format or its values exceed the maximum allowed here (32KB should be sufficient for every useful message emitted by LevelDB, but may be we could log some statis text saying that something to long could not be logged (and may be dump the format string after converting '%' characters to some other safe character). This code will silently truncate excessively long logs emitted by LevelDB (and I don't think this has ever happened, even in its existing debugging code; if ever some debugging code needs to log very long things, they should create a separate file, and just send a log message saying where to find it; this would be essentially for logging crash events with many more details, or backing up / dumping some parts of its database, to be used by external leveldb debugging and analysis tools).\r\n\r\nNote as well that the call to LogPrintLevel() reuses another sprintf() function call (just with a basic \"%s\" format). May be it is also unsafe, why doesn't it allow passing just a plain text without any formatter?\r\nDon't you think we should have a LogPrintLevelStr() function to drop the remaining \"%s\" formatter above?\r\n\r\nLogPrintLevel() is currently defined as a macro, which just calls LogPrintf() by passing three additional parameters for the current function name, its source file and source line. We would need a more basic LogPrintStr() function (without the 'f' suffix) and a new separate macro LogPrintLevelStr() using it.\r\n\r\nAs well if I look in the sources, all uses of LogPrintf() are passing a string to be terminated by a static newline in the format string. We could just drop these newlines from all its input format string, and generate that extra newline internally (noly when necessary if the input format does not contain it); in that case the special management for appending the newline above would not be necessary at all.\r\n\r\nIf I look now in src/logging.h, LogPrintf() is also a macro, calling finally the function LogInstance().LogPrintStr() after performing the formating, using tfm::format and checking its result. A more basic LogPrintStr() would not need that. We are doing unnecessary memory copies again and unnecesary checks, as we could just call LogInstance().LogPrintStr() directly. This would also given some minor boost while also eliminating possible causes of unsafe uses of string formatters.\r\n\r\nLogPrintf() currently is based on the TinyFormatter implementation (usnig C++ streams and not the legacy C RTL library), and for me it looks safe (except that LevelDB sends it logs by assuming they will be formatted by the C RTL library: TinyFormatter has some additional restrictions, but I've not seen any one where this would break LevelDB, so may be we could use TinyFormatter here instead of vnsprintf(). If ever there's some new needed format used by LeveDB, we could easily patch TinyFormatter to accept them... except probably '%n' that TinyFormat considers really unsafe; other flags like 'L' not supported by TinyFormatter are just silently ignored, but could be added easily: TinyFormatter is not a complex module, and it uses basic C++ iostreams, so it's acceptable to patch it for Bitcoin Core if needed for our LevelDB wrapper).\r\n\r\nNow may be with this patch, your builds made in GUIX will have all the problems in this tread solved (I did not test it). I've just run the 521 unit tests and they all succeed when I build it outside of GUIX, and as well there's no longer issue in Linux or Windows, just like I said above.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nedit: you can freely change the constant 32768 above. During my experiments, I just growed it a bit from the value 30000 you used when allocating it on the heap, but this has no effect; I've even run successfully by setting it the the value 500 that you used when allocating the buffer on the stack, or 512 if you wish. This has no importance. It may be a constructor parameter.\r\n\r\nBut the key thing of this patch is: DON'T allocate the buffer on the stack at each log call, but allocate it on the heap once, when instantiating the logger for the dbwrapper. This is a clear sign that allocating the buffer on the stack, is causing the logger to write over some objects that are still living here.\r\n\r\nSo this is a clear sign of \"user-after-free\" bug in the rest of Bitcoin Core. And I suspect that theses are \"Span\" objects creating inside some calls to iterate over some temporary objects allocated no the stack, but that are referenced by some other aliases and that should have been copied in their own area and no logner used when the function creating the temporary objects returned.\r\n\r\nHere the logger wrapper function uses minimal stack space and avoid overwriting these objects, so we no longer see the \"corruption\" (one way to assert it with the existing logger, would be to clear (memset) the buffer in the stack entirely at each entry to the function: I'm quite sute you'll then hit the case where you've overwritten some temporary objects used after they were freed, and you'll get a reproductible case (e.g. run Bitcoin Core with \"debug=all\") where you get the \"corruption\" much earlier! Now you'll be able to diagnose what is wrong on other classes and may be able to locate these other bugs (that my patch above allows to avoid creating damages).\r\n\r\nIn summary, this is definitely not a hardware issue (and I've used LevelDB on other projects creating massing amounts of key/value changes with variable sizes and massive amounts of flushes/merges/splits) and never detected such corruption. The bug is definetely inside Bitcoin Core owned code.\r\n\r\nNote also that setting the \"checklevel\" to 4 instead of 3 in bitcoin.config (or in start options) always allows repairing these damages (at the price of a longer startup) when bitboin BCore (daemon, or QT version it does not matter) and continue without having to reindex the chainstate. This should be the default!\r\n\r\nNow it's time to locate this damned bug in the BitCoin chain manager (and notably inspect how its \"Span\" are used, possibly inside some of its unsafe iterators generating lists of objects in one function, then returning, then calling some logging function, then using these objects in other functions).",

I think it's caused by some async I/O, both on Windows (using VirtualAlloc) and on Linux (using mmap), probably becuse of some incorrectly managed locks. I'm investigating the code currently used in validation.cpp (in \"loadblk\" threads), as this seems to occur not just after a full compaction, but in fact after some index file at a given level gets splitted in two parts, and immediately one of them gets compacted with the next due to some recursion (and the lock already acquired by the thread for the first splitting operation does not protect from subsequent merging operations). This may be in fact an edge case inside the LevelDB library, possibly in one of its iterators (notably the backward).\r\n\r\n",

It's just for peace of mind and costs nothing. The \"LegacyParseInt?()\" and \"ParseInt?()\" functions may not set any value to their given variable reference if they return false into \"ok_*\" target variables. But nothing indicates that condition so the compiler warns as it cannot check that at compile time. As this is a test case to see if \"ParsInt?()\" and \"LegacyParsInt?()\" are behaving correctly (and are effectively setting the expected value in the referenced variable when they don't return an error flag; may be we could use some magic random values other than just 0, but different between \"LegacyParse?\" and \"Parse?\" as we will compare them, to detect such cases (which would signal a bug in their implementations, as this is exactly what these fuzz/test functions are intended to test). As well these functions are not required to set any value in their referenced output variable if they return an error.\r\n\r\nThe last unitialized value (in src/univalue/include/univalue.h) is part of Bitcoin Core's own RPC protocol with JSON, and I think it may be probematic, but not the cause of the dbcache corruption (which occurs even when there's no RPC at all, and I don't let the RPC server listening from other nodes, it is purely connected only on local 127.0.0.1 and only used by bitcoin-cli if I use it manually; but I may be wrong...).\r\n\r\nBasically, calling std::from_chars() and passing it a reference to an unconstructed object is undefined (not that result is not changed or set when there's an error indicated by the error_condition returned, but that call may fail with an error if the result is not constructed; thanks the result is a basic object, whose all that matters for std::from_chars is its type, and that type is basic enough to not require additional internal fields to be se; but all examples shown in the doc for the C++ std library show that it should be constructed ilmagine that the type \"Int\" object type given here was overriden with extra methods, e.g. with tracing/debugging function, or used a specific placement allocator...). Note that \"Int\" here is a typename template parameter, so it can be arbitrary class accepting to be set by std::from_char<Int> (we could as well have used <T>, the method just checks that <Int> is an integral type, but this could be some \"BigInt\" with a complex storage structure (or even a floatting point type with value checks in setters) and not just a basic integer type, so we should use its default constructor.",

      "body": ">  It's badly written, it uses a completely unneeded loop just to figure out (incorrectly) what buffer size will be needed.\r\n\r\nI certainly agree the code is unnecessarily complicated, but it's just an analogue of the logging code in LevelDB itself, but with Bitcoin Core's logging framework instead of printing to a file. See https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/v1.20/util/posix_logger.h#L34L92. What the code does is first try to write to a stack-allocated 500-byte buffer (correctly passing the upper bound of that buffer to `vsnprintf`, which won't write outside of it, but may indeed as you say return a larger number corresponding to how much it would have written). If the returned size exceeds the buffer size, a dynamically-allocated buffer of 30000 bytes is used, and the process is retried. If the returned size still exceeds the buffer size, the result is used as is (truncated to 30000 characters).\r\n\r\nIt's certainly possible there is a bug in this code, and I don't see it, and our sanitizers which are generally very good (but not perfect) at detecting buffer overflows don't catch it, but with what I've seen I think it is unlikely this is the culprit. That said, pull requests to improve the code are certainly welcome.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nBack to the original issue.\r\n\r\nAs I've said before, we really need a way to reproduce your problem. I've personally done several synchronizations from scratch, including a few just this past week, in Linux and Windows, using 23.0 and master branch code, from the network and using `-reindex-chainstate` and with reduced dbcache size, and never run into any form of corruption. I don't mean to imply there is something wrong with your system(s), but there must be *something* different about your systems that others don't have. I hope you believe me that no, others do not regularly see this, and no, not everyone has stopped using this software. You keep bringing up theories about what is wrong, but without the ability to reproduce and test that these issues are related, this is grasping at straws.\r\n\r\nPlease, do at least one of these two things:\r\n* Provide exact instructions on how to reproduce the problem you see in Azure, or a VM, or something else reproducible. Variations on \"do the default\" aren't sufficiently detailed, it appears, as people have tried this and failed to reproduce your problem.\r\n* Perform a synchronization from scratch, with `-debug` on the command-line (or `debug=1` in bitcoin.conf), until your corruption occurs, and then post the resulting full debug.log file somewhere.",

      "body": "I'm not contesti,g what the original dbwrapper's logger does; but it has a visible effect as it allocates and writes its buffer on the stack. And visibly this has the effect of overwriting other objects persisting on the stack that are apparently used after free.\r\nMaybe it's a bug of gcc or its libraries. But I did not choose any specific libaries, jsut used the current versions as shipped from the default in Debian bullseye; I did not try with any rolling release OS, so it should be fairly stable and most difficult bugs that may exist should be identified, and I shuold not be alone.\r\n\r\nIt's a fact that after trynig many common configurations, and on many machines, all installed with their default settings (just the necessary dependencies and regular system updates), I've never been able to complete the IBD on any machine (variable CPU types, memory, storages on SDD or HDD or fast RAID stores, it does not matter) with your official releases or even get a stable solution when trying to compile it from the Git sources (just a git pull from this repository, no differences, then ./configure and \"make all\".\r\n\r\nAnd debug logs (even with \"debug=all\" for logging options) do not reveal anything to explain the cause; I've just seen than compiling the daemon with debug (-g) compiling option just made it more stable. And that allocating the dbwrapper's logging buffer once outside the stack was also making it more stable. I've tried various configurations including reducing or growing the default dbcache size (let's ignore the mempool, I can reduce it, it does not matter in the IBD phase where it remains empty, but may be used as a supplementary space for the dbcache).\r\n\r\nThe number of combinations I've tried, even on very clean fresh installation of OSes and on fresh machines does not change the things. It has absolutely never worked reliably. So I cannot be alone (and I'm not alone visibly when I look for other users on various online forums, though some are trying to run it on very old and slow machines). In my opinion, the default logging options (even with \"debug=all\" in bitcoin.config are insufficient to isolate the cause, that's why I tried to compile it myself and run it through gdb, where I also get the same issue reported). So I absolutely do not know waht to do, and like others I'm stuck there without any solution.\r\n\r\nIf you still think my  configs have something special, you're wrong. I've tried many machines and very clean environments (and various OS distribs, and hardwares). IF this works for some people, may be it is because they have installed something else on their system which is not documented, but not provided by default on these systems. I even thought it could be specific to some x64 CPU models, but I've tried a large range of them (though I did not try with an AMD CPU, all the systems I've tested are Genuine Intel CPUs, various families 4 through 10, Core Duo, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, even Core i9). And I've never used any acceleration (default BIOS/EFI settings). All these systems were extremely stable with various types of softwares (except with Bitcoin Core). None of them were overheating or reported any hardware issue.",

      "body": "Well I have asked others to try using it, and in fact find absolutely no one that succeeded. The problem is not for me to reproduce the problem (it always happen for everyone), but how you exactly configured your systems to make it work (that's not documented at all and I know absolutely nobody that uses successfully your application, except on some very specific and non-disclosed server environments).\r\nSo I have used something else. I have lost too much time trying everything I could. Definitely it has NEVER been any hardware issue (it may have been an OS issue, but given the number of OSes and versions I've tried and others have tried too on their machines, always failing, this is very unlikely). So this can only be a software issue in your project, which has hidden/unchecked/undocumented assumptions, and/or incorrect documentation to get a working installation.",
