    "body": "For the 0.22 release we'll want to start hardcoding Torv3 addresses instead of (or in addition to) Torv2.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge here is not how to hardcode them, although that will require a few minor script and code changes, but how to collect them. The release process is to get the addresses from DNS seeders, however these currently don't support the `addrv2` message nor Torv3 addresses in the first place. Nor do they really have a need to.",

      "body": ">  A node behind Tor can't do the kind of DNS lookup that returns multiple results.\r\n\r\nExactly that's my point all the time and its even hard to say if a rouge exit node give us even the first and only entry correct when we resolve the seeders names indirect over Tor to get a socket for our seeders name ( could be the first entry of the DNS call that the exit makes for himself or anything else ) or that the exit give us even the correct socket on return to a real bitcoin full node and because Tor only nodes would have and do bootstrap anyway over ADDR messages by the socket returned when we ask for seeder names or if we use the hard encoding, if we say -dnsseed=0, we could have just called seeders Tor addresses full nodes in Tor always directly and have let all other ip4/ip6 nodes give us dns A/AAAAA records as is learend from seeders or gossip and encoding v3 in AAAA and btw we would also be backwards compatible, if old node would run script and generate a connect or addnode list?\r\n\r\n> servers to keep the results in the same order\r\n\r\nThat's why we would have needed some hashing and sortindex, redundancy to reassemble them correctly like a protocol that hides in a protocol. if we would  have used the old A/AAAA aproach ",
