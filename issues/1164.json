Are issues linked to number of causes or number of symptoms? I'd like to think the former, and if so, it's therefore only one issue, certainly one solution, IMHO. The solution I propose is that this can be (and should be) fixed during the -rescan operation, whereby the balance should be corrected based upon the transaction history for the addresses in the wallet. Also, as a matter of course, whenever a transaction is found to be invalid (due to the inputs having already been used), it should be shown as invalid, rather than remain \"unconfirmed\", IMHO.\n",
