    "body": "# Stop development Bitcoin!\r\nBitcoin has strayed from the decentralization philosophy that Satoshi Nakamotu intended and dreamed of.\r\n\r\nInstead of maintaining decentralization, Bitcoin surrenders user centrality to the authority again. This precaution is headed for an unstoppable disaster. Calling Bitcoin developers: stop supporting this.\r\n\r\nLet's develop the decentralized internet together on applications again, but bitcoin is used by the stock market, not the user.\r\n\r\n### Anonymity and privacy\r\nOur main goal was to use bitcoin independently of the stock market. Ungrateful like Binance and others completely remove the anonymity on the user.\r\n**Bitcoin is no longer secure so Anonymity has been eliminated.**\r\n\r\n### STOP USING BITCOIN",
