Setting up and hosting a small Gitlab/Gitea instance is quite easy, however, one facilitating a large project like this would see a lot of traffic and visitors and probably get a lot of hack attempts, too. It will not be a small job to manage this. \r\n\r\nThere's also the issue of trust. Github has been, at least up to now, a reasonable neutral third party. The one running the server could be tempted to manipulate reviews / ACKs or discussion, for example. Github could also do this but we've always assumed they don't have the incentive, whereas someone close to the project might.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to use signed ACKs, I suppose.",
