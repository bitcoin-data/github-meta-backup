    "title": "RPC does not limit failed connection attempts",
    "body": "As discussed in [this question](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3479/) on the Bitcoin StackExchange we discussed the possibility of an RPC-based attack through flash, java etc. Regardless of that specific attack vector's feasibility, RPC is still a potential attack vector if the network is compromised. It was determined in the course of this testing that Bitcoin does not limit the number of failed RPC login attempts, does not institute mandatory wait times after several failed login attempts etc. It will essentially allow as many attempts as you can throw at it, thus opening the door to trivially easy brute force.\n\nI don't claim to have the perfect answer to this one, but the issue of brute force attacks on RPC needs to be addressed.\n",
