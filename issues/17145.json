    "body": "When I created the bitcoin-qt GUI I made a big mistake in its design. I copied this more or less exactly from the wxwindows GUI. I was aware of this back in the day, but was planning to fix it later. I never got around to it. Honestly speaking I don't think I ever will.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the event loop in the main thread of a Qt program (or any GUI program, for that matter) is never supposed to block. Any operation that can take non-trivial time (even in the order of 40ms) should be executed asynchronously.\r\n\r\nWe have many such cases; not only when the user does an explicit operation such as send, but also in response to internal notiications, and automatic periodic polls for new transactions, the current balance, and so on (these can take longer due to `cs_main` lock contention: worst during initial sync and when catching up). Also at the start of the application. Pretty much all communication with the node and wallet happens in the GUI thread itself.\r\n\r\nThis is more \"redesign\" than \"refactor\", anyhow, and definitely not a \"good first issue\" it needs to happen at some point. Even more if we want [snazzy animations in the android GUI](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16883).\r\n\r\n(ref #17112 and plenty of other \"GUI not responding\" issues)",

      "body": "hi, I have extensive [experience](https://github.com/protoblock/protoblock) with qt/c++/blockchain/bitcoin and can potentially tackle this a first issue.  \r\n\r\ni came here while working on a proof-of-concept for new [bitcoin sidechain project](https://github.com/sidepit) and plan on decorating bitcoin-qt with custom functionality specific to that. \r\n\r\nquestion1: given the [bitcoin QT/QML project](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml), is this issue still relevant? as Widgets and QML are really different GUI frameworks. Would it not be best to just jump straight to developing with QML and fixing the blocking issues there? \r\n\r\nquestion2 is regarding the [Process-Separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Process-Separation), separating out QT from the core into its own process and communicated via IPC, really fundamentally changes the look feel responsiveness and overall proper design of the QT/GUI. if this process separation is something that we are committed to doing, maybe best to start there? and maybe even merge the two efforts into 1? separate the GUI into new QML in a new process? \r\n\r\nas a side note, from my experience trying it both ways, ( my previous project started as a separate process, [communicating via ipc to QT-Widgets](https://github.com/protoblock/fantasybit-2014/tree/windows/cute-fantasy), and a [single process with QML](https://github.com/protoblock/protoblock/tree/master/src/gui/qml)) , the single process was the way to go. in fact we started with ipc/widgets and refactored to single process/qml. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
