I run a node behind tor which I have explicitly setup to share my public IP because is dual attached and I only offer the tor side connectivity for the benefit of tor users and I very much do want it to bridge to the regular network.\n\nEspecially don't open ones with alarmist headlines— most bitcoin users with tor are connecting _out_, not running hidden services which is what you're measuring. It's trivial enough to see that when you're locally using proxy mode (e.g. tor) for your outbound connections that it does not send the public IP.\n\nBecause there is no explicit hidden service support before Peter's patches these nodes are probably just regular nodes and have no way of knowing that they're connected to tor.\n",
