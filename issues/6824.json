    "body": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6793 raised MinRelayTxFee to limit spamming attack which lead to crashing node. This is an effective solution, but this also changed the amount of Dust.\n\n```\nCAmount GetDustThreshold(const CFeeRate &minRelayTxFee) const\n    {\n        // \"Dust\" is defined in terms of CTransaction::minRelayTxFee,\n        // which has units satoshis-per-kilobyte.\n        // If you'd pay more than 1/3 in fees\n        // to spend something, then we consider it dust.\n        // A typical spendable txout is 34 bytes big, and will\n        // need a CTxIn of at least 148 bytes to spend:\n        // so dust is a spendable txout less than 546 satoshis\n        // with default minRelayTxFee.\n        if (scriptPubKey.IsUnspendable())\n            return 0;\n\n        size_t nSize = GetSerializeSize(SER_DISK,0)+148u;\n        return 3*minRelayTxFee.GetFee(nSize);\n}\n```\n\nSuch sudden change of a widely used default hurted other meta-layer protocols such as Counterparty, Omni, ChanceCoin, NewbieCoin, OA, EPOBC, Colu.\n\nAs well as wallets : if you want to send 1000 satoshi to Alice, but have a coin of 2100 satoshi. A wallet with MinTxRelayFee of 1000 will send the 1100 satoshi of change.\nBut if you change the MinTxRelayFee abruptly to 5000 like that and I don't update the wallet software, now, the transaction will be ignored because the change is considered Dust.\n\nThe dust rule prevents UTXO bloating by preventing the creation of TxOut whose value is lower than the cost of the ScriptSig to spend it.\n\nThere is some discussion about making a floating minRelayTxFee on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6722 which will even more complicate the task for wallets and services who will need to get this new variable from somewhere.\n\nI am opening this issue to propose another solution : Defining Dust as a function of the Transaction Fee.\n\nThis has the advantage to not require any data which a wallet or service does not already have, and offer the best response we can get of \"does this output cost more than spending it\". This can also be easily implemented and reviewed.\n",

Please go battle out with coblee who was loudly calling Bitcoin flawed for not adopting litecoins progressively _higher_ fees with more dust. :)  \n\nKeep in mind that the relay fee and dust limits are minimums---- if you're depending on sending things at the minimum you may have a bad time; especially if you're doing so without the benefit of realtime network intelligence (e.g. a mempool.). Since the minrelayfee is a _minimum_ (at least for non-treated-as-free transactions) a scheme based on the actual fees would also not result in anything but a higher dust threshold.\n\nI suppose you could already go ahead and use the actual fee for your dust threshold behavior-- you'll end up with an overly conservative value, but so long as you're meeting minrelayfee you have enough.\n",

I can't use exactly the fee rate of the actual transaction, this will be too high and overkill, but if I take anything less based on some formula, then I'm not garanteed that one day, the minRelayTxFee will move again and break what I did.\n\n> Making them depend on the actual fees would have the perverse incentive of encouraging lower fees to squeeze more dust through.\n\nyes, but if you lower fee, your transaction might not end up in a block or mempool anyway, because it will be kicked out by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6722 . My observation does not exclude having PR 6722, just that MinRelayTxFee and Dust be decoupled so wallet don't need any other external magic value.\n",

Not based on any estimated optimal fee or anthing like that.\nIf a transaction is relayed and mined with a certain fee that means that that fee/kb is a fee that has a chance of getting mined, thus making the dust based on that should be a fair choice.\n\nAlso something to consider is that wallets when doing coin selection are supposed to avoid a dust change output and instead add it to the fee. \nSo your point about not relying on minimums for the various meta protocols @gmaxwell is a valid one, they could easily use a higher value because the coins are never lost.  \nbut for determinating if it's worth adding a change output or not is a very different case, there needs to be a clear threshold where wallets decide to give the coins to the miner instead.\n\nor do you have a different opinion / idea on how a wallet should decide when it's no longer worth adding a change output?\n",

If the transaction reach the mempool and is not kicked by #6722 then we can consider the fee to be a fair value and by extension, the dust calculated upon the fee of the transaction to be fair too.\n\n@TheBlueMatt the question is less about what is the appropriate minRelayTxFee and more about what wallet providers should do to prevent being burned by such unpredictable changes. If wallet consider the optimal fee rate for the basis of dust, they are overly conservative, but if they consider anything less, then a future change of minRelayTxFee might break things again. Also, as said, using fee is a better way to know if the output is economical than any magic value.\n",
