    "title": "Bitcoin Core is unstable in the presence of sudden OS crashes",
    "body": "Bitcoin Core is unstable in the presence of sudden OS crashes. There are two scenarios that cause problems which I experienced:\n1. Sudden power loss\n2. Stopping a Virtual Machine suddenly\n\nThe symptoms are:\n1. A lengthy \"verification\" operation on the next startup\n2. Sometimes, reindexing of blocks is necessary because some \"corruption\" is reported (this is so slow that deleting all blocks and syncing from the network is faster)\n\nAre Bitcoin Core databases not crash consistent? I'm used to the situation that databases tolerate sudden power loss without loss of data or consistency. This is a core feature of \"Enterprise\" RDBMSes for example, and it does work as advertised in practice. Could we have crash consistency for Bitcoin Core, too?\n\nI imagine this can be a problem for automated operations because during the \"reprocessing\" phase the software is unavailable.\n\nIn case this is considered a bug, maybe there should be automated tests for crash consistency (e.g. powering off a VM suddenly).\n\nThis was version v0.10.2, run both on real hardware as well as virtualized on VMWare.\n",

Maybe the block makes it to disk but the index does not. Or, the other way around. Or, only some of the disk blocks of each make it and the other ones are zeroes.\n\nMaybe, the wallet is also not properly flushed: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7249#issuecomment-166962314\n",

This problem is significant because when it strikes Bitcoin Core becomes unusable for most purposes for a few days while the database rebuilds.\n\nCan anyone else reproduce this? Steps are above (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7233#issuecomment-166707144).\n\nI imagine fixing this is not too hard (?) because most database systems are built with crash consistency in mind. Maybe all that is needed is changing some LevelDB settings?\n\nAlso note, that quite a few people are being affected by this: https://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en#q=bitcoin+core+database+corrupted&complete=1&hl=en&start=0\n",

      "body": "Did more tests:\n\nNow I had a new phenomenon: I let it catch up to 33 weeks behind, then exited Bitcoin Core normally. When the process had naturally exited, the chainstate folder was just a few KB in size and indeed after starting the software it is now re-syncing from disk. This is new.\n\nTrying it now on a completely fresh Win7 SP1 x64 VM with just Bitcoin Core installed: Killing the process 6 times never caused corruption. Powering off the VM frequently causes corruption. This is on a magnetic disk now and the corruption comes about 1 in 3 times. So this test shows that the Windows instance is not somehow messed up.\n\nI unplugged my SSD once. Also caused corruption.\n\nJust checked the NTFS file systems in all test VMs: No corruption. This is evidence against the disks violating their durability guarantees.\n\nTonight I experienced a blue screen. The old VM became corrupt. The new VM did not report corruption but reindexing started at block zero.\n\nI can only encourage you to experiment with different ways of interrupting Bitcoin Core. You will find \"unexplained phenomena\".\n\nI'll let this rest now and will stop testing. I recommend to regularly backup the chainstate folder. It's not too big and it can save a tremendous amount of time in case something happens.\n",
