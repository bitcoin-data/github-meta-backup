    "title": "wallet flushing thread could use improvement",
    "body": "In [a recent blog post](http://laanwj.github.io/2017/04/19/bitcoin-test-qemu-cache-settings.html) Wladimir writes that:\r\n\r\n> It turns out that [tests run slowly] because the wallet code does an fsync after every operation to make sure that changes to the database are safely written to disk\r\n\r\n`ThreadFlushWalletDB()` in `src/wallet/walletdb.cpp` has roughly the following logic:\r\n\r\n    every 500 milliseconds:\r\n        if (the wallet has been modified since the last time it was flushed to disk &&\r\n            the wallet hasn't been modified for at least 2 seconds &&\r\n            we can get a database lock &&\r\n            the database isn't currently in use):\r\n        then\r\n            flush it to disk\r\n\r\nThis has a couple of problems:\r\n\r\n* If the wallet receives a deposit every second, the \"hasn't been modified for at least 2 seconds\" condition is never met, and so the wallet is never flushed to disk. Perhaps the loop needs to have an extra check, \"if the wallet wasn't flushed in the last N1 seconds then flush it now even if it was modified in the last 2 seconds\".\r\n\r\n* If the wallet receives a deposit every 2.5 seconds, the \"hasn't been modified for at least 2 seconds\" condition is almost always met, and so the wallet is continually flushed to disk. The wallet file grows bigger with each deposit, and the flushing causes a full rewrite of the file. This causes a quadratically increasing disk usage over time, eventually swamping the capacity of the drive. Perhaps the loop needs to have an extra check: \"if the wallet was flushed in the last N2 seconds then don't flush it now, even if it wasn't modified in the last 2 seconds\".\r\n\r\nIs there some way of safely updating a BDB database without rewriting the whole file to disk for every update? This seems like a major inefficiency.\r\n\r\nI've been struggling with this issue of ever increasing hard drive use as wallet size grows for years now, but only recently discovered the root cause of the problem.",

      "body": "I think the major inefficiency is in BDB itself.\r\nNot sure if we can improve this much further.\r\n\r\nIMO the most promising solution to this is switching the database type. @sipa's logdb was IMO the best alternative (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5686). Though, append only maybe no longer be always efficient (since `abandontransaction` we do update single-property wtx state).\r\n\r\nOthers have discussed about switching to sqlite, which IMO is reasonable for the transactions and maybe the pubkey cache.\r\n\r\nFor HD wallets, we could probably store the 256bit seed material as Bech32 together with the used-keypath-scheme in a single file that only gets written once. Then maybe use a form of @sipa's logdb as wtx/pubkey storage.\r\n\r\nThe path to that would be to abstract the database interface first (in order to allow BerkleyDB and LogDb the same time [to allow smooth migrations]).\r\n\r\nWe already made some baby-steps (#9256, #9143, #9142), next one would be #9951.",

      "body": "> Is there some way of safely updating a BDB database without rewriting the whole file to disk for every update? This seems like a major inefficiency.\r\n\r\nTo be clear: despite the name, ThreadFlushWalletDB was not actually a flush thread.\r\n\r\nWhat does the actual fsyncing I'm talking about in the blog post is the destructor of CWalletDB if the constructur was called with `_fFlushOnClose = true`.\r\n\r\n`ThreadFlushWalletDB` doesn't exist anymore in master. It now is scheduled by `CScheduler` and has the more suitable name `MaybeCompactWalletDB`. \r\n\r\nBut more importantly: Compacting the database is not required to \"safely update\" the database. The only reason for doing it is to keep the database contained to one file most of the time.\r\nNormally a bdb database consists of a `.dat` file and a directory with log files that contain uncompacted updates to it. But this was deemed confusing for users, a long time ago.\r\n\r\nIf you don't care about that you could (AFAIK!) safely disable that periodic compaction.\r\n\r\n> I've been struggling with this issue of ever increasing hard drive use as wallet size grows for years now, but only recently discovered the root cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nThis one I don't understand - why would compaction result in a larger file? Isn't it just that your wallet accumulates more transactions and keys over time?",

But constantly rewriting an ever growing file is problem.\r\n\r\nI would prefer if there was an option to have the wallet 'forget' about transactions which are no longer of any interest. ie. if it no longer gives me any utxos then I don't care about it. I do care about account balances, but not individual transactions. That way the wallet.dat file wouldn't grow without limit. In the past I have seen wallet.dat grow as large as 260,857,856 bytes. Having 260MB written to disk every 2 seconds can really kill performance.",
