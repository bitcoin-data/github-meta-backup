    "title": "Reduce boost dependency (boost/algorithm/string/split)",
    "body": "Proposing a method to remove the dependency of the boost/algorithm/string/split library. It can be done by including a small function in utils or adding a small alternative code patch in its use cases. The proposed method is much more efficient than the  boost/algorithm/string/split. Here is a small demonstration which performs the same task in just 11 microseconds compared to boost library which takes 30 microseconds. ([View here](https://gist.github.com/Purva-Chaudhari/7125b173f7cfba3a5995220ab6a75e89))\r\nThe suggested alternative would reduce boost dependency in the files and thus improve their compilation and execution efficiency.\r\n\r\nFollowing reference states that over big data the boost split performs a lot slower compared to stl implementation:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5505965/fast-string-splitting-with-multiple-delimiters. \r\n\r\nI'm happy to open a PR with these changes, but currently looking for concept ACKs to confirm if this is a good direction.",
