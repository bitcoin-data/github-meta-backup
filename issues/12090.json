Some of them are listed as follows\r\nwalletnotify=\"/home/ec2-user/cron/receive.php %s\"\r\nwalletnotify=/home/ec2-user/cron/receive.php \"%s\"\r\nwalletnotify=\"/home/ec2-user/cron/receive.php\" %s\r\nwalletnotify=/bin/bash /home/ec2-user/cron/receive.sh %s\r\nwalletnotify=/bin/php /home/ec2-user/cron/receive.php %s\r\n\r\n- I also tried by creating a separate page and configured it through CURL command as follows\r\n   walletnotify=/bin/curl http://127.0.0.1/receive.php?trx=%s\r\n\r\nI also tried by running the **bitciond** daemon from root user. I also verified folder permissions which are fine.\r\n\r\nIn short I have been struggling with this from couple of days but unable to succeed.\r\nI always get same error which is **return -1** along with the command that I entered in configuration file.\r\n\r\nNot to mention that rest of the **bitcoin core** features are working fine.

I generated a new address through bitcoin-cli.\r\n2. Against the new address I tried to issue free bitcoins from one of the testnet faucet.\r\n3. I can see transaction number on the faucet website which shows transaction was created successfully on faucet website.\r\n4. But I don't see any wallet notify event in debug.log file. Please correct me If I am guessing wrong that one of the possible reason could be the db is in synchronization process with the main block chain testnet database. Once synchronization is completed then it will issue walletnotify command.\r\n\r\nIs there any other way I can trigger this walletnotify event separately without synchronizing the database  for testing purpose?\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  ",
