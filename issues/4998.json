      "body": "I figured out my issue. I had bitcoin installed ages ago and was pretty sure I uninstalled but but I guess not. What I was doing was opening the 32bit version, as soon as I opened the 64bit version I could the 0.9.3\n\nThe now real issue is in 0.9.3 for windows x64 doesn't have an address book. I can't see my addresses, so I wanted to send someone bitcoins I would basically be screwed because I can't retrieve my wallet ID. \n\nI sent as a set some bitcoin from another wallet to my bitcoin one (the same ID I had in the 32bit one) and coins are coming in but everything is kept secret I can't see where it's coming from. When I try to add my ID back to the 0.9.3 it comes back and say that Wallet ID is already in your address book. (which I can't see).\n\nBug? I don't know.. but you shouldn't be stopping people from seeing their Wallet ID's.  \n",
