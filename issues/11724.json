    "body": "Using 0.15.0.1 from BitcoinCore.org, running on a fast x86 system with SSD and 16 GB of RAM.\r\n\r\nWhile syncing this instance my `UpdateTip` was around 2017-06-30 when I ran out of disk space so the daemon auto shut down. I knew about this feature so I thought to go ahead with sync even though I knew I may be few GB short.\r\n\r\nAfter I restarted, resumed `UpdateTip` entries were from early 2015-03, so it rolled back 27 months. \r\n\r\nMaybe that's due to the fact that the node is fast and my dbcache large so I ran out of space before bitcoind could safely shutdown, but still - I find this 27 month rollback excessive. Maybe the auto-shutdown feature could shutdown in a more timely manner.\r\n\r\nConfig:\r\n`dbcache=8000`\r\n`txindex=1` \r\n\r\nDebug.log:\r\n\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/gEZz3zDD\r\n",
