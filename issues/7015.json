    "body": "I ran into this during testing on BIP101. My mempool was pretty full, so GBT was slow. During one 12-second GBT call, ckpool found a block:\n\n```\n[2015-11-14 00:26:16.931] Possible block solve diff 541623.733740 !\n[2015-11-14 00:26:26.164] HTTP socket read+write took 10.954s in json_rpc_call ( \"getblock...)\n[2015-11-14 00:26:29.144] BLOCK ACCEPTED!\n[2015-11-14 00:26:29.157] Solved and confirmed block 604647\n```\n\nNote the timestamp. That's 12.2 seconds of delay between ckpool making the block solve and bitcoind accepting the block. I can see the other 1.3 seconds as possibly being block verification time or dealing with the other network messages that piled on during the 10.9 seconds that GBT took. IIRC, this was a 5 MB block.\n\nThis problem was seen on BitcoinXT, not Bitcoin Core, but it affects you too, so I thought I should notify upstream (Core). The underlying issue is how locks are done in CreateNewBlock and elsewhere. Locking cs_main in everything, including both submitblock (rpcmining.cpp:639) and getblocktemplate, is problematic.\n\nA workaround for this is to set up multiple bitcoinds, and set the poolserver to do submitblock to all of them in parallel. Kinda nasty, though. Another workaround is to speed up CNB a la @morcos's work. The locks should still get fixed, though.\n",

CreateNewBlock needs to lock against modifying or deleting transactions and against reorgs. It also needs to make sure it's working off of the same blockchain tip the entire time, so it needs to grab a pointer to the tip at the beginning. It also needs to grab a view of the mempool that will not change. It does not need to prevent new transactions from being added to the mempool or new blocks from being added to the blockchain.\n",

The issue you've reported (That calling GBT ends up blocking submitting blocks for an unreasonable amount of time) will get fixed, but will not likely get fixed by making things run lock free (or at least not mostly!).\n\nBut all I was saying is that it sounded like were underestimating the complexity of safely eliminating locking around blockchain/mempool access, and overestimating the necessity of doing so. But the report at face value, is a fine one, and thanks for making it.\n",

      "body": "@pstratem getblocktemplate does not make any writes to anything except the block template and its own CCoinsViewCache. Nothing that getblocktemplate creates is consumed by anything else except for the RPC caller. Any data that getblocktemplate needs from the rest of the system can be copied or (e.g. for mempool) locked in a fine-grained manner.\n\nFurthermore, there is no need for submitblock to lock everything for the entire duration of its activities. It can change the order of operations to check the new block's validity, commit it to memory as an object (but not necessarily as part of the chain), and notify peers all before locking cs_main and executing UpdateTip. \n\n@gmaxwell, if verifying a block actually requires mutable access to the chain state in order to verify a block (which sounds surprising to me, but I'll admit that I haven't checked and you probably know better than me), it still could be implemented with a lock just around the TestBlockValidity() calls. With production code, a medium-small fraction of the total time is taken in TestBlockValidity(). With morcos's work, that fraction dominates, it's true. It's also likely that calling TestBlockValidity both before and after sending a template to a miner is redundant.\n\nAnyway, I agree that this issue is not something that should be addressed right now, given how much faster GBT will be soon. I'd call it more of a target of opportunity. When writing code in the future, I think we should make an effort to think about what we actually need to have locked, and only lock those things. You are welcome to ignore my opinion.\n",

Generally the thought has always been that we should only relay validated data and ban peers who break the rule, but there is a reasonable argument to be made to relay blocks with a special flag indicating they have not been validated (except for their PoW and basic sanity checks). I'm not a big fan of the idea because we've already people mining on unvalidated (and invalid) blocks and we should generally avoid making it easier to do so. That, plus validation is becoming quicker and quicker (with yet still a bunch of improvements in 0.12).\n",

      "body": "@jtoomim That was actually implemented previously (by luke-jr) and didn't improve performance back then. It probably would now.\n\nIt's _really_ critically important to not hand unverified blocks to SPV clients; but that is avoidable, in that you can specifically negotiate forwarding non-verified blocks and tag them as such (which is also how you avoid transitive partitioning due to misbehavior banning); so no one is surprised by them (which is what luke's patch did).   I'm fearful how that will interact with verification free mining :( but the harm there is created by the verification free mining, and not by the pre-forwarding...  Rather than twiddling the basic p2p protocol, however, it would probably just make more sense to handle this in new block relay mechanisms which are explicitly unverified-- since we now know we can do a lot better than the classical p2p protocol.\n",

      "body": "Harm with the verification-free mining is caused by the miner never verifying the chain, not by the miner making delayed verifications of the chain. I like to call this the difference between optimistic SPV mining and blind SPV mining. (I know the term SPV mining is inaccurate because no payments are being verified, but it's short and people understand it.) I don't think there's much to worry about about a fork with a 2-block invalid branch, and anything longer is vanishingly improbable if verification times are less than about 20 seconds per block. The problem is when the fork goes on for hours. \n\nI think the Chinese (and everyone else) learned their lesson on this one: blind SPV mining is expensive. They might not care about the harm it causes other Bitcoin users much, but as long as they care about keeping their mining rewards, I doubt anyone will make the same mistake again.\n",

      "body": "@jtoomim SPV clients make a _very_ strong security assumption that the blocks they receive have been validated;  if you setup a simulator and model success rates for 2-confirm invalid block attacks with a small hashrate attacker (e.g. 1%), even short duration extension without verification massively amplifies the success.  The result is surprising, but less so when you realize that most blocks are \"fast\".   There are a great many users that accept transactions at 2-confirms (and even wallets that just display 'confirmed' with no count at all), wise or not. So I don't think it's correct to say that it only matters if it goes on for hours.  It's only the SPV nodes that need to be worried about in any case; full nodes will happily ignore the invalid blocks. :)\n\nYou should also consider more than the verification time; most mining stacks (including the hardware/firmware itself) often has fairly high latency (and/or takes a performance hit if your update their work frequently)-- usually I use a rule of thumb and figure any work you issue will be hashed on for at least 30 seconds. When I observe work issued by pools, the delay from the first pool to half the pools moving to a new block is about 10x what bitcoind verification time is (even before the speedups in 0.12). \n\nOne of the larger verification skipping miners responded that even with the losses, they believe it has been very profitable for them, and they would continue doing it.  \n\nBut in any case, even all that said I think it's largely orthogonal with the aggressive forwarding.  Any amount of block extension without verification invalidates the security assumption of SPV; but thats a fault of extending bad chains, not a fault of forwarding things eagerly at least so long as the eager forwarding is marked as such.\n",

We can blame \"SPV\" miners for it, we can blame SPV wallets for doing it, or we can recognize that economics that are stronger than us have dictated their use and try to design a system that allows them to coexist with risks that each party deems acceptable. Such a system might be possible with an isVerified flag that SPV miners could use to talk to each other and fully verifying nodes could use to talk to each other more quickly and which SPV wallets could run away from. It might be necessary to think of a way to punish dishonest use of that bit.\n\n[redacted paragraph]\n\nOne protection against forwarding bad chains that would be cheap to implement is only optimistically forwarding an unvalidated block if it is based on a block that has been fully validated. This would limit forwarding of invalid chains to 1 block in length while still allowing for the vast majority of the performance benefit.\n",

Once we have the MASTER lock we take out the VAR lock, then decrement the counter and if it is zero, we clear the boolean \"notify\" then release the VAR lock.\n\nWhere's the CPU usage issue in that design? There is none.\n\nNow, I'm not at all sure why I need to explain locking techniques to developers, but I am quite surprised that I need to.\n",
