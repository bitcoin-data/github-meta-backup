No systemd, no service, but in screen session, in bash loop. Bash loop allows it to automatically restart, so I experienced no downtime, bitcoind has started again automatically.\r\nFull command line bitcoind was running with is:\r\n`/home/user/bitcoin/bitcoin-23.0/bin/bitcoind > /home/user/.bitcoin/logs/2022-11-14_02h04m24s.log 2>&1`\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nServer-style machine with ECC RAM:\r\nOS: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) x86_64\r\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 (16) @ 3.000GHz [28.0Â°C]\r\nRAM: 64GB RAM 2666 MT/s Multi-bit ECC\r\nHDD: Btrfs raid10 mode, 4x 4TB Hard Drives. No issues with Btrfs or drives, all perfectly clean\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version?

Log file ends cleanly with no error messages, last few lines are:\r\n```\r\n2022-12-13T17:50:00Z Socks5() connect to xxx.onion:8333 failed: host unreachable\r\n2022-12-13T17:50:44Z connect() to 127.0.0.1:7656 failed after wait: Connection refused (111)\r\n2022-12-13T17:53:14Z connect() to 127.0.0.1:7656 failed after wait: Connection refused (111)\r\n2022-12-13T17:57:22Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000031509b87e82e97a74d09c703ed21ee0a91fd90b5c6656 height=767249 version=0x20a00000 log2_work=93.893910 tx=787817132 date='2022-12-13T17:57:18Z' progress=1.000000 cache=5.6MiB(23274txo)\r\n2022-12-13T17:59:16Z connect() to 127.0.0.1:7656 failed after wait: Connection refused (111)\r\n2022-12-13T17:59:34Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000044c776b362f68b0e645a1d7366e3b50a10a7809af50fc height=767250 version=0x23778000 log2_work=93.893921 tx=787819399 date='2022-12-13T17:59:22Z' progress=1.000000 cache=6.6MiB(31759txo)\r\n```",

Unfortunately I don't think it'll be possible for me to reproduce this, even with all the (detailed!) info you've provided, and I would be surprised if anyone can learn anything from that `dmesg` line.\r\n\r\nOn that basis I don't know whether it's worth keeping this issue open at all, as I don't see how it can be addressed. If it is closed then will still be searchable via the repo in the case that we get a second report of it.\r\n\r\nSorry not to be more help.",

In the meantime, you can close the bug if necessary.\r\nYou can also tell me if there are any steps I can take to debug bitcoind more thoroughly than the default way, I can install debugger or whatever is necessary, as long as it let run bitcoind normally so I can use it as usual.\r\n\r\nKind regards",
