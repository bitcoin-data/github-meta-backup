    "title": "Compile release binaries with -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero",
    "body": "We make heavy use of sanitizers and memory checkers to catch memory related issues that are inherent to the C++ programming language as early as possible.\r\n\r\nOne example is uninitialized reads. They come in many forms, but one of them is\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nint foo;\r\nif (!Parse(\"-1\", foo)) return\r\nstd::cout << foo << std::endl;  // Can be uninitialized read, depending on implementation of Parse\r\n```\r\n\r\nSometimes programmers initialize `foo` to a constant like `0` or `-1`, but such practice is defeating the whole purpose of memory sanitizers. That is, for a memory sanitizer it is now impossible to detect an uninitialized read.\r\n\r\nHowever, I suspect that no one is running with sanitizers enabled in production and it would be nice to not expose production systems to undefined behaviour. So I was wondering if anyone would object compiling and shipping the release binaries with `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero`?",

(Potentially disastrous for our users.)\r\n\r\nA cure (`-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero`) has been presented.\r\n\r\nUsing it means that the disease is cured (no more reading of uninitialized memory to bypass ASLR or leak secrets), but it comes with a nasty side effect (`valgrind` can no longer be used to detect uninitialized reads in production binaries).\r\n\r\nHow do we handle this trade-off? Personally I share the view of the security engineers in the Chrome, Android, Windows, iOS and macOS teams who have all started using the equivalent of `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero` in some form for their production builds: the cure is worth using despite said unfortunate side-effect :)\r\n\r\nAm I missing any negative side effects, or is the description of `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero` as a \"cure\" unfair in some way?

This includes -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero, which may result in bugs being present in the binary that aren't present in a binary without (but won't crash or trigger any other easily detectable sign). People running valgrind on a valgrind-optimized binary without zero initialization may not discover it because it's not present in their binary, and people running valgrind on the zero-initialized version may not discover it because valgrind's ability to detect issues is reduced in those. Just in general, the advantage of valgrind over other analysis tools is that has the ability to detect issues present in the exact binaries we release - introducing a separate valgrind-optimized version removes that advantage.\r\n\r\nThat said, again, I also see the advantage of reducing risk by initializing all variables even if it comes with a reduction in ability to detect issues.",

      "body": "It is always interesting to see how others are choosing to tackle the same type of problems we are facing:\r\n\r\nYesterday [Joe Bialek](https://twitter.com/JosephBialek) from the Microsoft Security Response Center's Vulnerability & Mitigations team posted this excellent [article on what Microsoft is doing to eliminate uninitialized stack memory vulnerabilities from Windows](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/05/13/solving-uninitialized-stack-memory-on-windows/) using the equivalent of `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero` (`InitAll`).\r\n\r\nThe results are pretty remarkable: an entire security bug class which has historically accounted for roughly 5-10% of Microsoft's CVE:s is effectively killed from a security perspective through this technique.\r\n\r\nSome interesting quotes:\r\n\r\n> There are really two distinct classes of vulnerabilities here:\r\n> - Uninitialized Memory Disclosure – Uninitialized memory is copied across a trust boundary and its contents are disclosed to a less privileged entity.\r\n> - Uninitialized Memory Use – Uninitialized memory is directly used. For example, an uninitialized pointer is written through.\r\n\r\n> It’s also important to realize that uninitialized memory problems occur for both stack allocations and heap allocations. This blog is focusing on stack memory and a follow up blog will address heap memory.\r\n\r\n> In recent years, uninitialized memory use bugs have been trending up. This is likely partially attributed to more researchers being interested in this vulnerability class and writing great tools to help identify these issues.\r\n\r\n> - **Between 2017 and 2018, uninitialized memory vulnerabilities have accounted for roughly 5-10% of the CVE’s issued by Microsoft.**\r\n> - There is a near equal split between stack based vulnerabilities and heap/pool based vulnerabilities.\r\n> - Uninitialized memory disclosures outweigh uninitialized memory use bugs.\r\n\r\n> A zero initialization results in:\r\n>\r\n> - NULL pointer, will throw an SEH exception if you dereference it on Windows (i.e., denial of service at worst instead of remote code execution) which will typically crash the program.\r\n> - A zero size, or zero index, if that is what the variable is being used to track. This is expected to minimize the impact of an uninitialized size being passed to a function like memcpy that operates on a buffer based on the size passed.\r\n> - A zero pointer, when tested in a NULL check, will take the path of “the pointer is NULL” and not attempt to use the pointer. This at least gives the program the chance of correctly handling the developer forgetting to initialize the pointer (since following a pattern-initialization pointer will always crash).\r\n> - A zero Boolean is false which may indicate “failure”.\r\n\r\n> Our peers at Google have done some measurements and proven that on Clang, zero initialization is currently measurably better in code size and runtime performance than pattern initialization.\r\n\r\n> This exposes another benefit of zero initialization: More deterministic results. The initialization cost doesn’t depend on if a particular global variable is in the L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, paged out, etc.\r\n\r\n> Windows 10 1903 was the first version of Windows to ship with InitAll enabled (shipped Spring 2019). We haven’t had any performance complaints arise related to InitAll since shipping it.\r\n\r\n> **Since shipping InitAll to the world, we’ve had multiple vulnerability reports submitted to MSRC that did not reproduce on the latest versions of Windows due to InitAll. This effectively downgrades the vulnerabilities from “security bugs” to “code defect that currently has no negative impacts”. This means we no longer need to ship a security update for the in-market operating systems that have the mitigation installed, saving customers patching pain and Microsoft servicing pain.**\r\n\r\n> We do still fix the issues in our active development branches so that the code is correct going forward and we fix in-market operating systems that don’t have InitAll enabled as they are still vulnerable. Over the long term, operating systems that don’t have InitAll enabled will fall out of support. Once this occurs, uninitialized memory bugs that are mitigated by InitAll will only need to be fixed in active development branches and this bug class will no longer need to be serviced to in-market operating systems.\r\n\r\n> Longer term we are exploring if it’s possible to eliminate these sorts of issues from the C and C++ language in a standardized way. Leaving variables uninitialized is not typically necessary for performance (especially when the compiler has good redundant store elimination). Instead of defaulting variables to uninitialized, it’d be nice to default to “variable must be provably initialized before use” and only allow this rule to be broken if a special uninitialized keyword was used. This could allow developers to keep performance while also saving themselves from unnecessary mistakes.\r\n\r\ntl;dr in clickbait form: \"Black hats hate him: the one weird trick that saved millions of users from losing heaps of money due to nasty memory vulnerabilities!\"",
