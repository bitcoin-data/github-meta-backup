    "title": "Multiplication vs Division",
    "body": "I was reading about multiplication being faster than division in C++: https://stackoverflow.com/a/17883577/\r\n\r\n99% of the regular contributors in this repository know C++ better than me so I think this must have already been discussed or considered while doing calculations although I couldn't find anything in [doc/developer-notes.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md)\r\n\r\nDivision is done at lot of places which could be replaced with multiplication. Are there any downsides? \r\n\r\nExample: `GetMinFee()` in [src/txmempool.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fdd80b0a53b4af0b29cb6e03118e2456d053a757/src/txmempool.cpp#L1080)\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nCFeeRate CTxMemPool::GetMinFee(size_t sizelimit) const {\r\n    LOCK(cs);\r\n    if (!blockSinceLastRollingFeeBump || rollingMinimumFeeRate == 0)\r\n        return CFeeRate(llround(rollingMinimumFeeRate));\r\n\r\n    int64_t time = GetTime();\r\n    if (time > lastRollingFeeUpdate + 10) {\r\n        double halflife = ROLLING_FEE_HALFLIFE;\r\n-        if (DynamicMemoryUsage() < sizelimit / 4)\r\n+        if (DynamicMemoryUsage() < sizelimit * 0.25)\r\n-            halflife /= 4;\r\n+            halflife *= 0.25;\r\n-        else if (DynamicMemoryUsage() < sizelimit / 2)\r\n+        else if (DynamicMemoryUsage() < sizelimit * 0.5)\r\n-            halflife /= 2;\r\n+           halflife *= 0.5;\r\n\r\n        rollingMinimumFeeRate = rollingMinimumFeeRate / pow(2.0, (time - lastRollingFeeUpdate) / halflife);\r\n        lastRollingFeeUpdate = time;\r\n\r\n-        if (rollingMinimumFeeRate < (double)incrementalRelayFee.GetFeePerK() / 2) {\r\n+        if (rollingMinimumFeeRate < (double)incrementalRelayFee.GetFeePerK() * 0.5) {\r\n            rollingMinimumFeeRate = 0;\r\n            return CFeeRate(0);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return std::max(CFeeRate(llround(rollingMinimumFeeRate)), incrementalRelayFee);\r\n}\r\n```",

      "body": "What you read is right, and it's not restricted to C++. **CPUs** are significantly slower at division than multiplication. However, the issue only applies when you're dividing by a variable.\r\n\r\nWhenever you're dividing by a constant that's known at compile time, the compiler will just convert it to a multiplication at optimization time, similar to what you're doing by hand here.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, some of the cases you're highlighting are divisions by an integer; you can't replace them by a multiplication with a floating point number (the result will be a different data type). It **is** possible to convert integer division by a constant to something faster as well, but it's a little more complicated (depending on the situation, it may involve multiplications, shifts, or a combination of the two).\r\n\r\nLastly, none of the cases you point out are performance critical. It's better to focus optimization efforts on places where it matters.",
