      "body": "@laanwj I decided to go with letting the account pay the fee and reimbursing, but I observed something a little bit troubling.  When I did my move the account I was reimbursing came up to 0, but the account I was reimbursing from didn't change.\n\nMy accounts\n\n```\n>>> r.listaccounts()\n[u'', u'testing', u'user_account_6', u'user_account_5']\n```\n\nMy move request\n\n```\n>>> [r.getbalance(x) for x in r.listaccounts()]\n[Decimal('0.00650000'), Decimal('0E-8'), Decimal('0E-8'), Decimal('-0.00050000')]\n>>> r.move('', 'user_account_5', 0.0005)\nTrue\n>>> [r.getbalance(x) for x in r.listaccounts()]\n[Decimal('0.00650000'), Decimal('0E-8'), Decimal('0E-8'), Decimal('0E-8')]\n```\n\nIt is troubling to me that the sum of all accounts after doing the reimbursement move is 0.0005 higher than the sum before doing the move.  The interesting thing is that my default account with the balance of 0.0065 before the move is the one that was wrong according to my external transaction log table.\n\nThe move command to reimburse actually created the transactions inside the bitcoind database so that a sum of all transactions in the '' account matched getbalance('') which indicates to me that getbalance('') may not be relying on the transaction tables alone for its calculation.\n\nBased on this it would appear as if the reimbursement step is required for accounting sanity purposes which makes me wish all the more that there were a way to set an account for transaction fees to be charged against when calling sendfrom so as to avoid reimbursement and the accounting oddities I have noted around that (or the oddities when a reimbursement isn't made).\n",
