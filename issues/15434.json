    "title": "Querying DNS seeds too frequently",
    "body": "Despite being running most of the time, and having a database of tens of thousands of peers, my node seems to query the DNS seeds each time I restart it, which doesn't seem ideal from a privacy perspective?\r\n\r\neg from my debug.log:\r\n\r\n    2018-10-25T18:03:51Z Loaded 70360 addresses from peers.dat  172ms\r\n    2018-10-25T18:04:02Z Loading addresses from DNS seeds (could take a while)\r\n    2018-10-28T23:00:06Z Loaded 70368 addresses from peers.dat  153ms\r\n    2018-10-28T23:00:17Z Loading addresses from DNS seeds (could take a while)\r\n    2018-11-18T21:06:11Z Loaded 70033 addresses from peers.dat  1105ms\r\n    2018-11-18T21:06:22Z Loading addresses from DNS seeds (could take a while)\r\n    2018-12-19T06:37:23Z Loaded 71275 addresses from peers.dat  1953ms\r\n    2018-12-19T06:37:34Z Loading addresses from DNS seeds (could take a while)\r\n    2018-12-27T08:03:36Z Loaded 71670 addresses from peers.dat  1259ms\r\n    2018-12-27T08:03:47Z Loading addresses from DNS seeds (could take a while)\r\n    2019-02-18T08:46:48Z Loaded 70040 addresses from peers.dat  165ms\r\n    2019-02-18T08:46:59Z Loading addresses from DNS seeds (could take a while)\r\n\r\nI think this is due to (1) many of the peers in my peers.dat not being alive, which means that (2) most outgoing connection attempts fail and stall for 5 seconds (nConnectTimeout), so (3) since the DNS seed thread waits for 11 seconds, only 3 or 4 attempts are generally made, with only 0 or 1 peers successfully connecting, so the threshold of 2 or more relevant peers isn't reached.\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to increase the DNS threads sleep time correspondingly? Something like:\r\n\r\n    -        if (!interruptNet.sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(11)))\r\n    +        if (!interruptNet.sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(nConnectTimeout * 7)))\r\n\r\nperhaps?",

I also added a LogPrintf in ThreadOpenConnections() to report outgoing connection attempts; duplicates a -debug=net log messasge, but was less noisy for quick debugging.\r\n\r\nI'm getting maybe 20% of outbound attempts succeeding, which if my maths isn't too far off says 8 attempts should be ~50% chance of 2 connections, 18 attempts should give 90% chance, 31 for 99%, and 40 for 99.9%. Though having now tried stopping and restarting a few times in quick succession, I'm getting higher success rates.\r\n\r\nMight be better to run a few extra threads that just try to connect to previously seen peers at startup to get reconnected to the network faster?",
