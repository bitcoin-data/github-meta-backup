    "title": "Implement bip69 (Lexicographical Indexing of Transaction Inputs and Outputs)",
    "body": "[BIP69](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki) is a pretty under appreciated bip that defines a standard ordering for transactions inputs / outputs.\r\n\r\nThere's quite a few obvious advantages to the approach, like making it easy to verify correctness, or making it easier to write unit tests. But I think the most important aspect is it helps users verify their wallet isn't maliciously leaking information. Granted a malicious wallet could try leak information via the nonces, deterministic signing helps make that detectible with access to the private keys.\r\n\r\nAs some wallets have already moved to bip69 (and unlikely to consider moving back) it would be very beneficial if core moves in the same direction resulting in better transaction uniformity for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n(And a bounty for fun: if this is merged in the next 3 months I'll offer 0.03 BTC to the author :D)",

From the BIP:\r\n\r\n> While out of scope of this BIP, protocols that do require a specified order of inputs/outputs (e.g. due to use of SIGHASH_SINGLE) should consider the goals of this BIP and how best to adapt them to the specific needs of those protocols.\r\n\r\n> the most important aspect is it helps users verify their wallet isn't maliciously leaking information\r\n\r\nCompromised wallets can do all sorts of damage. I think a more important aspect is blending in with other wallets.",

      "body": "> As long as most wallets don't comply with BIP69, (which will be the case for like forever,) input and output shuffling results in superior privacy.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I can agree. I hope we can agree on two basic ideas:\r\n* The status-quo is harmful -- it allows for (messy) clustering of transaction origins. Which among other things can be used to further increase the accuracy of estimates if outputs are change or not\r\n* Certain wallets require the determinism that bip69 offers, while for other wallets it doesn't matter\r\n\r\nWhich I think leads to the logical conclusion that moving to (something like) bip69 is the smart thing -- even for wallets (perhaps like core) that don't really care too much about it. \r\n\r\nIf you are worried that core switching to bip69 could reduce privacy (which I don't think is a big concern, as several big wallets already are using bip69), there is an easy solution: it can slowly be phased in (e.g. seed a random number generator with the hash of the first priv key, then with a X% chance use bip69 or shuffle with inputs/outputs with the rng).\r\n\r\n> Of course testing it requires a bit more effort, but should you make your software worse so to save 10 lines of testing code?\r\n\r\nTesting improvements really is one of the smallest benefits of bip69, but you are really underselling it. For a wallet that uses bip69, if a transaction is ever created that doesn't conform -- then it's immediately obvious. You don't nearly have the same benefit with shuffled inputs/outputs -- where it would be very easy to have a wallet or code path that doesn't shuffle without anyone realizing.",
