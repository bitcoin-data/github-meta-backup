    "body": "As discussed on #bitcoin-dev it happens that a large number of Bitcoin has been lost by users misunderstanding the gravity of the situation when playing with private keys. Online tutorials encourage users to use the `importprivkey` and `dumpprivkey` commands in general situations, leading to cases where they unwittingly erase their wallets or otherwise compromise them (private key to QR code websites were mentioned). \n\nI propose that large warnings are given when executing these commands from the RPC console to attempt to give the user a sense of how much risk is involved in this action. A gate that requires a clickthrough or a written out message \"I understand how dangerous this is\" would do. More radically the commands could be removed altogether or hidden when a switch is not given at startup time.\n\nRelevant discussions can be found in the logs for the development channel for half an hour ago.\n",

      "body": "I am a strong advocate for making them type out the warning message, rather than letting them click through it. I think this is the only way to get them to actually read it.\n\nI think the contents should be as explicit as possible, to reduce people's ability to convince themselves that they know better.\n\nA lot of footgun issues happen when people import/export keys, use them for some operation, and then delete the wallet; I think a warning specifically advising that \"DELETING ANY WALLET, EVEN AN APPARENTLY EMPTY WALLET, IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND LIKELY TO CAUSE LOSS OF COINS\" could _potentially_ help.\n\n(But not every footgun issue involves deleting a perceived-to-be-empty wallet; there's also the issue of exporting a privkey and handing it to an untrusted party. And any tutorial that advises doing that is probably malicious rather than stupid, which means any gate we add, the tutorial will explicitly instruct the user to bypass or ignore. So that's a harder issue than the one above.)\n",

After talking with @josibake it seems like we would need to implement this change at the RPC level and then within each `dangerous` request and abort the command if this header/flag (for the CLI) doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/adam2k/bitcoin/tree/4176-privkey-warning\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent commits, I was planning on implementing:\r\n\r\n1. The addition of this cURL header when using the `-allowdangerous` flag within the CLI.\r\n2. Checks within the `importprivkey`, `dumpprivkey`, `listdescriptors` and  `importdescriptors` for `if (!allowDangerous) // abort the command`\r\n\r\nIf this seems like a decent plan then I'll continue, but let me know if this is way off base.",

The only effect is adding one step to the development of such software.\r\n\r\nI would argue an RPC is either dangerous or not, regardless of who calls it. If an RPC is dangerous, I think that logic should live in the RPC itself (not a client) and be applied regardless of the caller. By doing this through the RPC interface, we are communicating to software writers, `bitcoin-cli` users, users writing cURL commands, and any future client that these RPCs are dangerous and extra care should be taken. I don't think there is much difference between requiring a user to add an extra flag vs adding an extra step to software development. The goal is to communicate \"here be dragons.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, I think modeling the logic in the RPC interface provides a cleaner way of communicating to all clients \"hey, in this new release, we are marking X RPC as dangerous and potentially deprecating it in the future.\" If we instead model this logic in one specific client (`bitcoin-cli`), there are likely many other clients who would benefit from knowing they are using dangerous RPCs but would be unaware.\r\n\r\nIf the worry is we will create a bunch of extra work for software already calling these dangerous RPCs, we could add a config option to `bitcoind` to bypass danger warnings (`-allowdangerousrpcs`) which is off by default. This at least requires the node operator to explicitly state they are fine with clients doing dangerous stuff.",

      "body": "Ah, yes. Thanks @josibake! I forgot to add the part about the config override in the previous comment. It's a little extra work for the 3rd party software developers, but that'll be a lot easier than adding the flag to every one of these \"dangerous\" requests.\r\n\r\n@sipa I understand the annoyance for the developers of the other software.  This is the safest approach though if we are trying to prevent a footgun situation (for example, image software logging `dumpprivkey` in a CI pipeline in a 3rd party solution like Datadog.  They would not be willing to delete logs like this.) and because this is for legacy wallets I would think something like this is understandable by 3rd party developers.\r\n\r\nI'm going to proceed as planned and I'll open up a PR this week for further comments.",

It feels a little brittle because of the ordering of the params seems to be required for this to work.  For example, if the command looks something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Case 1:\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey \"${SOME_KEY}\" dangerous\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n// From my debugger:\r\n(const std::vector<std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >, std::allocator<std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > > > &) args = size=2: {\r\n  [0] = \"${OMITTED_KEY}\"\r\n  [1] = \"dangerous\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nvs.\r\n\r\n## Case 2:\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey dangerous \"${SOME_KEY}\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n// From my debugger:\r\n\r\n(const std::vector<std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >, std::allocator<std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > > > &) args = size=2: {\r\n  [0] = \"dangerous\"\r\n  [1] = \"${OMITTED_KEY}\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe two commands have different array locations and in the second case, I believe this would fail because `dangerous` is not a valid private key.  Where this seems to break down for me is that we need to enforce this on a command by command basis.  So all of the requests are need this `dangerous` flag might have varied vector locations to check.  It seems like this would add a lot of cruft to the codebase unnecessarily.  Am I missing something that makes the management of the params easier?\r\n\r\nMaybe the answer is we go with this idea as-is and require some long term follow up work to overhaul the architecture of the CLI at some point to clean up these rough edges?",

      "body": "> @ryanofsky I went through your PR and tried applying the same concepts to this issue. It feels a little brittle because of the ordering of the params seems to be required for this to work.\r\n\r\nSorry, I was trying to suggest passing it as a named-parameter like `bitcoin-cli -named dumpprivkey danger=true` instead of as a positional argument. I agree positional arguments can be brittle. #26485 would improve on #19762 in this respect because it could require the argument to be passed by name, not position.",
