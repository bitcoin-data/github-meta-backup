    "title": "rpc listunspent should expose \"is_mine\" and \"replaceable\"",
    "body": "Currently `listunspent` only exposes a `safe` which is coded roughly as `confirmations > 0 || (is_mine && !replaceable)` however a consumer very well might want to distinguish between when it's \"mine\" and when it's not (as I presently need to).\r\n\r\nThis ideally would be extended to listunspent, gettransaction and listtransactions. \r\n\r\n(The `listtransactions` already exposes a \"trusted\" which is basically \"is_mine\" but also uses the spendZeroConf  configuration, which is imho rather confusing. So my suggestion would be that all apis expose a consistent set of \"is_mine\", \"replaceable\" and \"confirmations\" (which is already always exposed) and RPC consumers can use these primitives to make decisions.\r\n",

I suspect \"are all inputs mine\" to generally be more useful,  but it might not be worth the trouble of doing that if that's not easily accessible. If \"is_mine\" just means \"one of the inputs is mine\", I'd suggest keeping that behavior and if needed in the future create an \"is_all_mine\" or something\r\n\r\n> I'm confused. Isn't everything reported by listunspent by definition is_mine?\r\n\r\nHmm not really. listunspent lists all your shit, but you want to know about the source of it.  Consider there two common ways for you to get money: someone sends it to you (not is_mine) or you sent to yourself (i.e. change) and it (is_mine). It makes sense to distinguish these two cases for a variety of things.\r\n\r\nIn my particular case, I do coin-selection outside of core  (I call \"listunspent\" then do coin selection, and generate a transaction) so knowing the source of the unspent is pretty important (as core itself does in it's own coin selection, for example)",
