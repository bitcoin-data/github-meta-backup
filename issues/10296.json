    "title": "Network Traffic graph displays errenous traffic spikes",
    "body": "### Describe the issue\r\n**First Issue**\r\nIn Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 the Network Traffic graph in the Debug window displays erroneous traffic spikes when synchronizing the block chain. My internet connection is limited to 50 mega**bit**/sec downstream yet the bursts are over 10 mega**bytes**/sec, approximately twice the bandwidth that  my internet connection should be capable of. Although theoretically my internal network could be buffering this traffic and sending it as a burst, these theoretical traffic bursts are not seen by the operating system's Task Manager or Resource Monitor applications therefor I believe it is safe to rule this out as the cause.\r\n\r\n**Second Issue**\r\nWhen you press the Clear button in the Network Traffic graph, and no network activity is taking place, it will not render a graphic for the graph. After a period of time when network traffic does take place it will render a flat line followed by a graph of the traffic\r\n\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\n#### If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:\r\n**First Issue**\r\nReplicate the environment, begin to download the block chain and watch the traffic graph window for hours. I'm sure you could save yourself a lot of time by doing this programmatically and have your code look for traffic spikes which would exceed the available internet bandwidth.\r\n\r\n**Second Issue**\r\nReplication the environment, begin to download the block chain, wait for a period of no network traffic, press the clear button, wait for network traffic to resume.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n**First Issue**\r\nThe network graph should display accurate traffic statistics.\r\n\r\n**Second Issue**\r\nThe network graph should display a flat line during periods of no traffic\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n**First Issue**\r\nThere are erroneous traffic spikes.\r\n\r\n**Second Issue**\r\nA flat line is not displayed until traffic occurs after the graph has been cleared.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots.\r\n**First Issue**\r\nPlease be aware that there is also iSCSI and Remote Desktop Services traffic accounted for in the Task Manager/Resource Monitor graphs. Even with this extra traffic, Task Manager/Resource Monitor does not display the same 10+ megabyte/sec traffic spikes.\r\nVideo of it happening with Task Manager - https://my.mixtape.moe/ugszqy.mp4\r\nScreenshot of it happening with Resource Monitor:\r\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-28 at 5 04 59 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3067075/25549689/071638c0-2c39-11e7-8925-5e103c5c00f1.png\">\r\n\r\n**Second Issue**\r\nVideo of it happening - https://my.mixtape.moe/gcazhi.mp4\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.14.0\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Windows Server 2016 Remote Desktop Services Session Host virtual machine with Bitcoin Core configured as a RemoteApp on a VMware ESXi 6.5 host\r\n- CPU: 4 cores from a dual Xeon E5-2660v2 with high latency sensitivity and 100% resource reservations\r\n- RAM: 4GB with 100% resource reservations\r\n- Disk size: OS/Bitcoin Core 32GB, data directory 1TB\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD): OS/Bitcoin Core is stored on the host as a VMDK on a 8x SSD RAID 0 VMFS6 datastore, the data directory is a thin provisioned LUN on a Microsoft iSCSI target server 2016 failover cluster running deduplication stored on the host as a VMDK on a 8x HDD RAID 6 VMFS5 datastore.\r\n- Network: Cable Modem->Cisco ASA 5510 firewall->Two Cisco Aironet 1141 802.11n (2.4Ghz) APs configured as a workgroup bridge->Cisco Catalyst 3750E switch->ESXi host with a Intel X520 NIC as the uplinks for the VDS port group->VM with a VMXNET3 network adapter\r\n\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\nDebug.log - https://my.mixtape.moe/fczubf.zip\r\n\r\n\r\n",
