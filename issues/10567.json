      "body": "There is no such thing as abandoning a transaction in Bitcoin, once its created, it could be confirmed by a miner at any point, however, if you wish to cancel a transaction, you can manually double spend it and create a conflicting transaction with a higher fee, which, if mined, would make it impossible to confirm the previous one. There are lots of guides on manually double spending a transaction in Core if you look around for them.\r\n\r\n(The abandon option is only available if the transaction created doesn't even make it into your own mempool, which is usually a good indication that the rest of the network also doesnt see the transaction).",
