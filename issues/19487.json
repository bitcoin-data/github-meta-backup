In the meantime: I backup the Bitcoin blockchain (on Ubuntu Linux) without stopping bitcoind every month on my server (basically) like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-0.20.0/src/bitcoin-cli savemempool\r\nrsync -L --delete -av \".bitcoin/\" /media/external/.bitcoin\r\nrsync -L --delete -av \".bitcoin/\" /media/external/.bitcoin\r\nrsync -L --delete -av \".bitcoin/\" /media/external/.bitcoin\r\nrsync -L --delete -av \".bitcoin/\" /media/external/.bitcoin\r\n```\r\nUsually rsync doesn't do anything anymore for the last 2 executions. I then run bitcoin-qt on a different computer (but you could run it on your server too) like this (connecting only to my own bitcoind):\r\n`bitcoin-qt -connect=192.168.178.20 -blocksonly=1 -listen=0 -datadir=/media/external/.bitcoin`\r\n\r\nBitcoin-qt always repairs the blockchain without problems and this way you'll know if the backup was successful. You can even stop bitcoin-qt cleanly and run it again.\r\n",
