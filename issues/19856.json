    "title": "Some transactions are not shown in listtransactions output",
    "body": "\r\nI have two bitcoin core full nodes. I have one wallet.dat file on both nodes. One node is a master and second node is a reserve. Master signs and sends transactions. Reserve node only receives updates from network. I create new addresses on the master node only and the reserve node derives the same addresses.\r\n\r\nI don’t use any other commands on the reserve node. The reserve node creates addresses automatically after receiving a transaction to a new address. This process is possible due to using BIP32 key derivation from one master key.\r\n\r\nSo, I have constantly synchronized master and reserve nodes. If there are problems with the master, then I switch to the reserve.\r\n\r\nI see some strange behavior appear during this process. Some transactions are not shown in the `listtransactions` output. I did a research an found that only \"in-wallet\" transactions are not shown in the `listransactions`. The \"in-wallet\" transactions are transactions that were sent with sender’s and receiver’s keys, which are stored in my wallet. I also found that new addresses on the reserve node are created whithout a label.\r\n\r\nAfter adding a label to the address the problem is gone. But adding a label requires additional steps I want to avoid.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nResults of `listtransactions` also shown \"in-wallet\" transactions to addresses without labels\r\n\r\n\r\n**Current Behavior**\r\n\r\nResults of `listtransactions` doesn’t shown \"in-wallet\" transactions to addresses without labels\r\n\r\n**Possible Solution**\r\n\r\n- Automatic adding of a default label to the addresses, derived to the reserve node.\r\n\r\n- Print transactions sent to addresses without labels in `listtransactions`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1.  Run and sync full nodes A and B.\r\n\r\n2.  Stop nodes A and B.\r\n\r\n3.  Copy wallet.dat from node A to node B.\r\n\r\n4.  Run nodes A and B\r\n\r\n5.  Use `getnewaddress` method on node A 10 times. Let’s assume the 10-th address is `$ADDRESS`.\r\n\r\n6.  Use `sendtoaddress` method on node A. Send 0.001 coins from another address to the `$ADDRESS`. `bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress $ADDRESS 0.001`. Let’s assume the result txid is `$TXID`.\r\n\r\n7.  Use `listtransaction \"*\"` method on node B. You don’t see the `$TXID` transaction in list.\r\n\r\n8.  Use `gettransactions`, or `listunspent` methods on node B. You can see the transaction details. Wallet balance changed on node B and is equal to node A.\r\n\r\n9.  Use `getaddressinfo $ADDRESS` method on node A. You can see that address had the default label (`\"\"`).\r\n\r\n10. Use `getaddressinfo $ADDRESS` method on node B. You can see that the address doesn’t have any label.\r\n\r\n**Context (Environment)**\r\n\r\nThe problem is occured on any version of bitcoin core testnet and mainnet. The problem is also occured on litecoin and any bitcoin-based coins.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "It looks like this is primarily due to how change detection works. Essentially, outputs that go to the wallet are detected as change, because, by definition, that is what change is. So your send-to-self transactions do not appear in `listtransactions` because they are being detected as change.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is not advised to have the same wallet loaded in multiple places as you get unexpected behavior like what you are seeing. A lot of the wallet's change detection functionality is based on user actions within the wallet (like requesting addresses), and so it can kind of break when you have a wallet where the user isn't interacting with it directly (i.e. node B).",
