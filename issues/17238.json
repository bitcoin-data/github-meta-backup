Thus the `0172` part is the `CPubKey`. It deserialises without error (no `std::ios_base::failure` is thrown).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCPubKey pk1;\r\nCDataStream s1{std::vector<uint8_t>{'\\x01', '\\x72'}, SER_NETWORK, INIT_PROTO_VERSION};\r\ns1 >> pk1;\r\n\r\nCDataStream s2{SER_NETWORK, INIT_PROTO_VERSION};\r\ns2 << pk1;\r\n\r\nCPubKey pk2;\r\ns2 >> pk2;\r\n\r\nassert(pk1 == pk2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssertion `pk1 == pk2' failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any reason to why `CPubKey` is deviating from the other serializable classes (for which equality is defined) in this regard? :)",

From a fuzzing perspective it very nice to have a set of general (non-class dependent) invariants we can check.\r\n\r\nThese are the naïve assumptions I have been making:\r\n* `std::ios_base::failure` is the only exception expected to be thrown when serialising or deserialising -- judging from my fuzzing results this seems to hold for all classes\r\n* `Deserialize<T>(Serialize(obj)) == obj` for all `T obj` (assuming `T::operator==` and that `std::ios_base::failure` is not thrown during `Deserialize`/`Serialize`) -- judging from my fuzzing results this seems to hold for all classes with the exception of `CPubKey` :)\r\n\r\nDo these sound reasonable? More invariants worth checking? :)",
