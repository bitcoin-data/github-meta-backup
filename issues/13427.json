    "body": "Maybe this exists and didn't see it in the docs but is there a way to get txhash ZMQ notices just for wallet-affecting TXes?\r\n\r\nIf not I guess this is a feature request. I saw a request for JSON-encoded ZMQ notices that was shot down that was pretty good with the official answer being to decode the raw TX or use RPC, I think this would be great for the latter since it would cut down on the number of RPC calls greatly.\r\n",
