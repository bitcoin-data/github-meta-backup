    "body": "### Describe the issue\r\n\r\nI need to investigate a bit more, but I just completed a fresh sync from scratch using master, and I noticed some odd behavior with the stalling logic.\r\n\r\nI was initially connected to 8 outbound peers (and no others), and then to speed up the sync, I decided to addnode an instance on my local network that was caught up.  So in particular, block transfer times to this new node were very quick.\r\n\r\nWhat was unusual was that even though this machine fast, it was getting disconnected repeatedly during IBD for stalling (it would then get readded, since addnode'd it).  I started to look through my debug log to see what was going on, and it appears to me that it may have been something like this:\r\n\r\n- Some other peer X is stalling, gets disconnected.\r\n- Connect to some new peer Y.\r\n- X's blocks get assigned to other peers, maybe the local one.\r\n- If we're near the end of the download window, then because Y is available not downloading any blocks, the peer that was reassigned X's block has 1 second (?) to provide the block, or else that peer is stalling.\r\n\r\nSo it looked to me like I'd go through periods of time where everyone was getting disconnected for stalling, such as this particularly egregious example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:52 UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000003085d45701cef706396618d68bea4b9551b7442b031d1863 height=313019 version=0x00000002 log2_work=79.946856 tx=43453816 date='2014-07-29 15:40:42' progress=0.218633 cache\r\n=1581.8MiB(3793192tx)\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:54 Peer=290 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:56 Peer=282 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:58 Peer=291 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:06 Peer=292 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:08 Peer=286 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:11 Peer=293 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:15 Peer=294 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:17 Peer=295 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:19 Peer=296 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:21 Peer=297 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:23 Peer=298 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:28 Peer=299 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:30 Peer=300 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:32 Peer=301 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:35 Peer=302 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:37 Peer=303 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:39 Peer=304 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:41 Peer=305 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:43 Peer=306 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:45 Peer=307 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:48 Peer=309 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:51 Peer=310 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:53 Peer=311 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:55 Peer=312 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:57 Peer=313 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:59 UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000001291028bceab2639c12c762be3988017cba99fa792b460c4 height=313020 version=0x00000002 log2_work=79.946955 tx=43454953 date='2014-07-29 15:45:18' progress=0.218647 cache=1581.8MiB(3793020tx)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: forgot to mention that the above snippet is from me grepping for \"stalling|UpdateTip\" in my debug.log, so the new connections that happened in between those stalling messages aren't shown.",

      "body": "#9337 shows some additional debug which may help here. Esssentially the current timeout logic is completely ignoring the fact that blocks are being downloaded, albeit more slowly than expected, and the current timeout on stallers is only 2 seconds - i.e. if it remains the node that is being waited on for more than 2 seconds (which is very likely) it gets disconnected. What is needed is extra logic to determine the speed of each peer and factor this in to the number of blocks being requested from each peer. I wrote code back in 2012 which did this, but it wasn't up to the standards needed to get it merged. (probably \"layer violations\").\r\n\r\nWithout the logic I am suggesting then it is often likely that nodes will become staller nodes. Part of the problem is that blocks are not \"striped\" amongst nodes, but instead are tasked with a bunch of consequtive blocks which makes occurrence of \"staller nodes\" far more likely.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is that when the node starts up , as soon as it has calculated how many blocks behind it is, it works out how to spread these blocks over the nodes it will download them from. E.g. if it will be downlaoding from 6 peers, then it could skip 5 blocks for block height it requests from each node. This could be the initial logic, but if there is a lot to download, additional logic would also factor in the speed of each connection.",

      "body": "I'm running v0.20.1 and performing mainnet IBD over Tor. This issue keeps occurring for me intermittently. It does eventually stop on its own, but keeps resurfacing:\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n~~I think I managed to \"resolve\" the issue, although I'm not sure that what I did should be necessary to prevent this.~~\r\nI realized a similarity between my configuration and sdaftuar's: We both had `addnodes` configured.\r\nThe difference is mine were added because my node was configured to only connect over Tor, and needed .onion seeds.\r\n~~After removing the seeds from bitcoin.conf and relaunching, the intermittent batches of stalling errors seem to have completely stopped.~~\r\n\r\n**Edit 2:**\r\nRemoving the `addnodes` did not resolve the issue, but it does stop the node from connecting to the _same_ peers again right  after it just disconnected them (which would delay recovery).\r\n\r\nLog output looks identical every time: UpdateTip stops, eventually all peers stall and get disconnected, new set of peers connect, UpdateTip resumes (for however long until the issue resurfaces).\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020-12-30T03:44:33Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000397ed285257b8eae9d557e7e98f2781ebdc47669e79f37 height=505292 version=0x20000000 log2_work=87.924262 tx=294245342

      "body": "I have experienced this too recently on a not very fast connection:\r\n\r\nI think the issue is (as partly described above) that when we have exhausted the download window because of a legitimate slow peer that stalls, we disconnect them for stalling and assign the required block to another peer - that peer will get marked as a possible staller almost immediately and has 2 seconds (`BLOCK_STALLING_TIMEOUT`) to deliver a block or it will get disconnected too.\r\n\r\nWhen our connection is not so fast (so that a block will take more than 2 seconds to arrive) this can lead to several subsequent disconnects.\r\n\r\nThis will self-correct in many cases where our connection would be fast enough to download a block in 2s in isolation, but not fast enough when simultaneously downloading other blocks from up to 9 other outbound peers - so when the other peers either get disconnected or have sent us all of the blocks assigned to them, it would be possible to catch up again - but this still leads to churn - good and fast peers are being disconnected just because our own connection is not fast enough, which seems not ideal.\r\n\r\nAs for possible solutions: Just raising `BLOCK_STALLING_TIMEOUT` moderately might be possible (and might be justified by the increasing physical block sizes after Segwit), but comes at the cost of making IBD slower for high-bandwidth nodes by waiting longer before disconnecting a legitimate staller. \r\nMaybe it could make sense to have `BLOCK_STALLING_TIMEOUT` adjusted dynamically based on past averaged times to download blocks?",

      "body": "I recently spent a lot of time looking into this issue because I've noticed my IBD performance drop significantly year over year. While I haven't found a smoking gun, I do believe there's room for improvement in this stalling logic.\r\n\r\nMy findings: https://blog.lopp.net/is-bitcoin-network-slowing-down/\r\n\r\nOne key takeaway regarding the 2 second timeout: A full block is over 8 megabits of data which means the new peer needs to send it faster than 4 megabits per second. But according to Bitnodes' peer bandwidth stats, 96% of reachable IPV4 peers are slower than 4 megabits per second! So it's easy to see how your node could get stuck in a \"stalled peer\" loop for a minute while it desperately cycles through peers trying to find one that's faster than 4 Mbps.",
