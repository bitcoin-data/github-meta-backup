    "title": "Finding peers to connect to after -onlynet changes may be problematic",
    "body": "**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core, ideally, should always have peers to try to connect to just like when started for the very first time (empty `peers.dat`). It should not be more difficult to find possible peers if it was ran before with a different `-onlynet=` setting.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nIf addrman has some entries, even to only unreachable networks, due to previous runs and changes in `-onlynet`, then the fixed seeds will not be used.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun with `-onlynet=ipv4`, change to `-onlynet=i2p`.\r\n\r\n**To fix**\r\n\r\nThis problem is two-fold:\r\n\r\n1. Fixed seeds should be used if we have 0 reachable peers in addrman. I guess this condition should be relaxed, like discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678#issuecomment-1238542029\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc44d1796e4df5824423d7d13de3082fe204db7d/src/net.cpp#L1628\r\n\r\n2. Even if there are a few reachable peers in addrman, e.g. 0.1% it will take a long time before they are tried. The address selection logic can be improved. It is, simplified, like this (see lines [1797](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc44d1796e4df5824423d7d13de3082fe204db7d/src/net.cpp#L1797) and [1810](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc44d1796e4df5824423d7d13de3082fe204db7d/src/net.cpp#L1810)):\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect random address\r\nif not reachable then try another random address\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan be improved to \"select random address, but only from reachable networks\".\r\n\r\nThis problem is amplified by the fact that we do not save non-reachable addresses in addrman during p2p gossip (and also see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678). Maybe we should reconsider that as a 3rd fixup, in addition to the above 2 - save even unreachable addresses in addrman during p2p gossip and fixed seeds loadup? What is the worst that can happen? We will have some wasted space in addrman if `onlynet` is never altered?",

We do regardless of the address of the recipient, i.e. we could gossip I2P address to IPv4 peer (we do not know if that IPv4 peer has I2P connectivity or not)\r\n1.2. If the address being gossiped is of unreachable network (from our point of view), then we [gossip it less](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a9ffebddbe7d3e5a21f8c794dc1c61ceb649f345/src/net_processing.cpp#L2042-L2043)\r\n2.
