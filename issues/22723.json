    "body": "Hello, I hava only one pc and I make the bitcoin in wsl on my pc.\r\nI just want to create multiple bitcoin nodes in my pc. I have read [this](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/52267/connecting-two-local-nodes-in-regtest?r=SearchResults,) but failed too.\r\nSo would you please tell me how to solve it? thank you.\r\n\r\nI am so sorry maybe I mislead you above  . Actually, my aim is to create a private chain with multiple bitcoin nodes which can connect themselves in WSL on my only one PC. When one of these nodes mine a  block and this guy  can broadcast it to other nodes  then other nodes begin to try to mine next block on my PC and this is my aim. \r\nBy the way, the WSL is Windows Subsystem for Linux.\r\nHence, would you please tell me how to solve it? thank you.",

I have read this but failed too.\r\nSo would you please tell me how to solve it? thank you.\r\n\r\nFollow the below steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create two directories (Node1 and Node2) and `bitcoin.conf` files in D: and E:\r\n\r\n   _D:\\Node1\\bitcoin.conf_\r\n   ```\r\n     \r\n   regtest.rpcport=18222\r\n   rpcuser=user1\r\n   rpcpassword=password1\r\n   ```\r\n   _E:\\Node2\\bitcoin.conf_\r\n   ```\r\n      \r\n   regtest.rpcport=18666\r\n   rpcuser=user2\r\n   rpcpassword=password2\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Once you run `make install DESTDIR=/mnt/c/workspace/bitcoin` mentioned in [doc/build-windows.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md), it will save the binaries in `C:\\workspace\\bitcoin\\bin\\`\r\n3. Open 2 PowerShell sessions and run the below commands:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   cd \"C:\\workspace\\bitcoin\\bin\\\"\r\n   .\\bitcoind.exe -regtest=1 -port=18333 -rpcport=18222 -datadir=\"D:\\Node1\\\" -conf=\"D:\\Node1\\bitcoin.conf\"\r\n   ```\r\n   ```   \r\n   cd \"C:\\workspace\\bitcoin\\bin\\\"\r\n   .\\bitcoind.exe -regtest=1 -port=18777 -rpcport=18666 -datadir=\"E:\\Node2\\\" -conf=\"E:\\Node2\\bitcoin.conf\"\r\n   ```\r\n4. Open a third PowerShell session and you can use `bitcoin-cli` to run any RPC for Node 1 & Node 2:\r\n\r\n   \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/129726013-cde81e50-3629-4b0c-a372-dd5d5d363f5d.png)\r\n",
