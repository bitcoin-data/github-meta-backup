    "title": "Mempool trimming regression: Rejects my own high prority 0-fee transactions",
    "body": "Bitcoin was started like this a few days ago, after compiling latest version from git (4ee149a):\nbitcoind -daemon -txconfirmtarget=3 -sendfreetransactions -spendzeroconfchange=0 \n\nAfter running a few days, mempool trimming has begun:\n$ bitcoin-cli getmempoolinfo\n{\n  \"size\": 12167,\n  \"bytes\": 137785057,\n  \"usage\": 297081872,\n  \"maxmempool\": 300000000,\n  \"mempoolminfee\": 0.00001034\n}\n\nAnd now it rejects my own transactions.  I have a lot of old unspent coins in my wallet, which often result in high enough priority for a free transaction:\n\n$ bitcoin-cli sendfrom \"\" 1[redacted] 1.05\nerror code: -4\nerror message:\nError: The transaction was rejected! This might happen if some of the coins in your wallet were already spent, such as if you used a copy of wallet.dat and coins were spent in the copy but not marked as spent here.\n\nIt was clearly rejected:\n$ bitcoin-cli listtransactions \"\" 1\n[\n  {\n    \"account\": \"\",\n    \"address\": \"1[redacted]\",\n    \"category\": \"send\",\n    \"amount\": -1.05000000,\n    \"vout\": 0,\n    \"fee\": 0.00000000,\n    \"confirmations\": -1,\n    \"txid\": \"...\",\n    \"walletconflicts\": [\n    ],\n    \"time\": 1447066461,\n    \"timereceived\": 1447066461\n  }\n]\n\nBut this can not be trusted!  After a restart of bitcoind, the transaction shows up again, now with 0 confirmations.  This can lead to double transmissions if the user think the first attempt actually failed:\n[\n  {\n    \"account\": \"\",\n    \"address\": \"1[redacted]\",\n    \"category\": \"send\",\n    \"amount\": -1.05000000,\n    \"vout\": 0,\n    \"fee\": 0.00000000,\n    \"confirmations\": 0,\n    \"txid\": \"...\",\n    \"walletconflicts\": [\n    ],\n    \"time\": 1447066461,\n    \"timereceived\": 1447066461\n  }\n]\n\nPrivate details about the transaction available on request.\n\nSuggestion:\n0. Revert the current mempool trimming.  It is dangerous.\n1. Take priority into account when trimming.  Keep transactions with sufficient priority to get mined before the transactions which are removed due to low fee, using estimatefee and estimatepriority as guidance.  This will help prioritize non-spammy transactions as well.\n2. Give own transactions infinite priority.  If you are mining, this will make sure your own transactions will always be included if you leave room for free transactions.\n",

I have sent a transaction which got refused with -1 confirmations (assumed not sent), and then resurrected when I restarted bitcoind.\n\nSince the current trimming code favors relaying of paid spam instead of lower paying high priority transactions (much less likely to be spam), I think only taking the fee into account when trimming is an entirely wrong approach.  Keep the transactions which are most likely to get mined instead.  Transactions which will be mined in the next block using the default settings should not be evicted.\n",

      "body": "I think there is some general agreement that priority is not a metric we should be optimizing for - it significantly complicates a ton of code and sets a bad expectation from a user's point of view. In the medium term, miners will start using fees as a serious source of income and priority areas will go away (this is already happening for a few miners). We don't want users who are still using free transactions (while most have started paying fees) to be surprised when they suddenly have to pay fees again.\n\nWorse, priority areas only help power users and users who rarely use the system. It is unclear to me why we should be prioritizing these users over all others. Though these users are, indeed, less spammy, the only incentive-compatible way to reduce spam in the Bitcoin system as it exists today is to allow fees to rise to a point where spammers are no longer willing to pay it.\n\nOn November 11, 2015 12:23:38 AM PST, sturles notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @TheBlueMatt That would be very unfortunate.

      "body": "@TheBlueMatt What is your definition of \"medium term\"?  I have failed to find a difference in income per block for pools with a high -blockprioritysize (e.g. BitMinter which use 500k) and some Chineese pools which will include anything based on fee alone.  There are a few high paying transactions, and a very long tail which is practically worthless.  Since most high priority transactions pay a fee as well, just smaller fees than the spam, the difference in total block income is just a few satoshi.  There is no doubt which blocks include the most spam and blocks the most normal transactions, however.\n\nI think this complexity is something we have to live with, if we want it to be hard for a malicious user with a few bitcoins to not only block normal bitcoin transactions for a long time, but even remove them from the memory pools forever, by sending spam.  And also if we want to introduce incentives to reduce the utxo set, I can't see how that will be possible without setting a priority.  \n\nIn the past when someone started to DoS Bitcoin by sending a lot of spam with high fees, previous transactions using lower fees (estimated before the attack started) would still trickle through due to high priority.  This won't happen any more if you remove the priority system.  Instead the transactions will be erased from all memory pools.  This isn't what people have learned to expect.  When you send a transaction using the recommended fee, you expect it to get confirmed eventually, if not in the first block.  Bitcoin is not always fast, but it used to be reliable.\n\nI don't understand how the priority system only help power users and people who rarely use the system.  Which category would e.g. someone who only use bitcoin to pay for a beer and a burger every Friday go in?  Will the bar still accept bitcoins when transactions from trusted customers stop confirming eventually, like they used to?  I think this change is very bad for usability and adoption.\n",

      "body": "@TheBlueMatt, my take on this is that the long term status of priority is tenuous at best because I agree unless there is a change in consensus rules its hard to consider attributes that miners aren't incentivized to prioritize.   However in the meantime, as long as we're seeing significant hash power still reserve a priority space, it is useful to preserve the ability to send free high priority transactions.  This has to be balanced with the complexity of achieving this goal.  It was (rightfully) judged more important to safely limit the growth of the mempool than preserve this ability.  However if we can, without undue additional complexity, add back in the ability to have priority earn you space in the mempool and still be comfortable in the security properties of the limiting code then we should do so.\n",
