    "body": "I have the release candidate 1 running and noticed today that it is still at height 336370.  The block 336371 is not in the database, but I think it is still putting new blocks beyond that into the database.\n\nI have the bitcoind still running if someone has suggestions how to debug this, further.  I don't depend on it and haven't tried yet if restarting solves the problem.\n\nI have the relay node client from Matt Corallo running, which feeds the local bitcoind with blocks and transactions from the relay network.\n\n_Update_: I noticed that the block 336370 that was accepted is the orphaned block 000000000000000000929bbefb29a690c8913b3c066946d998bfd7c5426fb5e7.\n",

      "body": "I've been trying to track this down and I think I have a guess as to what could have occurred. \n\nWhich version of the relay client are you using?  Am I right in assuming you've whitelisted it?\n\nI believe at least the java and python versions of the relay client will send an inv for blocks they deliver followed by the block itself as part of their delivery, and because the relay client is probably whitelisted, that the relay node will be a preferred download peer and could be assigned a block to download.  If that were to happen, then the node would get stuck because the getdata would go unanswered, but because the block is \"in flight\" no other node would be asked to provide it.\n\nMore specifically, my guess is that the following likely occurred:\na) The network forks at block 370 (as shown above).\n\nb) Block 371 is inv'ed and delivered by the relay node.\nThis block would be discarded since its parent is unknown.  The getheaders message sent to the relay node is discarded by the relay code.\n\nc) Block 372 is inv'ed by one of the other peers.\nThe getheaders request sent in response was presumably answered and mapBlockIndex now contains the alternate block 370 along with blocks 371 and 372.\n\nSince you indicated most of your other peers are inbound connections, I think it's likely that the peer who inv'ed you 372 is not a preferred download peer (see main.cpp:295).  I believe that the inv handling code would request block 372 itself from the peer that inv'ed it, but to download block 371, my understanding is that the code defers assignment until later, in SendMessages.\n\nWhen SendMessages is called for each node, I believe the only preferred download peer that would have the block as available is the relay node peer.  The relay would be a preferred download peer if it's whitelisted (even though it's inbound), and in ProcessBlockAvailability (main.cpp:348) the hash for block 371, which was unknown when received, should then be able to be found in the block index and could be assigned.\n\nAssuming no other peers have inv'ed blocks 371 or 372 at the point , the node would have sent a getdata to the relay peer.  Unfortunately the relay peer ignores those messages, and I believe this would trigger a bug highlighted in #5463, namely that having a getdata ignored by a client causes the node to get stuck with the tip not advancing.  \n\nIf this analysis is right, it's not clear to me what the right solution to this is; presumably #5463 would solve this problem from lingering, but perhaps a solution that gets the tip moving more quickly again would be preferable, so that miners using the relay client don't find themselves mining on an old tip?\n",
