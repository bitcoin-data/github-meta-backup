      "body": "The signing certificate shows it was revoked on ‎Tuesday, ‎March ‎24, ‎**2020**. This seems back-dated. Normally, this happens when a publisher discovers a key compromise and wants to invalidate all binaries signed after the key was considered as compromised. Is it the case here?\r\n\r\nI noticed the unsigned version was pushed on March 25, 2021, on the occasion of the signing certificate's expiration. That shouldn't be needed, as the installer was timestamped, therefore will remain valid despite the cert having expired. So, I don't see the connection between the expiration of the cert and its revocation effective a year earlier. Can someone clarify what's going on?",

I think it was revoked because I asked for a renewal while the certificate was still valid, but I'm not sure. All I know is that on March 16th, when I purchased a renewal for the certificate, the current one was immediately revoked with a backdated revocation. The key was not compromised and the revocation was not requested. The revocation reason is not known.\r\n\r\nDue to changes to the code signing certificate OV requirements, we have been unable to get a new code signing certificate in order to remedy this issue. That is currently being worked on, and we should be able to get a certificate soon. Once the new certificate is issued, all of the affected versions will be re-signed and re-released.",
