There are a couple of complications.  \r\n- If the transaction has multiple low fee parents the resultant increase in total fee paid could be substantial.\r\n- Now imagine that you place a second transaction which spends other outputs from those same parents.  You will end up \"paying for the parent\" again, which is likely not necessary any more. \r\n\r\nI think in the GUI it should be possible to design a smarter system that warns you that the ancestor fee rate of the transaction you are about to place is lower than what is indicated by fee estimation.  And even give you an option to bump it higher to pay for parents (while showing you how much extra fee this is and warning you that you might be paying for the parents multiple times).   But without this extra level of user interaction, it's not clear to me how you would do this from the RPC API.\r\n",

When considering the fee rate of a transaction, you can compute it with awareness of other transactions that spend from it.  Actually I already have code that is already doing this in production by querying bitcoin with `getmempoolentry` and looking at all its ancestors and children.\r\n\r\nLooking at my logic it takes me O(n^2) time to compute the fee rate of a transaction, where n = how many unconfirmed transactions are in the graph. I'm not that that would ever be a problem, but I'm sure someone smarter than me could make it linear time too",
