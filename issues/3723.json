    "title": "mempool superblock redesign",
    "body": "One of the proposals floated about, originally from Gavin or @sipa IIRC, was modelling the mempool after a \"superblock.\"  This idea seems to elegantly solve a few problems.\n\nModel the memory pool as one big block, whose size is constrained to X 1MB blocks.  This super-block is sorted according to default bitcoind block-building rules: fee per kB, with a little area for under-fee (zero fee) high priority transactions.  Any newly arriving transaction is either (a) added to the memory pool, possibly triggering removal of other transactions, or (b) dropped and not relayed.\n\nThis would seem to deal with spam dynamically, as transactions would drop off the low end of the superblock.  This also effectively caps the size of the memory pool, reducing DoS attack surface.  And, it plays into transaction lifetime work (#3722).\n",

I personally have been lurking on the Bitcoin github repository, just hoping for this proposal to find acceptance.\n\nNot only would this proposal fix a lot of DoS & scalability issues. You could also decide to replace an old transaction in the superblock if a new transaction has the same inputs, but higher priority. At first glance, this will mitigate the problem of transactions getting stuck in the mempool.\n\nHowever, it would also be a really good way to have dynamic fees, as planned, work even better.\n",

Even currently there are differences between nodes due to the version. \n\nIt means that clients have to adapt and cope with non-relaying and non-confirming transactions better.\n",
