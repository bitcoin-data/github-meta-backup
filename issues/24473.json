    "body": "Take a local look at the source code in this folder:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/secp256k1/src\r\n\r\nNotice the 1 and 2 megabyte source files.\r\n\r\nThis leads to analysis problems. Long wait times.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion/request is that this source code is changed such that these big look-up tables are read from disk instead of dumped into c and h files.\r\n\r\nThis would reduce the source files considerably and would solve analysis problems. Right now only way to solve analysis problems is to delete this particular folder.",
