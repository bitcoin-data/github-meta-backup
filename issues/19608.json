    "title": "Expose PSBT AddInput/AddOutput via RPC",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nAlice creates a PSBT via the RPC API, and signs all inputs with `SIGHASH_SINGLE | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY`.  She then sends the signed PSBT to Bob, who wants to add some more inputs and outputs via the RPC API without losing Alice's signatures, so that he can broadcast the resulting transaction without asking Alice to re-sign.  Unfortunately, the PSBT RPC API doesn't seem to provide any way of appending new inputs/outputs to an existing PSBT; it only allows creating a new PSBT (via `createpsbt`) with the full set of inputs/outputs, which has the side effect of losing the existing signatures.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIt would be useful for the PSBT RPC API to expose the `AddInput` and `AddOutput` methods of `PartiallySignedTransaction`.  These would allow adding new inputs/outputs without affecting whatever signature data might already be present in the existing inputs.  Something like this:\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-cli addoutputpsbt 'existingpsbt' '{\"data\":\"00010203\"}'`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI considered adapting `combinepsbt` to copy signatures between two transactions with different TXID's if the signatures are valid in both transactions given the `SIGHASH` flags, but this seems rather unwieldy.\r\n\r\nIt might be desirable to support adding multiple outputs (or inputs) in one RPC call, by making the 2nd argument an array of objects instead of an object.  Or this might just complicate things unnecessarily.  I don't feel particularly strongly about this.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nN/A.\r\n",

The intermediate transactions in my use case aren't actually valid, because they contain imbalanced inputs/outputs (e.g. the outputs might sum to more than the inputs), so they can't just be broadcasted to the network.  But, if I understand you correctly, you're saying that in terms of serialization/deserialization, they look exactly like valid transactions, thus we can treat them as complete, valid transactions for the purpose of transferring them between the users, and there's no need to use the PSBT serialization?",
