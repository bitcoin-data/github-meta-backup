    "body": "Dear Sir or Madam!\r\n\r\nMy name is Yaroslav.\r\nI have a problem with my bitcoin purse.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the distant 2013 I tried to deal with mining. At that time it was much easier than it is now.\r\nI downloaded the official program (the version I did not remember), installed it on my computer with a powerful, at that time, videocard and mined.\r\nWhen I decided to stop I had a bit less than 1 btc. Without having any possibility to cash it out I just saved it to my wallet.dat. I did it with the thought in mind that in some time I would restore mining on its base.\r\nCurrently, it is already 2 months that I can not restore my wallet. I installed different versions of the software from bitcoin.org, synchronized them, but the balance writes 0.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you help me find out the reason of the fact that in 2013 I had some money there (the rate was $ 130) but 0 at the moment?\r\n\r\nP.S. The only person who had access to the wallet was me. I even have the exact date I used it for the last time.",
