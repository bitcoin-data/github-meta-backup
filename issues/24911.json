    "title": "[POC] [RFC] build: Separate GUI application build system",
    "body": "There is an inherent contradiction between (a) Bitcoin Core build system and (b) Bitcoin Core GUI build system.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core:\r\n- strives to minimize dependencies for security reasons\r\n- adds new features without introducing new build dependencies (as usual)\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core GUI:\r\n- new features (e.g., QR-code reader, QML-based UI, OpenGL support, Wayland support) usually do introduce new build dependencies\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA concept of the separated GUI build system is here: https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin-qtw/commits/220418-add-core-subtree\r\n\r\nOne could test it as follows:\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./autogen.sh\r\n$ ./configure --disable-fuzz-binary --disable-tests --disable-bench --without-utils --without-daemon --without-libs\r\n$ make\r\n$ ./src/qt/bitcoin-qt\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe suggested approach uses this repository as a _subtree_.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- ability to drop GUI-related stuff from this repo\r\n- ability to use alternative build system for the current Qt Widget based GUI (e.g., use CMake which allows to adopt Qt6 more seamless, even without upstream support of `*.pc` files)\r\n- ability to develop alternative UI frameworks (e.g., Qt Quick based GUI; fwiw, keeping [QML GUI project](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml) synchronized to this repo preserving commit history goes out of hands due to the shared build system)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- a GUI repo becomes a completely separated one, not like current https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\n- the release process requires to be modified to handle GUI binaries from a separated repo",

We could change the build system of the GUI even in the same repository; if that were what we really wanted, I think that'd even be easier than doing it in separate repositories.\r\n\r\nRegarding the separation of repositories, I believe that is only a good idea if there is a well-defined stable interface between the codebases. Otherwise, you run into difficulties whenever changes to the boundary between the two need to be made, like lockstep commits and the synchronization overhead between the two projects - exactly what separating them likely was intended to avoid. I don't know to what extent that is the case with the GUI at this point.",

(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24911#issuecomment-1104053117).\r\n\r\nConcept ~0 for me, since I don't work very heavily with the build system, and I think people who do work more on build issues are in a better position to decide what their preferences are.\r\n\r\nI do now understand why this issue is proposing separating the build system and repositories both at the same time. With the changes you described to the build system which make make bitcoin-qt build depend on the bitcoind build, it would make no sense to keep dead bitcoin-qt stuff inside the bitcoind repository.",

After all we still need to have the code in this repo to run the guix build and produce the gui binaries, so it seems easiest to put whatever needs to be done inside this repo.\r\n\r\nI think the design goals of Bitcoin Core should also (on a best effort basis) be applied to the GUI. So if you want to introduce a new GUI feature and it seems useful, it should be added here. If it doesn't seem useful, it probably shouldn't be added, neither here or in a separate repo or separate build system.\r\n",

      "body": "> The main problem -- What is a widely accepted by developers in this repo way to introduce new GUI-specific features which usually require new build dependencies?\r\n> There is an inherent contradiction between (a) Bitcoin Core build system and (b) Bitcoin Core GUI build system.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is a widely accepted way, because adding new features to the GUI is a rarity, and, as you've outlined in the op, what you want to do is at odds with our thesis of minimizing dependencies/third party code, and ultimately, the number of (unrelated to bitcoin) concerns we have to deal with in this repository.\r\n\r\nAs I outlined in this comment, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22708#issuecomment-1100861599, without any coherent GUI plan, I'm not sure what to do. However I'm pretty certain the answer isn't to keep adding new dependencies and support for more features (to the GUI).\r\n\r\nI agree with Marcos comments here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24911#issuecomment-1104091542, shifting things to a new repo doesn't really solve anything as long as this project is still building and releasing these binaries to end users.",
