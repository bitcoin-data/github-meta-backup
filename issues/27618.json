BTC network is absolutely organic and all economic rules are totally balanced - fee/rate/complexity.\r\n\r\nAll application-level business logic such as tokens and custom data, should be moved to shard/side-chains to keep the main network simple and light as possible. Great example - Lightning network, or the design of Polka/TON networks.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is not a data lake storage. Moreover, it becomes harder and harder to launch any p2p node with huge (useless in most cases) data inside blockchain, it's a path to nowhere.\r\n\r\nDo you think it's possible to avoid (by design) all custom transactions except the transfer of bitcoins to avoid network stuck?\r\n\r\nThank you.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nThe main problem is scalability, we're working on new Bitcoin addresses and signature types to keep the network as light as possible, but it doesn't make any sense if we put useless information in Bitcoin transactions except BTC transfers.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe possible solution is to hard code transactions analyzer before acceptance in mempool or making a separate network which doesn't affect the main network in terms of load.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
