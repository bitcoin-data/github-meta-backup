But you will have some trouble doing this. Here is the logic for `IsInitialBlockDownload`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L1716\n\nThis tricking would involve either:\n- Current tip is 24*6 blocks behind the best header chain\n- Current tip is older than 24 hours behind current time (configurable with `-maxtipage`)\n\nIn addition to this, all nodes would have to restart: after the IsInitialBlockDownload call returns `false` it latches to `false` for the rest of the run, so a running node will never revert to IBD status.\n\nI (and I think most others too) have lways been slightly uncomfortable with having many things depending on this heuristic, but these measures exist to prevent bandwidth waste (fetching transactions during IBD) as well as IIRC to prevent some fingerprinting attacks.\n",
