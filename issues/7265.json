This makes it slightly more bothersome to change the name of the project, because changing the AC_INIT line in configure.ac isn't sufficient.\n\nI don't know if this is something you want to fix in your repo, since it mostly only affects downstream projects like Namecoin.  If you are interested in fixing this, I'd be happy to submit a PR.\n",

      "body": "Hello,\n\nI notice that I was a little bit vague; apologies for this.\n\nFirst off, thanks @luke-jr for pointing out #7192 ; that's definitely helpful.\n\nThe specific issue I'm having is as follows:\n\nNamecoin's build scripts generate Windows executable files such as \"namecoind.exe\" and \"namecoin-qt.exe\" rather than \"bitcoind.exe\" and \"bitcoin-qt.exe\".  (I don't think this is specific to altcoins, since non-altcoin forks of Bitcoin Core may very well change these as well.)  I'm not 100% sure where in the Namecoin build scripts \"bitcoin\" is changed to \"namecoin\" in the output filenames, but it seems to me that PACKAGE_TARNAME as defined in configure.ac's AC_INIT line is the logical place to do this.  (If anyone disagrees, by all means correct me and tell me why I'm wrong.)  In any event, Namecoin is successfully generating namecoind.exe and namecoin-qt.exe, but setup.nsi.in (which Namecoin hasn't modified from Bitcoin's codebase yet) has the filenames \"bitcoind.exe\" and \"bitcoin-qt.exe\" hardcoded, which causes the NSIS installer build step to fail.  It seems to me that replacing \"bitcoin\" in those filename strings with a reference to PACKAGE_TARNAME would fix this.  (Indeed, I tested such a change and it got Namecoin to build a working installer.)  Certainly the Namecoin devs could just do a search/replace of \"bitcoin\" to \"namecoin\" in that file; that just seems kind of kludgy given that PACKAGE_TARNAME is available.\n\nI'm definitely not asking about completely rebranding the UI to change \"bitcoins\" to some other currency unit.  (While that would presumably be helpful for translations, i.e. not just altcoins, it's not the focus of this inquiry.)\n\nCheers.\n",
