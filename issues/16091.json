No keys in the internal keypool and can't generate any keys.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I try to Google this error, I only come up with mirrors of Bitcoin's source code. debug.log doesn't show any additional information.\r\n\r\nNo money is sent and there are no new transactions with the wallet.\r\n\r\nThe wallet is encrypted and unlocked. Using bitcoin-qt v0.18.0 on Gentoo Linux. Tried both the third-party layman version and compiling the official bitcoincore.org source and both fail to let me make a purchase. The last transaction on the wallet was in December 2018 and whatever the latest version of bitcoin-qt was back then.",

Since then there have been 3 releases & still the problem persists. I know you guys are busy, but that's pretty lame. How is a casual user supposed to know about this & how to fix it? Suddenly being unable to send payments from one's wallet for no apparent reason is enough to scare anyone, especially as there is no mention of this in the release notes of any of those 3 releases.\r\n\r\nSomething in the release notes along the lines of \"You might suddenly be unable to send coins from your own wallet for no reason if you upgrade to any version above 17.1 - this is a long known about issue\" would be appropriate - at least users would then be aware & decide if they want to be locked out of their own wallets - only to get asked for a \"review\" here when asking for help.",

I'm not sure if I should temporarily use 0.17.1, or build the master branch to upgrade the wallet. I don't feel particularly comfortable using pre-release code for mainnet wallets.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I did decide to build from master for the purpose of upgrading the wallet only. This went fine though I did have to deplete the keypool by running `getnewaddress` some 800 times (I did this using a bash for loop) before bech32 addresses would be generated.\r\n\r\nHopefully in the future more attention will be made towards any wallet upgrades so that they go more smoothly as non-technically minded users wouldn't be able to resolve this as easily.",

If upgrading take note of my previous comment:\r\n\r\n> I did have to deplete the keypool by running getnewaddress some 800 times (I did this using a bash for loop) before bech32 addresses would be generated.\r\n\r\nHopefully 0.21 will be released soon, so it might be best to simply wait unless access is urgent.",
