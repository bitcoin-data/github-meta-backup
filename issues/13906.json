    "title": "Effective value coin selection may not work properly with watching only utxos",
    "body": "Looking through how fees are calculated for calculating the effective value for BnB coin selection, I think there may be an issue with utxos that are considered ISMINE_WATCH_ONLY. Since we cannot solve or sign for these UTXOs, we are unable to calculate the size of the input for these utxos and thus the fee. This means that when we perform BnB on these watching only utxos that the fee will be zero and the effective value will be the entire value. So we could end up with much lower fees than we intend if we are selecting watching only utxos.\r\n\r\nI haven't actually tested this yet, but it seems to be correct if I am following the logic correctly.",
