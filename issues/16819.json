If you've got a tx that has parents A, B, C; and that conflicts with tx's X (parent A) and Y (parent B), then beforehand you had:\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> ..., A, X, [children X]\r\n> ..., B, Y, [children Y]\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n> (maybe some tx's were descendants of both X and Y, but it's worse if there weren't any like that) and afterwards you have:\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> ..., A, tx\r\n> ..., B, tx\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n> You don't have C in the mempool because that would fail the \"replacement-adds-unconfirmed\" test later.\r\n\r\n> So you know tx's ancestor checks pass, because they're actually worked out; you know A,B's ancestor checks pass because they don't change, tx's descendant check is trivial, and you know A,B and all their parent's descendant checks passed, because they did so when X and Y were there -- as far as sizes go, if they were all at their limit, then the max size for tx is the minimum of the descendant sizes of each tx that was replaced.\r\n\r\n> So I think you could replace the `setConflicts.size() == 1` test with:\r\n\r\n>```\r\n> if (!setConflicts.empty()) {\r\n>    auto conflict = setIterConflicting.begin();\r\n>    assert(conflict != setIterConflicting.end());\r\n>    uint64_t bump = (*conflict)->GetSizeWithDescendants();\r\n>    while(++conflict != setIterConflicting.end()) {\r\n>        bump = std::min(bump, (*conflict)->GetSizeWithDescendants());\r\n>    }\r\n>    nLimitDescendants += 1;\r\n>    nLimitDescendantSize += bump;\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nFrom sipa\r\n> I haven't thought hard about the effect on potential DoS issues this policy change may have.",

However, it's a bit more complicated to describe the circumstances under which the replacement would succeed: using the minimum of size_with_descendants of each directly conflicting transaction should work for respecting chain limits, but it's conservative and I imagine it could be difficult for a wallet author to try to determine under what circumstances they should conflict with additional small transactions versus restricting to just replacing a single large transaction.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I think you could end up in a situation where, in order to conflict with and replace two transactions, you would have to first relay additional transactions to pump up the size_with_descendants of one of them(!).  Imagine two mempool transactions A and B, where A has a large size_with_descendants and has a parent near its descendant size limit, while B is small and has no in-mempool parents.  Then the minimum size_with_descendants of A and B is small, so any attempt to replace the two transactions with a new one would fail (because the bump size will be too low to pass the descendant size limits associated with A's parents) -- unless B's size_with_descendants were increased first.  This is obviously counterintuitive (and wasteful), so I think we should stick with simpler behavior that is easier to explain to wallet authors...",
