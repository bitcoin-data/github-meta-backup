    "title": "Unsuccessful Bitcoin download (I think)",
    "body": "First, I acknowledge being technologically illiterate, so I hope I'll be able to adequately explain my problem. Last evening, I tried to download Bitcoin into my computer, but I believe the download was unsuccessful. At least, I don't believe I am able to use the system, and I am eager to become a participant.\n\nThe current status of my attempt to join is that when I open my Wallet window, I get the following message: \"Urgent, chain fork, stop mining on Version .8\"\n\nI didn't even know I was 'mining.' I was just trying to download the program. Also, both the 'wallet' and 'recent transactions' values show this (in red letters): \"out of sync\"\n\nDuring the download process, I was watching the progress, as there was an ongoing tabulation of 'remaining blocks,' as the process reported it was \"synchronizing with the network.\" Unfortunately, this was taking several hours to complete, and when it got down to a little over 30,000 blocks remaining, I fell asleep, and my computer shut off. Everything had been seemingly going fine until then, but when I turned my computer back on, and tried to resume the download, that's when I got the messages I've referred to above. \n\nI thought, well, I guess I'll have to start the whole process over again, so I uninstalled the Bitcoin program altogether, but when I reinstalled it, it went right back to where it had left off, and repeated the \"Urgent, chain fork, stop mining\" warning. So, I closed out the Wallet window again, and that's where it sits now. \n\nI want to become a Bitcoin participant, but I don't know how I'll be able to overcome this problem to do so. Help with moving forward from here will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n",

Basically, the old, 0.7 client that was recently replaced had a\nbug, and it meant that the new 0.8 clients and the old 0.7 clients and\nminers were creating separate chains. This has to be sorted out, and the\nchosen method is for everyone to switch to the chain created by the 0.7\nclients and miners, as all of us can use that one.\nBut this means that, at the moment, transactions that only get included in\none chain could end up being orphaned, and there is a chance that someone\ncould use this confusion to execute a double spend attack.\n\nBasically, what this means is that you should hold off using bitcoin for\nwhile (few hours?), and everything should be fine.\n\nOn 12 March 2013 12:39, lawrence97431 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> First, I acknowledge being technologically illiterate, so I hope I'll be\n> able to adequately explain my problem.
