    "title": "wallet coin selection: be aware of timelocks and allow commands to set an optional block height when selecting coins",
    "body": "The wallet should not select a yet-unavailable coin to fund a transaction. We could use the latest block height by default and allow the user to set one when calling for instance `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, to effectively tell the wallet \"select me coins such as they'll be available after block height `N`).\r\n\r\nAlso maybe the wallet should set the right values for `nSequence`Â / `nLockTime` if it spends timelocked coins? Curious what people think.\r\n\r\ncc @ishaanam since we discussed it together.",
