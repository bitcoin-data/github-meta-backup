    "body": "For improving coverage in process_message fuzzing, Eclipser (https://github.com/SoftSec-KAIST/Eclipser/tree/v1.x) has proven extremely effective (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/70 https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/69 https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/68 https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/67).\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not supported by OSS-Fuzz, and currently running standalone with requires using a patch such as in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22472.\r\n\r\nI would like to add instructions on fuzzing with Eclipser to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md but it isn't really useful until some solution to the /tmp cleanup issues is available.\r\n\r\nLong term, there needs to be a procedure for running Eclipser at regular intervals, for long runs to cover code that OSS-Fuzz libFuzzer and afl are bad at.",

      "body": "> @MarcoFalke what's the process for these on the server? Just continuous libFuzzer, and occasionally checking for new stuff to merge?\r\n\r\nJup, libFuzzer for each target (with/without sanitizers). I manually `rsync` the inputs and add them to qa-assets if they are useful.\r\n\r\n> Any idea if more came from your libFuzzer runs or from OSS-Fuzz (or an equal mix)?\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say. OSS-Fuzz inputs are 30 days old (the public archives) https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/blob/2a7d883b08c8b132e61371c1bc9f336c71c56bc6/download_oss_fuzz_inputs.py#L9. The inputs on my server are fresh (up-to-date for the latest code). OSS-Fuzz added 8k files (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/commit/9c6d701938ee8b7be5e1b66895fcba4ac728b7dd). My run afterward added 27k files (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/commit/2a7d883b08c8b132e61371c1bc9f336c71c56bc6)\r\n\r\n> @MarcoFalke @practicalswift this is a tangent, but there's not a better place to discuss it (would either of you like to join an email thread for some \"dumb questions\" from me?)\r\n\r\nI like all my Bitcoin Core communication to be public for transparency and documentation purposes. And often someone's dumb questions are someone else's dumb questions, too. If you prefer a place with less watchers you can also ask over at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/issues. Though, I am also happy to start an email thread.\r\n\r\n> Is rpc stateful in that one call can have impact on the next, in the fuzzing setup? It looks like the fuzz harness only does one command. If rpc is not somewhere this would be useful, are there targets where performing a sequence would be useful? If so, are they doing so now?\r\n\r\nYes, some RPCs are stateful. However in practice this doesn't lead to issues, because the only state IIRC is blockchain, mempool and wallet state. For blockchain it will be hard for the fuzzer to find new state (valid blocks) on it's own. Same goes for mempool. The wallet is currently not compiled into the fuzz binary, so shouldn't cause issues either.\r\n\r\nIf in the future any state turns out to make issues non-reproducible, we should look into fixing that. And conversely if we believe there are issues to be found only with state preserved between calls, we should look into extending the fuzz target to cover that.\r\n\r\nI've written a bunch of targets to be keep state around for a longer time. For example there is `process_messages` (trailing `s`) that allows for multiple messages to be sent, because net processing is stateful.",
