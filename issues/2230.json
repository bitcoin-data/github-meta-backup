    "body": "Some changes/improvements to code that is new for 0.8 are still possible before doing RCs. These include:\n- Dropping support for the pre-checksum undo file format (#2216)\n- Changing the directory naming scheme. From a discussion on IRC it was apparent that for example the name coins/ was confusing (people thought it was related to the wallet). One suggestion:\n  - blocks/undo files remain in blocks/*\n  - blktree/ becomes blocks/index/\\* (so it is intuitively clear it's associated with the blocks directory)\n  - coins/ becomes chaindata/\n  - optionally: put everything inside a subdirectory blockchain/, and perhaps make it configurable with -blockchaindir=, as it is now independent from the wallet anyway.\n- Adding an automatically generated README in the data directory/directories to explain what the different files/directories contain (suggested by andytoshi on IRC).\n- Calling an ftruncate() (or windows equivalent) on the block files when abandoning them would remove the permanent storage waste caused by pre-allocated padding being left over.\n",
