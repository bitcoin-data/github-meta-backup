So would be good to request an update over https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/83.\r\n\r\nBut, it seems that the problematic presented here is not that one. Based on the information provided @GregTonoski:\r\n\r\n> getwalletinfo\r\n{\r\n\"walletname\": \"test-watch_only\",\r\n\"walletversion\": 169900,\r\n\"format\": \"sqlite\",\r\n\"balance\": 0.00000000,\r\n\"unconfirmed_balance\": 0.00000000,\r\n\"immature_balance\": 0.00000000,\r\n\"txcount\": 0,\r\n\"keypoolsize\": 0,\r\n\"keypoolsize_hd_internal\": 0,\r\n\"paytxfee\": 0.00000000,\r\n\"private_keys_enabled\": false,\r\n\"avoid_reuse\": false,\r\n\"scanning\": false,\r\n\"descriptors\": true,\r\n\"external_signer\": false\r\n}\r\n\r\nThere is no balance in the wallet. So, probably the `importdescriptors` RPC command call was done with `timestamp=now` and no rescan was performed.\r\nWhich, if that is the case, then this is not a GUI issue (or not entirely.. we could have a simple descriptors import functionality in the GUI that enables rescan by default, letting users disable it in an \"advanced\" tab).",
