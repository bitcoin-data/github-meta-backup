    "body": "`importmulti` doesn't import all known permutations of the address into `setWatchOnly` but the `-cli` and `-qt` allow the user to request the `bech32` variant. `IsMine` logic only goes the other direction: `p2sh -> p2wpkh`.\r\n\r\nIf funds are sent to the bech32 address the wallet doesn't pick up any of it.\r\n\r\nTwo ideas to fix:\r\n1) Don't and deploy descriptor wallets and `importdescriptor` instead since this is just for extreme power users and everything legacy `IsMine` is horrible.\r\n2) Have `importmulti` descriptor import the bech32 version of the address as well into `setWatchOnly`\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nMaybe the `p2sh -> p2wpkh` direction working is the bug and that should be disabled?",

      "body": "There are lots of problems with the current way of working, where often importing a key or a script results in certain related addresses/scripts to become IsMine as well. This includes the fact that it's harder/expensive to construct a list of all scriptPubKeys/addresses that belong to a wallet, and unclarity about the exact semantics.\r\n\r\nDescriptors were designed exactly to solve this problem, so we can have concise descriptions about _exactly_ what is in a wallet, rather than having it implicitly defined based on a set of known private keys, public keys, scripts, and watch-only scripts. `importmulti` with descriptors only approximates this, as it's using the old IsMine logic, which means that inevitably it's going to treat some things as IsMine that weren't requested. I don't think there is anything we can do about that, except perhaps adding a clarification that importing a descriptor may automatically also import a few more things (though only things with the same semantics; e.g. importing a multisig address should never make payments to the individual pubkeys be treated as yours).\r\n\r\nWith descriptor wallets, it'll finally be possible to be exact, and importing a particular descriptor will only ever treat that precise descriptor's addresses as IsMine.",
