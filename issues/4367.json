      "body": "P2Pool is a decentralized Bitcoin mining pool that works by creating a peer-to-peer network of miner nodes. \n\nDecentralized payout pooling solves the problem of centralized mining pools degrading the decentralization of Bitcoin and avoids the risk of hard to detect theft by pool operators.\nMiners are configured to connect to a P2Pool node that can be run locally, alongside the miner. P2Pool users must run a full Bitcoin node which serves the purpose of independently validating transactions and the Bitcoin blockchain. P2Pool also supports merged mining and several alternative blockchains.\nP2Pool nodes work on a chain of shares similar to Bitcoin's blockchain. Each node works on a block that includes payouts to the previous shares' owners and the node itself, which can also result in a share if it meets P2Pool's difficulty.\nBecause of the importance of strengthening Bitcoin's decentralization, some Bitcoin supporters donate to P2Pool miners, resulting in average returns above 100% of the expected reward. \n",
