    "title": "BIP113 breaks mining protocol",
    "body": "Currently all mining knows that there is a 7200s limit on using roll-n-time\nThis refers to moving the ntime forward when mining, to generate more unique work.\n\nOf course this isn't an issue within master cgminer, since it limits ntime rolling to quite a small value, however there is no currently implemented command in the stratum protocol to specify limits on roll-n-time, since it has always been a constant 7200 seconds.\nMiners also are currently not required to know the current time for all pooled mining, including p2pool, since there is currently nothing in the mining protocol that would affecte a miner with the incorrect current time.\n\nThere is also no information provided in the getblocktemplate command specifying what the 'current' limit is.\nThis would of course be MANDATORY at the least, to implement a break in protocol - that requires all miners to create and implement a new protocol defining ntime roll limits different to the current value.\n\nI am of course referring to, at the least, more than 90% of all bitcoin mining.\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki\n\nThis BIP incorrectly seems to think that mining uses ntime to gather more fees.\nIt doesn't. That may be a side effect in the future due to changes in the bitcoin protocol that don't take mining into consideration, but is NOT AT ALL the reason why ntime is currently adjusted.\nMining uses ntime to generate more work due to the limitation inflicted upon mining of the nonce only being 32 bits.\n\nThis is a complete deal breaker for implementation of anything else that includes this BIP since any mining pool may lose blocks to miners that can generate large ntime values, and there is no way for a pool to currently verify the ntime rolling limit of all miners, or to specify a limit, that miners will guarantee to adhere to, based on the new random value that is dependent upon previous random block times.\n",
