    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI posted earlier that I'm working on an Electron-based UI for `bitcoind`. I would like to embed an executable version of `bitcoind` within my app but I couldn't figure out how to do that for macOS.\r\n\r\n(I haven't tried to do it for Linux or Windows, but I assume it's easier to do because `bitcoind` is part of the release on those platforms. I just need to copy it to my app's directory and execute it from there and it should work.)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nRelease an executable version of `bitcoind` for macOS.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI tried to build `bitcoind` on my macOS machine then execute it on another macOS machine, but it complained about missing dependencies (`boost` I think). I don't know `make` or `autoconf` so that was a dead-end for me.\r\n\r\nNow I'm asking potential users of my app to have Bitcoin Core UI running with `server=1` in `bitcoin.conf`. Otherwise my app won't work. It would be so much better if I could make this a seamless process by embedding `bitcoind` within my app.\r\n\r\nRelated StackExchange issues:\r\n\r\n* https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/43148/bitcoin-cli-not-found-on-osx\r\n* https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/5733/accesing-bitcoind-through-terminal-on-mac",
