    "title": "OSX Maverick \"App Nap\" slowdown",
    "body": "Reported via email:\n\nThe only issue I've come across period, isn't really a problem. But it is confusing to someone downloading Bitcoin-Qt unaware of OS X Maverick's under the surface options. When I first opened it up and set if off downloading the blockchain I thought there was a problem as it was doing it incredibly slow. Much slower than usual. And when I clicked on the battery icon at the top of the screen, there's a new feature in Mavericks which lets you know of \"Apps Using Significant Energy\". When Chrome was the only app that appeared I realized something was wrong.\n\nI had a bit of knowledge about a new feature in Mavericks called App Nap and I had a hunch it was something to do with that. It was. App Nap is a new feature designed for optimizing battery life that puts background/non-visible apps with no audio, video or otherwise relevant to current usage, to sleep. So whenever I was browsing in Chrome, Qt was fully napping. I have since read that there's a full App Nap API for developers to take advantage of to tweak which parts or aspects of an app can or can't be put to sleep, or turn off napping of the app full stop; so devs have control over this feature, but it is enabled by default.\n\nUntil then, I figured out a simple way to turn off app napping on the user's side with any app as well. You can right click any app, click Get Info, and at the top there's a new checkbox named Prevent App Nap. I imagine this is useful to anyone, or yourself, using Qt on Mavericks as doing anything without it seems to completely stop Qt from synchronising with the blockchain.\n",

I'm pretty patient, but bitcoin-qt blocks a lot of ram while living.\n\nBut even with AppNap disabled it's now slow again, after starting with some speed, and its neither the cpu (<5%) nor adsl/internet (<1%). hm.. i'll see tomorrow...\n",
