    "title": "The ChainstateManager never uses the snapshot chainstate in anything unrelated to tests; should we just take it out?",
    "body": "While working around on #24760, trying to move things around and centralize BlockIndex loading from DB for testing, I stumbled upon `m_snapshot_chainstate`, which seems to never be used at any stage in the code at all. I would like to advocate for removing it (which I'm happy to give a shot) because it just complicates things. I guess it's a relic from something in the past (?).\r\n\r\nOr... maybe I'm missing what it's used for?\r\n\r\nFrom my analysis, here's how `m_snapshot_chainstate` can get assigned (excluding tests):\r\n\r\n- With `ChainstateManager::InitializeChainstate()`, but that's only called in `LoadChainstate()` (which is called in `init.cpp`), which keeps the second parameter `std::nullopt`, the default, which means it never gets assigned.\r\n- With `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`, which is never called anywhere\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing something... I'm not sure. But if it's not used anywhere, I would like to advocate for removing it to make ChainState management monolithic and simple. \r\n\r\nAnd just between us :-) , while I was working with #24760, I saw that with the pointers that switch between states and I was frustrated that I left the whole thing for a week, until I came back now and I'm happy to see that only one ChainState is being used. Simple is better. \r\n\r\nLet me know whether you guys support such a move. I think this is doable in one day I can put a PR for it today or tomorrow.",
