It is used as MSG_THINBLOCK for xthin blocks.\n\nThe existing type MSG_THINBLOCK is already in use and widely deployed:\nIn [Bitcoin XT](https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/blob/master/src/protocol.h#L168), [Bitcoin Classic](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/blob/develop/src/protocol.h#L347) and [Bitcoin Unlimited](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/blob/0.12.1bu/src/protocol.h#L378).\n\nPlease consider changing the enum value to an available one. I plan to add compact blocks to XT and I'd rather not have to guess the enum values meaning from context.\n",

      "body": "@achow101: xthin was included in a BU release in [March](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/bitcoin-unlimited-v0-12-x-relay-first-official-bu-release.992/) .  A second implementation (not a merge) was released by XT [a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/4p7pl3/bitcoin_xt_release_f_has_been_tagged/). FWIW, first prototype was in [Dec, 2015](https://github.com/ptschip/bitcoinxt/commit/7ea5854a3599851beffb1323544173f03d45373b#diff-1df47808b82268c616535e7b20216dfbR157).\n\nI agree the BUIP should mention this enum. Lessons learned I suppose. It's also IMHO a good idea to at least peek at the existing wheel when re-inventing a new one. Extending this enum is an obvious way to request a new block type and xthin is not exactly a hidden gem.\n\n@jameshilliard: Nodes supporting xthin need to respond correctly to MSG_THINBLOCK - even though MSG_XTHINBLOCK is mostly used.\n\nIf Core cannot change to an available enum value it’s probably possible to derive its meaning from context. If a node has sent “sendcmpct” it means MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK, if not then it means MSG_THINBLOCK. Both the BIP and the BUIP could be updated to reflect this.\n",

It is too late to change the enum now, this should have been indicated during the review phase for [BIP152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki) which mentions this:\n\n> A new inv type (MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK == 4) and several new protocol messages are added: sendcmpct, cmpctblock, getblocktxn, and blocktxn.\n\nAlso the number for `MSG_THINBLOCK` should have been mentioned in a BIP so that reviewers could have been aware of it.\nThe purpose of BIPs is to provide network-wide coordination exactly for cases such as this. If people don't follow the process there are bound to be collisions such as this.\n\n> My BIP was not even assigned a number so I did not bother to update it with the final implementation details. I'd be happy to do so now if it will receive a number\n\nNumbers are only assigned after a draft BIP is written. See [BIP1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki#bip-editor-responsibilities--workflow).\n\nClosing this issue as there is nothing to be done here. Please let it be a learning experience for next time. We don't have a lot of process in Bitcoin development, but the little bit that exists tends to exists for a good reason.\n",

It is irrelevant to blame anyone, arguments really go both ways. As I said, it is good that this was caught in the RC time.\n\nI think if you ignore this valuable feedback on your competing design, while there is a clear demonstration that your not-yet-released software can't interoperate with something that has been on the market for 6 months, you are creating a disruption to the Bitcoin ecosystem and on top of that you should be ashamed of yourselves.\n",

      "body": "I don't see anything wrong here. I think the issue was incorrectly opened.\n\nYes, they use the same enum.  So what? Support for BIP152 is negotiated. As far as I know the _only_ consequence of the index reuse is that an implementation couldn't support both protocols simultaneously on a single connection. That is it.  It would make no logical sense to run both since they both accomplish the same thing (though BIP152 does so more simply and efficiently).\n\nIf \"xthin\" actually had a written specification or had this concern otherwise been raised earlier I would have argued that both should use the same enum, as they both do the same thing and they both couldn't logically be used at the same time. So through xthin's lack of documentation we ended up with a result that was the same as what I would have argued for had the question been raised.\n\nThe issue is doubly moot when, presumably due to a lack of a specification, the existing \"xthin\" implementations are already incompatible with each other. (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/commit/833cd35dcaa79fa3e91f271458ce44c085ea60a2 ); and if something did have to change-- right now I observe five currently-BIP152-using peers for every XT+Classic+Unlimited peer (and only 'unlimited' even has released support for 'xthin'). \n",

      "body": "So, someone was asked to write a specification, and a draft was emailed around, and it excluded a specification detail which you are now arguing should have been known because somehow readers were supposed to know the value that was not included? ok\n\nI see at least two opportunities here that are overlooked. @gandrewstone emailed a draft around, which did not include the enum value, a regrettable situation, but at least he gave a good faith effort in that direction. Secondly, there was also public peer review and code review for the bip152 proposal, bip152 draft, and a public implementation of bip152 for code review as well, all of which were excellent opportunities for collaboration and analysis of any perceived potential problems.\n\nThankfully, it seems like this is not an actual issue, as discussed above, such as in terms of the network layer. However, this serves as an interesting example of how it's useful to communicate with other Bitcoin developers through BIPs and other communication.\n\nI am not presently convinced regarding the claims of \"asked to recall my products from a market\" and \"p2p layer breakage\" and \"showstopper\". It's the same user, and I note the absence of any such request from anyone else in the thread. Readers of this issue might be interested to note that a social media outlet has targeted this issue page, and that the thread could be experiencing the effects of brigading as a result.\n",
