    "body": "In https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=298545.msg3198434#msg3198434, gmaxwell wrote about the danger of sending large numbers of Bitcoins in a single transaction:\n\n> One bitflip while making a transaction with these fat\n> txouts and its $10 million in paper value down the drain.\n\nIs this a real concern?  If a bit gets flipped when broadcasting a transaction, could it cause the transacted coins to become unspendable forever?\n\nIf so, would it be better if transactions contained a checksum, much like bitcoin addresses do, such that random bitflips are detectable?\n",

The last time I tried to use bitcoind to send multiple outputs to a single address it didn't allow it.  Or is it better to make a lot of separate transactions rather than a single transaction with multiple outputs?  Would a bitflip invalidate all the outputs of a single transaction? I guess it could.\n\nMaybe the client should warn if I try to send too large an amount in a single transaction, or even offer to split it into the appropriate amount of smaller transactions.\n\nOr is there some way the client could check the transaction after signing it to make sure it's valid?\n\nI hadn't considered until I read gmaxwell's forum post that it was unsafe to assume that bitcoind would sign transactions correctly.\n",

      "body": "@jgarzik  Verifying the signature does nothing relevant here, alas, as it's not a concern about ecdsa leaking the private key.\n\nThe risk is an error can cause the change addresses to be wrong or cause the values to be wrong. Nothing currently guards against this (though, obviously, it's unlikely). Then it goes on to sign that wrong value, it validates fine, but doesn't do what you want.  We could and should go an verify more after signing, though doing that wouldn't completely eliminate change risk.\n\nThe behavior I was complaining about that Dooglus is talking about is where someone puts 100k btc in a single coin and then makes a bunch of small payments with ~100k change each time.  It's taking a small but unnecessary risk to move huge amounts of coins when the actual amount being moved is small.\n",
