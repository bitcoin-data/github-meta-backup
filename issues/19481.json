    "body": "Hi all!\r\n\r\nAs part of the [anchor outputs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/688) work for Lightning (in the context of [eclair](https://github.com/acinq/eclair)), I'm wondering if it's possible to use psbts and the `bumpfee` RPC or if I'll have to implement a lot of fee bumping code myself outside of `bitcoind`.\r\n\r\nA quick summary of the situation (a lot more details [here](https://github.com/t-bast/lightning-docs/blob/master/lightning-txs.md) if you're interested):\r\n\r\n* we have a \"commit tx\" that represents the state of the channel\r\n* this \"commit tx\" has an output for CPFP carve-out (called \"anchor\") that we use to bump the fee (through a \"claim anchor tx\")\r\n\r\n```ascii\r\n  commit tx\r\n+--------------+\r\n|   vout       |\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n| | output 1 | |\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n|     ...      |\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n| | anchor   | |-------+\r\n| +----------+ |       |         claim anchor tx\r\n|     ...      |       |       +-----------------------------------+\r\n| +----------+ |       |       |   vin               vout          |\r\n| | output n | |       |       | +-------------+   +-------------+ |\r\n| +----------+ |       +------>| | anchor utxo |   | wallet utxo | |\r\n+--------------+               | +-------------+   +-------------+ |\r\n                               | +-------------+                   |\r\n  unrelated tx         +------>| | wallet utxo |                   |\r\n+--------------+       |       | +-------------+                   |\r\n|   vout       |       |       +-----------------------------------+\r\n| +----------+ |       |\r\n| | output 1 | |-------+\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n|     ...      |\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n| | output m | |\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n+--------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `bitcoind` wallet doesn't have the keys necessary to spend the \"anchor\"; these are handled by the lightning node.\r\nBut I'd like to let `bitcoind` chose what inputs and outputs to add to that transaction to achieve a given feerate.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a perfect use-case for PSBT:\r\n\r\n* use `bitcoind`'s `walletcreatefundedpsbt` to obtain a wallet psbt\r\n* create a lightning psbt with only the anchor utxo as input\r\n* use `joinpsbts` to gather all inputs/outputs\r\n* use `walletprocesspsbt` to get signatures for the wallet inputs\r\n* add the signature for the anchor input and finalize the psbt\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, I can publish my \"claim anchor tx\".\r\nHowever if it still doesn't confirm in time, I'd like to RBF that transaction.\r\nBut obviously `bumpfee` will not work out of the box because there's one input that it can't automatically re-sign.\r\nWhat would be really great would be if `bumpfee` could replace all wallet inputs/outputs to bump the fee (abiding by all the BIP 125 rules) and then return a psbt with all the wallet inputs signed; I would then only need to re-sign the anchor input, finalize the psbt and broadcast it.\r\n\r\nIIUC 0.20.0 has taken a first step in that direction (returning a psbt in `bumpfee`), but it looks like it will only do that with a watch-only wallet, whereas I'd like that behavior with normal wallet too. Does this request make sense, and if so is this being currently worked on?",

A caller that works with PSBTs had the finalized PSBT at some point, which allowed him to easily calculate the old fee, so he should be able to provide that parameter to the RPC.\r\n\r\nDo you think it's a reasonable way to implement this?",
