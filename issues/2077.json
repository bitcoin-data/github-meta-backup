The fact that getrawtransaction works, is because we can use the UTXO database to find (for unspent transaction) the confirmations of the transaction, calculate which height that corresponds to, search the block index for the disk location of the block at that height, read that entire block from disk, and look for the transaction you wanted in it. This is not fast, and doesn't work well at all, but it works a bit. However, this database was never designed to do this well. The only thing it is good at is verifying transactions very quickly.\n\nIf you need the ability to look up transactions in the block chain, the only real solution is an index. I really prefer not to mess with the UTXO database to be able to deal with such queries in a bad way.\n",
