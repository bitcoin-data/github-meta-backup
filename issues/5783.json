Take a look at one of your own listening nodes and you'll see that some portion (10-20% in my case) of them never relay any inventory to you. Some have odd behavior like aggressively reconnecting after a ban (Bitcoin Core does not do this), relaying malformed addr rumors, or presenting slightly non-standard subversion strings. \n",

To me it does not make sense like in the case of browser user-agent, but maybe I am missing something.\n\nLook at it also from “server”/full node side. The node is announcing its full version details to the network/its peers. It would be nice to be able to turn this version announcement off (something like ProductOnly to Apache httpd’s ServerTokens - and proudly announcing using of Bitcoin Core/Satoshi) or change the “User Agent” completely. People do so anyway and we should allow this for users of our builds as well.\n\nAnd the name of such option can be `user-agent` (as used in UI) or `subversion`.\n\nBack to the “donation address” for full node. As full node has a static IP address, what about using some form of IN TXT or other entry (we should propose IN BTC anyway ;-) in the reverse DNS zone?\n",

      "body": "Here is an off the cuff proposal, not thought through at all, go knock it down.\n\nWe could use Lighthouse combined with group signatures for this sort of thing, the scheme I'm thinking about is:\n1. 50 people volunteer to run nodes for 6 months if they receive 1 BTC. Their \"peopleness\" can be determined in a contract specific and ad hoc way to make sybils costly, like just requiring people sign in to the organising website with a reasonable looking Facebook profile or something.\n2. Those 50 people each select an address for themselves to receive the funds.\n3. Now the contract goes to crowdfunding. Say 400 people contribute money. The contract is funded.\n4. Once the contract completes, each node operator receives a subkey of a group public key from the organiser of the contract. The group pubkey is published.\n5. We extend the P2P protocol to allow optional signing challenges. The node operators provide their specific private key to bitcoind and a new message is added like \"group?\" which just contains a nonce. The server then signs the nonce with their private key and the resulting signature proves only that the server is a member of the group that was funded, but not which one.\n\nThus, there is no correlation between the Bitcoin address used to raise the money and the IP address of the new node, but it's still proven that the node was funded by the contract.\n\nObviously bitcoind would need some fairly complex new code for this, and responding to the challenges would have to be CPU prioritised lower than actually handling network traffic etc. There are DoS issues to think through. But I think it would satisfy the constraints and avoid a centralised third party who holds the bitcoins for distribution because the contract would pay the node operators directly. The central authority just checks for sybils and admits people into the scheme.\n\nThe main downside is of course complexity. I think realistically such a scheme would have to be a feature of Lighthouse itself. The project file format could be extended to indicate that this is a node-support contract, and then the app could just perform some IP group signature challenges from time to time when it's started and inform the user if a node is unable to respond to the challenge i.e. someone is in violation of the (legal/social) contract.\n\nWe can imagine several extensions of the scheme. For instance instead of paying node operators up front, the contract pays to multisig outputs that are controlled by a dispute mediator who measures uptime, performance and protocol compliance of the nodes.\n",

With the exception of Lighthouse and similar concepts which I think will gain broader acceptance as time goes on.  I hope that perhaps this new discussion might find a way to get giving, or microdonation ideas better integrated into bitcoin.  \n\nCentral to this discussion is the question, should a bitcoin address be tied directly to a node?  I think that development effort should move more away from doing that. Which is to say, development efforts should protect people from having their node associated with any particular address (loosely expressed, the deanonymization concern).\n\nEdit:  See also [Pull Request #253](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/253).\n",
