    "title": "Address changes should be visible to the user",
    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI lost a significant amount of bitcoin because bitcoinqt made transactions I never gave permission to: address changes. I assumed this software was unix-like, that basically it was good software. But because of the address changes, which are not signalled to the user, it is not.\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\n\r\nBitcoin private keys are artefacts of the bitcoin network. This is what the user own and is entitled too when he gets bitcoin.\r\nBitcoin wallets are NOT artefacts of the network, they are not part of the network at all. From the point of view of the network, they are artefact of a 3rd party software. The user may use them, but he doesnt own bitcoin because he owns a wallet, the user owns bitcoins because he owns private keys.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when bitcoinqt makes transaction - address changes - without warning the user, it is a clear breach of unix-like trust - for a lack of better terms.\r\n\r\nBitcoinqt should be unix-like. It should be fully transparent to the user, and not try to appeal to the mass. It should not be up to another software to fulfill that role.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nJust make the address changes visible.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nI can understand the mistake has been made at the beginning of bitcoin. Bitcoin was supposed to appeal to the mass in order to be used in mass consumption. It is still a mistake, but it is understandable. Today, we know it will never be used to buy a macdonald meal (beside the use of 3rd party software which make you think you do).",

Otherwise, maybe extending the documentation for importprivkey?\r\n\r\nPlease dont waste your time because of my ignorance :)\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think I've found that it is missing a unix-an doc that answers question like: \"how do you own bitcoins?\". In that case, when I look at a wallet, it awfully looks like a 3rd-party software artefact, whereas private keys looks like the thing I should only worry about. I now understand that you own bitcoins by owning a wallet and thats because, actually, of those change addresses. Correct me if Im wrong but if you \"remove\" the change addresses, you \"remove\" the wallets. Im not suggesting you should actually remove change addresses which makes no sense, I understand now the tech works like this; all Im saying is that wallets are here because change address are here, the whole thing being rooted in the tech. That defines wallets (how many users, particularly the tech savvy ones, could tell what wallets are really for?). A unix-an want to learn that quickly, during his user experience.\r\nAlso, I think it's missing some unix-an hints of whats happening during bitcoin core execution: I would expect to literally see the change address mechanism for each transactions, importprivkey included. Right now, importprivkey output things on the console (a \"null\") but doesnt output anything on the app. The app should log visibly everything that's happening, I think. When you grep or curl or whatever, you get to see everything right? :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, ultimately, Im sure those information are available somewhere, therefore the mistake is on me.",

      "body": "> Correct me if Im wrong but if you \"remove\" the change addresses, you \"remove\" the wallets. Im not suggesting you should actually remove change addresses which makes no sense, I understand now the tech works like this; all Im saying is that wallets are here because change address are here, the whole thing being rooted in the tech. That defines wallets (how many users, particularly the tech savvy ones, could tell what wallets are really for?).\r\n\r\nThe wallet is not just change addresses, and there is more than one address in a wallet that you use to receive Bitcoin with. Most modern wallets (including Bitcoin Core) will generate a new address for every time you want to receive Bitcoin. It will also generate new change addresses whenever a change address is required. All a wallet is is a collection of private keys, and your Bitcoin can be associated with any of the private keys in a wallet. So once you import a private key into a wallet, that wallet as a whole contains your Bitcoin, not just the singular private key you imported.\r\n\r\n> A unix-an want to learn that quickly, during his user experience.\r\n\r\nAll of this information is documented on multiple websites. Bitcoin.org is a good resource for this type of stuff. There really is no need for any unix documentation, especially since the vast majority of users are not using any form of unix.\r\n\r\n> The app should log visibly everything that's happening, I think. When you grep or curl or whatever, you get to see everything right? :)\r\n\r\nMost of the things you are asking for are logged in the debug.log file. There is no need to print that out to the console as it is kind of useless and will add extra information that may confuse the user. It will especially make it more difficult to understand what is just logging output and what is the actual result of the command.",
