    "body": "Most fuzz engines use coverage signals (for example line coverage or edge coverage) to determine which fuzz inputs to keep. This works generally well, unless the fuzzed logic is stateful.\r\n\r\nOne example is the script interpreter / script parsing. I believe there is no difference in coverage signals between a `1-of-1` multisig and a `1-of-16` multisig, which is presumably why it took several months to find a bug in the script fuzz target: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=39152\r\n\r\nThere is `-use_value_profile=1`, which might help a bit here, but apparently it didn't help enough.\r\n\r\nI am wondering what the best way is to address this shortcoming, so that it is possible to find the above bug (and similar ones) in less CPU time?\r\n\r\ncc @guidovranken @agroce @practicalswift ",

      "body": "@MarcoFalke \r\n\r\n# Input size control\r\n\r\nLimit the maximum size (libFuzzer flag: `-max_len=N`). In my experience the vast majority of bugs for most fuzzers (in general) can be constructed with very small files (in the order of several hundreds of bytes). I think OSS-Fuzz uses a `max_len` of 1 megabyte which is far too large for most targets. The benefit of limiting the max input size to 4KB or smaller is that the search space in terms of volume becomes much smaller, each mutation has more chance of making a meaningful change and hitting a bug. `-max_len=4096` is often demonstrably faster in finding bugs than say `-max_len=1048576` The only downside of a hard limit is that you will miss bugs which can only be expressed with an input larger than the hard limit.\r\n\r\nlibFuzzer by default favors smaller inputs and gradually move towards larger inputs. This is controlled by the `len_control` flag:\r\n\r\n```\r\n len_control                         \t100\tTry generating small inputs first, then try larger inputs over time.  Specifies the rate at which the length limit is increased (smaller == faster).  If 0, immediately try inputs with size up to max_len. Default value is 0, if LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator is used.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if a hard limit is not desirable you can consider tweaking `len_control`.\r\n\r\n# Extra counters\r\n\r\nYou can use an additional coverage signal by defining (at the global scope, and use `extern \"C\" {}` when using C++):\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nextern \"C\" {\r\n__attribute__((section(\"__libfuzzer_extra_counters\")))\r\nuint8_t bitcoin_extra_counters[1024];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nlibFuzzer will see this on startup and use its contents as an additional signal. You don't need to memset it to 0 each iteration, libFuzzer does that for you.\r\n\r\nYou can use some arbitrary logic to signal progress to libFuzzer, e.g.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nextern \"C\" {\r\n__attribute__((section(\"__libfuzzer_extra_counters\")))\r\nuint64_t  bitcoin_multisig_size;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand in the script code\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nbitcoin_multisig_size = multisig_size;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively or additionally you can consider hashing some core characteristics of the script environment, for example opcode + program counter + stack size, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nextern \"C\" {\r\n__attribute__((section(\"__libfuzzer_extra_counters\")))\r\nuint8_t bitcoin_extra_counters[65535];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand in the script instruction loop:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nbitcoin_extra_counters[ (op^pc^stack.size()) % 65535 ] ++;\r\n```\r\n\r\nor something to that effect.\r\n\r\nThis ought to signal the VM state more accurately to libFuzzer and should expedite the bug finding.\r\n\r\nSome fuzzers even work *exclusively* using extra counters, such as go-fuzz in libFuzzer mode: https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/blob/4980593459a186bd2a389fe4557a260cce742594/go-fuzz-build/main.go#L857-L863\r\nAnd this works very well.",

      "body": "Thanks for all the responses.\r\n\r\nI looked a bit more at the particular multisig problem and suspect the issue is that multisig is too structured for a fuzz engine to quickly figure it out.\r\n\r\nBasically, it needs to guess:\r\n* OP_n, where n is *exactly* the number of pubkeys\r\n* The serialization of n pubkeys (Correct serialized length before the serialized byte vector, and inside the byte vector, the correct `CPubKey::GetLen()` prefix)\r\n* OP_k and no further opcodes\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be too hard for the fuzz engine to find an 1-of-1 multisig with the help of `use_value_profile`. Though, extending it even to 1-of-2 multisig is quite a lot harder, since it requires to guess the correct OP_n *and* a correctly pushed pubkey at the right position.\r\n\r\nI tried aiding the fuzz engine by reworking `ConsumeScript` to keep a byte buffer which may be reused. I suspected that this will make it possible to find a 1-of-2 multisig in less than 100 CPU hours on my laptop. Without success I aborted after 200-300 CPU hours.\r\n\r\nI also tried using a dictionary with pubkeys as entries. This didn't seem to improve either.\r\n\r\nFinally, adding an explicit path to `ConsumeScript` to \"fake\" a multisig worked the best. See  #23408.\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing this for now, but feel free to continue the discussion if there is anything to add.",
