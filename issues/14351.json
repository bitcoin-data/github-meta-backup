    "body": "I was trying to test the new `blocksdir` option from #12653 but could not get it to work regardless of whether I set it in the config file or passed `-blocksdir` as an argument. `blocksdir` shows up in `bitcoind --help` so it should be working, but every time I tried the opening log output would show LevelDB loading from the default `~/.bitcoin/blocks` dir where there were no blocks, and then error out immediately.\r\n\r\nI'm using a symlinked directory currently instead and that works, fwiw.\r\n\r\nThis is on Ubuntu 18.04, compiled from 0.17.0-rc4 on an Odroid-HC2 32 bit arm device. The setup I'm using has the main `.bitcoin` datadir on an SSD and the `blocks` directory on an HDD.",
