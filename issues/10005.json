Here is a gist of the entire debug.log @TheBlueMatt https://gist.github.com/sheldonth/2ba09ba625375bee7f2f64957ca4fe10\r\n\r\nI have yet to be able to get the QT UI to appear. I am using 0.14 -- one factor to note is that my bitcoin data directory is on an external drive which also had Time Machine backups start on it (automatically) while bitcoin was trying to open. I realized this morning that I was simultaneously Time Machine'ing a backup onto the same drive that Bitcoin was working off of. I wonder if that could've casued the locks referred to above. Since I can currently reproduce the problem I will try starting bitcoin with the -debug flag and sending any other logs over. ",

      "body": "So it seems the point where it blocks on cs_main has been moved from during the splash screen (albeit with the wrong message) to the handover between the splash screen and the GUI. Somewhat awkward. Seems a well-meant change made the user experience (in some cases) worse.\r\n\r\nIdeally we should never block the GUI on anything that requires cs_main. That's non-trivial, though, as e.g. getting the wallet transaction list from the core requires that lock, and showing the window but not showing transactions is not nice either... (though it could show e.g. a \"Fetching transactions...\" overlay).\r\n\r\nAlso we should find a solution to the validation thread starving other threads of any access to cs_main. It drops the lock but not for long enough for anyone else to have a chance to grab it (?). \"pthread_yield\" didn't seem to solve it either from tests in #8117. Maybe adding a delay is the only option, but that's quite ugly as it would slow down the validation progress... :/",
