All existing financial software can deal/store big numbers but typically only 2 decimals.\n3. Split could be linked with the introduction of the ISO code in one step.\"\n\nIt does not look like item 3 is feasible, but the first two are a strong rationale.  Existing financial software trying to integrate bitcoin must convert decimal places, with all that entails (accounting and bitcoin numbers \"look\" different to outsider auditors).\n\nHumans in general seem to deal with large numbers for small values (Yen) better than fractional ones (bitcoin).\n",

      "body": "I generally like this more than microbtc, but I think many people are preferring microbtc at the moment because both \"typical values\" and their reciprocals are attractive numbers. And as cozz points out (by showing how much usd a µBTC costs on the open market), the reciprocal is really not a nice number right now.   Arguably it will be in the future if bitcoin grows in success, and we might as well design for that future— since if it doesn't the decision doesn't matter so much.\n\nThe other downside is that by keeping the point you guarantee that people will continue to write financial software using radix-2 floating point and getting bad and or surprising results.  Just food for though.\n",

Only then it makes sense to discuss it as default.\n\n(edit: this may sound overly negative, to be clear I'm in favor of moving to uBTC display eventually, but changing the default in bitcoin-qt should not be the first step)\n",

Few financial systems support 8 dp and this convention is a barrier in the path of Bitcoin's growth.\n\nBecause XBT has already some momentum there is a case for another new ISO code, hence:\n\nXBT = 1 Bitcoin\nXBU = 1 microbitcoin\n\nIf XBU is supported internally within Bitcoin Core then the benefits of 2dp can be realized. The GUI should probably default to BTC but allow XBT and XBU as user selectable options.\n",

It has nothing to do with the exchange rate, it's that there is apparently a non-trivial amount of software which cannot handle money values smaller than 0.01  (because, e.g. it does all calculation with integers normalized by 100). CNY, JPY, etc. don't present this issue. I believe the highest currency base unit in use— other than BTC— is only a couple of times more valuable than the USD.\n",

      "body": "A whole lot of sites and software already use 1 XBT == 1 BTC. It's too late to redefine that.\n\nThe GUI already allows people to change to mBTC or uBTC if they prefer to use that. Why force mBTC on people? Bitcoinity currently forces mBTC (and they are alone in doing that) on people and it's just annoying to have to change it back to BTC to get a sane display.\n\nPlease don't force those using the \"official\" client to have to change this frequently too.\n\nAnd this \"financial software only supports only 2 decimals\" story seems to be a myth. Please give some actual examples of this supposed software. It's 2014. Computers can handle more than 2 decimals just fine. This BS story sounds like the year 2000 problem. The world did not end when we went from 1999 to 2000. If some outdated financial software seriously can't handle more than 2 decimals then that's a bug in their software that they should fix.\n\nI personally don't care too much what you do as long as Armory and the exchanges doesn't go along with this.\n",

      "body": "Why should µBTC be the \"final\" unit? The Japanese yen uses no decimal points at all. Wouldn't that be preferable? All integers. Satoshis should be the \"final\" unit. It's even a Japanese-sounding name, like yen. But we're not there yet in terms of value.\n\nAnd I have to disapprove of the proposal for XBT to be defined differently than BTC. It's already been established that XBT is synonymous with BTC and even that it's \"more correct\" in some senses, as \"BTC\" would indicate some as-yet-undefined currency from the country of Bhutan. The imminently opening Coinfloor exchange in the UK uses \"XBT\" consistently throughout its site.\n\nFinally, it doesn't make sense for Bitcoin to have two ISO currency codes, e.g., XBT and XBU. No other ISO currency in the world has separate codes for different multiples of the same currency. It would be a waste of the code space.\n",

      "body": "@rcornea respectfully have to disagree - there is a ton of legacy software that is NOT going to be rewritten just because some new kid on the block wants integration.\n\nA lot of people seem to think that this conversation is around exchanges and the like. That is simply not the case - software like that will already be capable of a large number of decimal places. This is more for something like an accounting package. Virtually all of the SME accounting packages out there support 2 decimal places. There are no bookkeeping transactions that require more. If you're charging interest on a late account you round up or round down to the nearest cent, and that final value is what is stored. No accounting software will bill a client $10.42 in interest but actually store it as 10.418394887439.\n\nThe same goes for point of sales systems (POS), such as at a bar or restaurant. Many of them support multiple currencies, but do not support more than 2 decimal places. If you have a table at a restaurant and you charge a % surcharge for 8+ seaters, the POS will calculate it and round to the nearest cent. That 2 decimal place value is what is presented on the bill, it is what is paid, and it is what is stored in the accounting backend.\n\nI think this makes complete sense - let's rip the band-aid and make it happen. If there are sites using 1 XBT == 1 BTC they are not common, and their developers will surely have no problem changing the nomenclature of the site back to BTC. We've discussed this around the dev team and nobody has even stumbled across a site actively using XBT in that manner (admittedly a small sample size and thus anecdotal, but nonetheless).\n",

He makes two addresses: one associated with the choice of switching defaults to micro-BTC and one with the choice of leaving defaults to BTC. A time limit is set for voting. The address that gets more coins is the most supported choice and gets implemented. All coins are sent to the chosen charity.

      "body": "OK I give it another try.\nAt least there is agreement on the fact that a BTC as of today has too many decimals to be used by non-techies to pay for grocery.\nAlso it seems that the ISO code for XBT = 1 BTC is already in use and no one is in favour of going to Bloomberg and ask them to change their charting.\nThen how about we use megasatoshis (e.g. megasats) and kilosatoshis (e.g. kilosats). 1 megasat = 1 hundredth of a BTC = 1000 kilosats = buys you at least one beer in most countries as of today.\nWhen/if megasats become grossly inadequate as a unit of measure for beers, then, in time, we can switch to kilosats. Or gigasats.\n\nIMHO the reference QT bitcoin client matters and has to lead the way because it is the reference client.\n",

      "body": "I find this discussion mildly amusing because there appears to be a consensus amongst developers that a successful (is no longer an experiment) bitcoin won't be used by normal people for daily transactions (cup of coffee, newspaper, etc.). This builds atop the fact that bitcoin is already unusable for micro transactions as it simply doesn't (and will never again) scale to transactions of hundredths of a US cent.\n\nInstead, so their theory goes, bitcoin will become a settlement currency. It will be used to trade value amongst trusted systems or amongst contract participants (escrow, smart contracts, coloured coins etc.)\n\nSo it's a bit dishonest talking about the perceptions of the man in the street, if the man in the street is merely a vehicle to move bitcoin out of its experimental phase into its settlement-currency phase.\n\nAlso, if the programmers who are interfacing bitcoin with \"financial systems\" can't grok that bitcoin is an integer in the range 0 to 2,100,000,000,000,000 (approximately :-) then we're fucking doomed.\n\nI wish Satoshi had defined more significant digits (at least 6 more) and I wish the developers didn't view the ultimate future as being that of a settlement-currency, i.e. that scalability to micro transactions was a goal.\n\nBut we're stuck with what we've got and the maths of scalability are hard to argue with. Within, say, 10 years bitcoin will be solely a settlement currency if it survives as a medium of exchange. Humans will be transacting in other currencies (pegged or floating, closed-trusted or open peer-to-peer) against bitcoin. Bitcoin the currency will disappear from plain sight in the same way as SWIFT or BACS.\n\nSo in my view, this is merely a middle-term user-interface problem - and it should be recognised as such. There is no future in which we get an extra 6 digits of precision, so there's no need to worry about whether we might have to \"shift the decimal point _again_\". There will never be micro transactions, because of scalability, so humans are going to stop transacting peer-to-peer in bitcoins eventually, anyway.\n\nWith all that understood, \"bit\" really does seem like the most human-friendly name for the middle term. \"dorian\" would be my close second vote. \n\nMost people still don't know what a megabyte is and no, I don't mean that most people can't work out whether it's 1,000,000 bytes or 1,048,576 bytes. I mean that they don't know the scale, whether mega is a thousand or a million or something else.\n\nCounting zeroes left of the decimal point is only mildly less painful than counting those right of it: a cup of tea that currently costs 0.0025 BTC would cost 2500 bits. \n\nCounting fees in bits is definitely amusing: currently the suggested fee is  0.1 bits per byte :) And the proposed new fee is 100 bytes per bit.\n\nMaybe dorians is the way to go after all.\n\nRegardless, a commonly agreed unit corresponding with 100 satoshis appears to be a step forward in easing the adoption of bitcoin the currency.\n\ntldr: dorian may be the least confusing name for 100 satoshis, for the period that humans are still transacting in bitcoin before (if) it becomes a settlement currency.\n",

      "body": "@jgarzik Maybe I should have been clearer, as I'm referring to the values and fees associated with **on-blockchain** micro transactions, not off-blockchain micro transactions. I'm familiar with the thread you linked and its technique to route around scalability issues presented by the blockchain itself. In fact that thread defines a use-case for bitcoin as a settlement currency :)\n\nOff-blockchain transactions means there will be no pressure to add significant digits. And payment channels are a trust-less though very close neighbour of trusted payment services/channels (such as that offered by Coinbase, where customers of Coinbase can transact in bitcoin without hitting the blockchain). The currency seen by the user of the latter kind of channel is not necessarily bitcoin and it seems to me that trustless channels for micro transactions can be denominated in something else that's directly convertible to bitcoin, so that settlements are all that's needed on bitcoin's blockchain.\n\nAnyway, I support a unit of 100 satoshis, for whatever timespan people individually interact with the blockchain.\n\n---\n\nI've been running the reference client (and mining) for nearly 3 years - thanks for your and others' hard work.\n",

      "body": "@laanwj while it's true in theory, I think at this stage, decision made by devs could help community a lot. You guys are still the most respectable source in this community, and if you decide we should name things one way or another, it will likely stick. Even within this discussion you can see how coining the term satoshi for the smallest unit helped a lot. But it was easier when community was smaller. \n\nI know you have a lot of cooler and more important stuff to care about in the core. But just as you think about how core changes may influence future scalability, it may be helpful to think how they may influence future widespread adoption. It's not up to you, but it can be.\n\nMost people just don't know SI units. It's a fact that seems weird when you are surrounded by tech/science people. Even for for those who do, 0.00005 requires a bit longer to process than 500 000. Use of small fractions is so unpopular, that we don't even have any standard way to separate these zeroes.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for dropping in without code here, I do believe that this decision should be based on devs rational thinking and not some community polls, because a single person voice (who takes time to think things through) is much more valuable than 50 other people who just act like a swarm. Keep up the good work.\n",

It just doesn't work - we're inevitably going to come up with something 90% of the actual Bitcoin-using population thinks is awkward or even ridiculous just by the fact that we're not them and don't understand their worldview. If users feel the need to talk about uBTC they _will_ switch - it's just an option. If they don't, they don't. Trying to figure out what's right with anything less than a top-tier advertising/design firm is bound to fail - this stuff is legitimately hard and those consultants genuinely earn their money.
