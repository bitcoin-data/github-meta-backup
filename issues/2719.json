I tried un installing and re installing several times and with a couple of the past versions. When I tried 7.2 I could get the client to launch and the ctransactions all matched, however, I tried looking for the /Application Support/Bitcoin/ folder, and it's still missing. It seems like something is preventing the directory from being created during install..? I have my back up wallet.dat file else where and I did trying moving around but nothing seems to work.\n",
