    "body": "I'm not sure if this is a regression of the fix to issue #156, or if it's a new bug.  For now, I've written up the description in a new comment on issue #156 (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/156#issuecomment-54737468), because it seems very likely that this is a regression of the older bug.  But if that's wrong, then I guess there's a shiny new seg fault instead.\n\nHope this helps, and please let me know if there's some better procedure I should have followed.\n",

This is with the exact same bitcoin sources (commit 93193c8) with which I was able to reproduce the bug every time yesterday.\n\nSo I strongly suspect this was just a bug in the Debian-packaged version of libminiupnpc-dev in the 'testing' distro.  Closing this ticket for now; if it reoccurs, I'll re-open.\n",
