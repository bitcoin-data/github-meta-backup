    "title": "createwallet allows you to create many wallets for the same external signer",
    "body": "While testing external signers in `22.0rc2`, I noticed that I can create many watch only wallets with the external signer option, each with a different name, but they will all be tied to the same external signer. Not sure if this should be a bug, but it is definitely unexpected and leads to misleading information in the GUI/RPC commands. At the very least, perhaps all that's needed is better documentation on how external signers work with Bitcoin Core to avoid confusion, which I'd be happy to write.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIf createwallet allows me to create 3 different wallets with different names, I expect them to be different wallets:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -signet listwallets\r\n[\r\n  \"trezor_1\",\r\n  \"trezor_2\",\r\n  \"trezor_3\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a wallet has already been created with the existing external signer, I would expect new wallet creation to fail, even if the wallet name is different, or create a new wallet on the same external signer but be under a different account (derviation path)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe three wallets above are all attached to the same external signer and account, even tho they are shown as separate wallets in the cli and the gui.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -signet -rpcwallet=trezor_1 getwalletinfo\r\n{\r\n  \"walletname\": \"trezor_1\",\r\n  \"walletversion\": 169900,\r\n  \"format\": \"sqlite\",\r\n  \"balance\": 0.01799890,\r\n  \"unconfirmed_balance\": 0.00000000,\r\n  \"immature_balance\": 0.00000000,\r\n  \"txcount\": 7,\r\n  \"keypoolsize\": 3000,\r\n  \"keypoolsize_hd_internal\": 3000,\r\n  \"paytxfee\": 0.00000000,\r\n  \"private_keys_enabled\": false,\r\n  \"avoid_reuse\": true,\r\n  \"scanning\": false,\r\n  \"descriptors\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -signet -rpcwallet=trezor_2 getwalletinfo\r\n{\r\n  \"walletname\": \"trezor_2\",\r\n  \"walletversion\": 169900,\r\n  \"format\": \"sqlite\",\r\n  \"balance\": 0.01799890,\r\n  \"unconfirmed_balance\": 0.00000000,\r\n  \"immature_balance\": 0.00000000,\r\n  \"txcount\": 7,\r\n  \"keypoolsize\": 3000,\r\n  \"keypoolsize_hd_internal\": 3000,\r\n  \"paytxfee\": 0.00000000,\r\n  \"private_keys_enabled\": false,\r\n  \"avoid_reuse\": true,\r\n  \"scanning\": false,\r\n  \"descriptors\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Setup HW wallet using an external signer. The steps I followed are here: https://gist.github.com/josibake/9799b348e261e81881fa621d0c9d8dfb#testing-wallet-changes\r\n\r\n2. Create two separate wallets with the same external signer\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -signet createwallet \"trezor_1\" true true \"\" true true true true\r\n./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -signet createwallet \"trezor_2\" true true \"\" true true true true\r\n```\r\n3. Send a transaction to one of the wallets\r\n4. Verify both wallets have the same transaction listed using `getwalletinfo`\r\n5. If you have previous transactions on the external signer, you will need to run `rescanblockchain` for each and you can also verify they have exactly the same information\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nUsing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v22.0rc2 (self compiled) on:\r\n\r\nOS: Pop!_OS 20.10 (Ubuntu 20.10)\r\nOS Type: 64 bit\r\nGNOME: 3.83.3\r\n",

IMO the act of creating an external signer wallet is equivalent to an explicit import. It's not a default action - you have to explicitly choose to create an external signer wallet, in the same way that importing is an explicit decision. The difference is instead of looking at the thing being imported you are just telling Bitcoin Core to figure out what to import automatically. In both cases, you are choosing to make duplicate wallets; when importing, you choose to import the same thing, when using an external signer, you choose to use the same external signer.\r\n\r\n> AFAIK, this is different from before in that I could not create an HD wallet, and then create a new wallet based off the same seed such that all new addresses would now appear in both wallets. This seems to go against the idea of wallets being independent containers.\r\n\r\nActually you can, although it's a little bit more complicated. You can get the seed for a wallet via `dumpwallet`, then create a new blank wallet, and then use `sethdseed` so the new wallet has exactly the same keys as the original.",
