    "body": "Currently these take up around 37GB on a full node, and as far as I can tell they are only used for stats and large reorgs. It would be nice if there was an option to prune these past a minimum of 288 (MIN_BLOCKS_TO_KEEP) blocks if the user:\r\n\r\n- does not care for these stats\r\n- is not worried about large reorgs\r\n- doesn't want to prune blocks\r\n\r\nAs a side note: txindices currently use 10GB *less* space than this data.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like you can just delete these files either: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/71272/are-old-rev-dat-file-safely-deletable",
