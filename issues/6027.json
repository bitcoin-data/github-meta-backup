Do you guys really think we have nothing better to do than waste our entire disk space for your client and wait forever to download bitcoin history??? You can be sure that in a year when it will be more than 100 GB in size - NO ONE EVER except freaks will use your client because it will become absolutely unusable...\n",

      "body": "The disk space required for Bitcoin Core (about 48 GB) costs about $2 today, and the initial download only needs to be done once. If the node sync makes your computer unusable, this is a problem with your operating system managing resources poorly - you may wish to try upgrading it.\n\nIt is not our problem if you don't want to use Bitcoin: other \"clients\" are _not_ Bitcoin; they only remotely access Bitcoin Core nodes, and compromise your security and privacy to varying degrees by trusting those other nodes.\n\nThat being said, the huge conceptual to-do list does include at least making the wallet work as a remote/trusting node while it does the sync in the background - but it isn't a high priority item for anyone AFAIK. If that is important to you, you may wish to create a bounty to fund its development.\n",

      "body": "Maybe this isn't clear from Luke's response, but Bitcoin Core is not the\nonly program interacting with the Bitcoin network, and certainly not the\nonly way to send and receive coins.\n\nBitcoin was designed to support different security/trust models. One of\nthem is running a full node, like Bitcoin Core implements. This gives you\nthe highest level of protection and security against fraudulent\ntransactions. In addition, it helps other clients get their data. The\ndownside is that this requires verifying and storing all transactions\n(though a reduced mode where they are still downloaded and verified, but\nnot stored forever, is in the works).\n\nAs said, if you're trade in some security for convenience, other software\nis likely a better choice for you. See the bitcoin.org website.\n",
