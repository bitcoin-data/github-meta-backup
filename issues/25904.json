    "body": "Some possibly invalid input miniscripts may cause the miniscript evaluator to misbehave:\r\n- when compiling in debug mode, at least we get an assertion failure (the program will crash and exit).\r\n- when compiling in the release, that function may return some random std::string reference, causing UB.\r\n\r\nSee the lamda fucntion starting on src/script/miniscript.h:571.\r\n\r\nDetected by gcc during compilation with -Wreturn-type. But as it is in a lambda, itself hidden in a template, it was hard to see at the location indicated (which is just the 1st line of the lambda missing some valid return).\r\n\r\nSo the final `assert(false);` is insufficient, it should at least be an exception that can be caught, or some valid string such as \"\" (depending on the expected semantics).\r\n",

      "body": "I used mingw because that is what you document and support for building the Windows version. It was done on the same OS (Debian Bullseye) on which I have also compiled the Linux version (the only difference being the HOST=* parameter for specifying a target.\r\n\r\nI have not tried Clang instead of gcc, jsut used the default compiler automatically selected by your existing documented settings. so I also did not try to compile the Windows version with Visual Studio (I've tried it once, and found no easy way to configure it correctly... too many dependencies, and Visual Studio is quite unstable in its own requirements, and updates too often, and like any compiler could have its own bugs at any time, that will be hard to reproduce by someone else, especuialyl when working with the master development git sources which change some details every few days).\r\n\r\nMay be I should stick on using a stable branch 23.x instead of the latest head with \"git pull\", but I'm not sure that it gets updated with backports for all possible bug resolutions rapidly tested in the master dev branch.\r\n\r\nI'm still looking for causes of bugs/hangs that exist and persist in the Windows released versions 22.0 or 23.0 trying to isolate them. It's not easy, and won't be easy if you also don't support \"mingw\" as a \"vanilla\" environment.\r\n\r\nSo which environment or settings do you recommend for testing/debugging the Windows version? Do you even support Windows?\r\n\r\nOr do you support just plain Linux with LTS releases (also working well in stable and supported hypervisors or on wellknown hosting providers), such as RHEL8, AlmaLinux, Oracle Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, or possibly PopOS and Mint...\r\n\r\nBut probably not Fedora, not CentOS Stream (replacing CentOS which is no longer supported, but \"CentOS Stream\" is no longer \"stable\", looking much like a rolling release even if it is a bit slower and more tested), and certainly not popular distribs using \"rolling releases\" (which no one should use for BitCoin Core), and not \"custom\" kernels tuned for specific hardware and specific apps (like Gentoo, which may be extremely stable but too highly personalized with highly variable dependencies that are difficult and very lengthy to configure and test, even if there are Gentoo-based or ArchLinux-based distribs offering precompiled binaries: these special \"custom\" distribs require a very solid PC, lot of RAM, fast storage, a fast CPU with many cores, so they are only for some costly \"high-en\" PC's used by \"geekies\" at home that are looking for tweaks to get extreme performances in specific apps, or used in professional developement labs for designing new systems with months of development and solid teams).\r\n\r\nI don't say that Bitcoin Core will not work on these distribs but there's no warranty, unless their users have very good technical knowledge and experience of their system (and have enough time to invest on them and ara capable to reproduce and isolate their problems, something that most users will not be able to do). Even me, I have not used C++ extensively since long to follow how its \"standard\" evolved. My C++ skills are still very classic and today I no longer use it for most things (I prefer using C most of the time, as it is much more \"stable\" and ahve little \"magic\" and new subtle semantics to hide). Most of the changes made in C++ are in fact already reflected in other languages (like Python, PHP, Java...) whose performance is now largely sufficient without taking many security risks difficult to solve. I'ev seen that you are now experimenting with C++20, but as now you use C++17, you are far more advanced than me about it.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that you may have difficulty to recruit more testers and to provide guiding for candidates: your code is really very complex (and I find Bitcoin Core sources even more complex to understand than the Linux kernel itself, even if it's much smaller; even the sources for Qt is simpler for me to work with, as it is more modular and has much more documentation, and lot of online help if needed).\r\n\r\nBut I have noted your current efforts to modularize your sources (thanks for that), and possibly develop your existing support with more volunteers.",
