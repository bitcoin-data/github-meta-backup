The impact of this is that certain functions done upon receipt of verack therefore do not happen.

And What exactly is the purpose of verack? What should be done before a verack is sent and what should be dependent on a verack being received?\n",

I assume (but have not established for a fact) that this is already the case for Core. \n\n> Ok, I realize all these examples are the same node, ...\n\nYour logs show ~~four~~ one peer is misbehaving and reconnecting as <peer> 2, 8, 11 and 4. Do you mean that you have only observed these premature `verack` messages on the node whose logs you quote above, or only from that IP address?\n",

      "body": "@rebroad, `version` sets `pfrom->fSuccessfullyConnected` and the subsequent `verack` sets state `fCurrentlyConnected = true`, so the implication of _not_ sending a `verack` ensues from there.\n\nWhichever way, according to main.cpp, the node in your example gets punished (presumably for the incoming `verack` in response to the local node's initiating `version` message). The `verack` is correctly logged as FAILED since it arrived _before_ the obligatory `version` message - which arrives but is never verack'd - and an eventual connection timeout should result.\n\nAt the risk of seeming rude, I have to agree with @sipa that self-study is a basic requirement in this project. All of the above information is apparent from the code. Sometimes it is easy to just ask the general audience in Github, but consider that _everyone_ subscribed to this project receives _every_ comment via email. If the person asking the question shows that they have not done the required foundation or research reading away from this repository, then rudimentary questions can break concentration, distract, or even be plain annoying. Instead of spraying with a machine gun, we should do homework on our own and then snipe issues and bugs like a self-sufficient sharpshooter. That way no-one has to \"carry\" someone else and the work is autonomous and a contribution.\n\nThe node in your logs is behaving irregularly. There may be many reasons for that - the primary being that it is running modified code or that it is an alternative implementation that masquerades as a Satoshi client.\n\nI must mention that in the time since your original comment I have tested outbound connections to a 0.11.1 client without sending `verack` and the peer connections persisted beyond timeout, with the remote node seemingly \"forgiving\" the incomplete handshake. 0.12.1 behaves as in your logs and times out a connection that is not verack'd. So your comment is useful despite lacking due diligence on your part.\n",

      "body": "@venzen I'm running 0.13 and my node isn't timing out connections that don't send a verack... I've not managed to locate the code which is supposed to do that - I will have another look for it. I also don't receive any emails from github for updates to issues, so I wasn't aware other people did. I'll try to figure out why this is too - I would expect that people only subscribe to these comments when they click the subscribe button to the right (or perhaps they subscribe automatically when they comment).\n\nOk, looking at my the latest HEAD, when a verack is received, if fNetworkNode is set (I'm not clear why we need this variable - are you?) fCurrentlyConnected is also set to true. This variable is used only by main.cpp and only used in 4 places. (1. where it's defined. 2. where it's initialised to false. 3. In FinalizeNode which is only run when a node is already being disconnected, and finally 4. Setting it to true when receiving the verack!) so therefore, verack doesn't appear to form any part of any disconnection logic, and fCurrentlyConnected seems to be a pretty redundant variable.\n\nIf I've overlooked anything, please feel free to let me know, but I do think I've been doing my research!\n",
