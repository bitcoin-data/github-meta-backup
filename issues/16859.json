    "title": "Syncing headers with feeler-peers",
    "body": "It occurred to me that we should eliminate the distinction between feelers -- peers we connect to on average every couple minutes to test entries in addrman -- and the extra outbound peers we connect to if our tip is stale (#11560).  Instead, why not just sync headers with feeler connections, and if we happen to learn of a new block from that feeler when our tip had been stale, consider evicting an older connection (just as we do with our extra outbounds)?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this should increase the cost to an adversary trying to eclipse a node, because they'd need to control a large fraction of the addrman in order to withhold the most-work chain for any sizeable amount of time.\r\n\r\nMoreover since we're already making these feeler connections already, it should be a small amount of additional bandwidth to sync headers with such a peer.  (Perhaps we should avoid doing this in IBD...?)\r\n\r\n@EthanHeilman Any thoughts?",

This depends, however, on actually accepting the block before disconnecting anyone.\r\n\r\nOne simple way to implement that is that eviction could just eliminate outbound peer which least recently sent us a block we accepted (and if none have, the most recently connected).  The block-denying-header-making attack would then do nothing interesting, as the new connection would be the one that got evicted even if we learned a header from it.\r\n\r\nSuhas may have been assuming this because the existing stale tip eviction works that way... if the new stale tip peer didn't help us after all, it'll be the one that gets evicted.\r\n\r\n> I'm not familiar with the precise definition of what makes something a stale tip.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11560\r\n",

      "body": "I'm kinda thinking out loud here so I apologize for any important details I might have missed.\r\n\r\nThanks for that link, if I understand the code correctly after 30 minutes if no block has been announced to us our tip becomes stale.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstatic bool TipMayBeStale(const Consensus::Params &consensusParams) EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_main)\r\n{\r\n    AssertLockHeld(cs_main);\r\n    if (g_last_tip_update == 0) {\r\n        g_last_tip_update = GetTime();\r\n    }\r\n    return g_last_tip_update < GetTime() - consensusParams.nPowTargetSpacing * 3 && mapBlocksInFlight.empty();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net_processing.cpp#L570-L577\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the proposed behavior in this issue:\r\n====\r\n\r\nWhen we make a feeler connection to a node A and it has a new block *AND* our tip is stale, we evict one of our outgoing connections and replace the connection with node A. Assuming I didn't bork up the math the probability that no miner finds a block within 30 minutes is: `0.0497 = e^(-(1/600) * 3*600)`. That is, ~5% of the time a block is found it is found after 30 minutes. This should occur multiple times a day.\r\n\r\nAn attack to exploit this proposed behavior without mining power:\r\n====\r\n\r\nAssume an attacker that can get blocks faster than the rest of the p2p network, say by connecting directly to miners and relaying blocks without verifying all the transactions:\r\n\r\n1. Attacker has many nodes in different /16s.\r\n2. Attacker floods new table with attacker IP addresses.\r\n3. Each time a victim node makes a feeler connection to an attacker node *AND* the tip is stale *AND* a new block has just been announced the attacker has a chance to replace an outgoing connection.\r\n\r\nLet's say a node makes a feeler connection and waits 90 seconds for a header reply (not sure what the actual time limit is). The probability that a block is announced in that 90 second period is: `~0.36 = 1- e^(-(1/600) * 3*90)`. Thus, conditioned on a feeler connection being made to an attacker node AND the tip being stale, the probability that a block is announced allowing an attacker to take over an outgoing connection is 36%.\r\n\r\nThis attack doesn't require restarts. A well connected attacker could just perform this attack against the entire network slowly getting more outgoing connections until it manages to fully eclipse a node. Attacker nodes would never be replaced as outgoing connections by non-attacker nodes because attacker nodes would always get the blocks first. \r\n\r\nOne positive factor is that while this many make eclipsing easier, it makes an eclipse position harder to exploit because once an attacker begins using their eclipse position to filter the view of a victim node, then the attacker is in danger of being replaced as an outgoing connection due to stale tips. Unfortunately this doesn't help much with eclipse attacks on lightning network participants because the attacker could give the victim node an unfiltered view of the Bitcoin's blockchain but just not rebroadcast breach remedy transactions.",
