It seems wasteful to return all addresses and have to search through them everytime. Currently the closest thing to this would be assigning an account to every address generated which would be a huge mess.\n\nThe following would be the new parameters.\n\n<pre><code>listunspent [minconf=1] [maxconf=999999] [bitcoinaddress]\n</code></pre>\n",
