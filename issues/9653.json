    "body": "In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8455#issuecomment-276054487 the versioning of Bitcoin Core was mentioned, but deemed off-topic, so I am creating this issue to address the fact that Bitcoin Core uses a non-traditional scheme for version releases.\r\n\r\nTo me, the first (traditionally \"major\") version number is `0` for as long as a product is considered non-production-ready, and `>0` for production-ready, and bears significant meaning in this sense.\r\n\r\nPossible mind-sets:\r\n\r\n1. It is agreed that Bitcoin Core is past beta stage, even if blockchains and crypto-currencies are new technologies. The initial `0.` is dropped, meaning that the next version is `14.0` not `0.14.0`.\r\n2. A set of milestones leading up to a 'production ready' version of Bitcoin Core are established, and this is referred to as the `1.0` release.\r\n3. This discussion is irrelevant.\r\n",

      "body": "@Leviathn, I doubt we can ever agree on when to name the version 1.0.0\ninstead of 0.XX.XX. Right now Bitcoin Core is doing a rolling release\nabout every 6 months (and minor releases whenever applicable). The\nversion number pretty much only tells in what order the releases were\nmade.\n\nThe difficulty to decide when to tag it version 1.0.0 arises when you\nrealize that Bitcoin Core is pretty much a massive bundle of different\nmodules (c.f. the folders in /src or the slide at\nhttps://youtu.be/8BLWUUPfh2Q?t=2h46m19s). And even if you could decide\nfor a single of those modules that it reached version 1.0.0, we can\njust put \"Bitcoin Core 21.0.0 comes bundled with a stable release of\nCore Wallet 1.0.0\" in the release notes, even though other parts of\nthe software may be less mature than most stable part at that time.\n\nLets jut get rid of the idea that a semi-arbitrary number that happens\nto denote the version of a Bitcoin Core release implies that the\nmaturity of the software or even of the whole Bitcoin network is\nreached. Otherwise, when version 1.0.0 means \"stable\", does 2.0.0 mean\n\"more stable\"? If so, we can just use 15.0 and 16.0 and say \"a larger\nnumber implies that the sofware is (slightly) more stable\". In this\ncontext, Matts proposal to use the number of commits makes most sense,\nbut I think sticking with the existing process and just increment the\nnumber every release is easier to handle.\n\nI think dropping the 0 prefix is the easiest way to get rid of the\nregular discussion to bump to 1.0.0.\n",

Version numbers are pretty important for users!\r\n\r\nI think that overall an acceptable \"compromise\" would be to jump versions by a few and release 0.14 as Bitcoin 17 to mean Bitcoin 2017. If there are multiple releases intended in a given year, then it should be marked as YY.MM, eg 17.02 for a release in February 2017. This is how Ubuntu does it IIRC, and it works pretty well I think (we'd never really do 2 versions in a month...). A downside is that if, for some reason, there is no release for a year you skip a version number! Any releases can be handled as a counter at the end, e.g., 17.02.011, 17.02.012.\r\n\r\n",

We have a strictly time-based release process: a major release every 6 months, minor releases as necessary. Every major release, the second number is increased. This is completely predictable and requires zero discussion, which makes it very efficient.\r\n\r\nAs there are always two major releases per year,  this also means that @JeremyRubin's idea to go to purely year-month based version numbers isn't that crazy. For major releases, minor releases would still get a `.x` as they are fixups to older releases. This is the same for Ubuntu: `Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (Trusty Tahr)`. First number is the year, second the month of that (major) release, third number is the update (\"point-release\").",

This would change the Schedule for 0.16 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11449 to be releasing version 18.5.1.\r\n\r\nIf we also want to do something like Ubuntu with having adj+animal releases, maybe something like 'Bumpy Barnacle' or 'Boisterous Beagle'.\r\n\r\n",

Having said that, I see your point and mostly agree. After thinking more about it, I think the bigger issue would be not the user confusion, but occasional accidental confusion during discussions when mentioning the version names in the context of similar concepts and terminology being discussed. I guess I'd be happy with Alice Core, Bob Core, Carol Core, ... the Core family.",

No software is ever finished, but the procedures this project is following (testing, compatibility across versions, release schedule, ...) certainly already follow an expectation of stable interfaces and operation. I believe that is a better criterion anyway than a vague \"ready for mainstream use\" (certainly our software's versioning shouldn't depend on its audience or on the currency's adoption).\n\nAs a result, I think the 0 is just redundant. Of the various ways to proceed I think shifting up the digits has the least risk of incorrectly being interpreted as a major event instead of just recognizing that the zero serves no purpose.\n\n",

If we ever have a hard fork, it'll be important that everyone is running a compatible client.  To some extent it doesn't matter now whether you are running 0.11 or 0.16.

      "body": "> I'm pretty strongly in favor of the HARDFORK.MAJOR.MINOR versioning scheme mentioned here: #12026 (comment)\r\n\r\n> Did I miss some discussion as to why people are opposed to this?\r\n> This would put the versioning scheme to very good use in conveying important information. If we ever have a hard fork, it'll be important that everyone is running a compatible client. To some extent it doesn't matter now whether you are running 0.11 or 0.16. But after a hard fork, it'll matter that everyone is running 1.something.\r\n\r\nI agree that a version that implements a hard forking change should prominently convey this information. However, I highly disagree that a hard fork should be accompanied by a version *bump*. That falsely also conveys (to some) that a hard fork is always better that a previous version that does not implement the hard fork. (The version number is larger, so it must be better, ...)\r\n\r\nAlso, bumping the version number in case of a hard fork implementation does not work very well with backports. Assume a hard fork in version 0.x is backported to version 0.(x-1), you can't really bump *both* to the same 1.0.0 version...\r\n\r\nI see two ways to convey that a software version implements a hard fork:\r\n* Mention it in the software name or other prominent place. E.g. instead of \"Bitcoin Core\" it is \"Bitcoin Core ${FEATURE}\"\r\n* Use a field in the version number to *indicate* that a hard fork was implemented. So the first hard fork gets the number \"1\", which is also backported along with the hard fork code changes to previous versions. E.g. a hard fork can be backported to version x and x-1, becoming 1.x and 1.(x-1), respectively. Though, that again comes with the downside of assigning numbers to hard forks, where a higher number is often interpreted as \"better\".",

      "body": "> However, I highly disagree that a hard fork should be accompanied by a version bump. That falsely also conveys (to some) that a hard fork is always better that a previous version that does not implement the hard fork. (The version number is larger, so it must be better, ...)\r\n\r\nA hard fork _should_ be better than a previous version that does not implement the hard fork. Otherwise, why bother to do the release at all? Also, there are plenty of examples of software where larger version numbers are not better than older versions (at least in the opinion of some users). It's why sites like [Old Version](http://www.oldversion.com) exist. So I don't think this particular aspect is a downside.",
