Maybe we could have an option that exports only public keys/only private keys/both.\n\nI guess the big picture of the general use cases for such a features needs a little more thought.\n",

      "body": "@nanotube take the example of bitcoin-central, one thing that would be great would be that the internet accessible client can generate addresses at will, only have knowledge of the pubkeys so it can track incoming transfers, and have an offline client which also has the private keys in order to be able to sign transactions.\n\nThis would require a two way interaction : \n- When the internet client runs low on addresses you can feed it a bunch of public keys generated on the private client\n- Manually feed the blockchain to the private client\n\nSo at any time the public client has a pool of 10 to 100k public keys for which the private client knows the private keys, and whenever you want to sign transactions you feed some blocks to the private client, create a tx, and feed it to the public client for broadcast. Hopefully I'm clear and making sense :)\n\nI think that would be an awesome level of security.\n",

      "body": "Er, hey.  It's not desirable to have the blockchain on the airgapped wallet— god forbid someone figure out how to trigger a bug in its blockchain parsing.   ... More importantly your airgapped wallet might be a dumb smart card.\n\nInstead the normal client should maintain your balances, create the transaction... but when it goes to sign it it will find out it doesn't have the private key.   So it creates a signing request, which you shuttle over to the secure wallet (somehow). The secure wallet asks you to approve the transactions— showing you the outputs and values (perhaps supporting batches), then signs them all, and you shuttle them back over to the main client for injection into the network.\n\nAlso— I described how to solve the running out of addresses problem here: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=19137.0  (the type-2 proposal)\n",

      "body": "Step 1.  Trojan on user's computer.  (duh, this is what we're fighting against so its a given).\nStep 2.  Create corrupted block data for airgap computer sync.\nStep 3.  Airgap computer compromised, copies private key data into the signature fields instead of signing.\nStep 4.  User dutifully carries data back to the computer where the trojan then runs off with the keys.\n\nFar out? A bit— but it's reduced to nothing not giving the airgap computer more non-trivial data than is required, which is just sound practice.  The block chain is a complicated data-structure which has has triggered vulnerabilities before.  I think of it this way: If someone did pull off this attack, would many people say (in retrospect) that it was obvious and your fault for not avoiding it?  I think so. :)\n\nAlso, lfm pointed out to me that you need to know the input transactions too— otherwise you might be sending lots of money away in fees if your system was compromised. But they can simply be packed up with the data to be signed. The secure wallet only needs to parse them for their output values an verify their hashes.\n",
