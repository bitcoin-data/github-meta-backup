    "title": "Block notifications not working with invalidateblock",
    "body": "<!--- Remove sections that do not apply -->\n### Describe the issue\n\nThe notification callbacks for new blocks / changes to the tip are not invoked when using `invalidateblock`.  This leads, among other things, to the issue with the new `waitfornewblock` RPC and, consequently, to failures in regression tests using `sync_blocks` and `invalidateblock` to trigger reorgs.  (I'm not sure if that involves any of the official regression tests, but it can be observed with custom tests.)\n\nThis seems to be strongly related to #5806.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the problem is that `InvalidateBlock` (as called from the `invalidateblock` RPC handler) already changes `chainActive.Tip()`, and then `ActivateBestChain` (which is supposed to trigger the notifications and other updates) returns early as the most work block is already the chain tip.\n\nI'd like to fix the issue, but do not feel confident enough with the involved code to decide how to best do it.  I see two straight-forward solutions, which both have their pros and cons - I'd be grateful for any insights into which one (if any of them) is the correct:\n1. Trigger the notifications and updates from `ActivateBestChain` even if the most work block is already the chain tip.  This seems clean and straight-forward, but I'm not sure if `ActivateBestChain` might be called even without any changes done to the chain, in which case it would yield spurious notification calls.  Is this possible?\n2. `InvalidateBlock` is only called from the `invalidateblock` RPC and is a somewhat special situation.  We could manually trigger the same notifications as `ActivateBestChain` does from there.  This requires to either duplicate the notification and update code or factor it out into a new function, and feels less clean.\n### Is the issue reproducible?\n#### List steps to reproduce below:\n1. Run a regtest mode daemon.\n2. Call `waitfornewblock`.\n3. Call `invalidateblock` on the currently best block.\n### Expected behavior\n\n`waitfornewblock` should return with the new best block (i. e., the block that was previously the one just before the tip).\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe change to the chain tip is not noticed and `waitfornewblock` keeps on waiting.\n",
