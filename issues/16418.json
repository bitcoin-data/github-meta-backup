    "title": "Ensure we have sufficient transaction-relay peers",
    "body": "Currently, we have no protections in place if our outbound peers are running in `-blocksonly` mode.  In practice, we rely on our outbound peers to be our best source of announced transactions, but if all our outbound peers were `-blocksonly`, we would make no effort to disconnect any to find an alternative peer to receive transactions from.\r\n\r\nWe discover at connection time (in the VERSION message) whether our peer will relay transactions on our link.  Perhaps we should tolerate some number of `-blocksonly` peers as outbounds, and once we hit that threshold we should disconnect new blocksonly outbounds?\r\n\r\nI suppose another issue could be if it's worth having logic that tries to determine whether a peer is silently withholding transactions from us...  We have logic for blocks, where we try to find a new outbound peer if we haven't received a new block in a while, but I don't know if there's a reasonable way to do this for transactions.  My guess is that this is not a very pressing concern, but perhaps we could do something that just tried making new outbound connections if we aren't receiving any transactions at all?",

If we preference blocks-only peers for our blocks-only outbounds, then unless there are a lot of similarly diverse blocks-only peers out there, we will reduce our peer diversity substantially.  \r\n\r\nFrom an accounting perspective, perhaps there could be a way for us to \"downgrade\" a link that we expect to be a transaction-relay-peer that turns out to be a blocks-only peer, but I don't know if it will be worth the trouble of implementing something like that, and it's not totally clear to me whether that would introduce a bias that would be concerning.  I think it's easiest to reason about pulling a candidate peer out of our addrman at random, connecting, and staying connected as long as it offers the services we expect.  In the case of the issue I brought up here, I'd say that we should allow up to 2 or 3 of our outbounds being blocks-only (when we expect them to be tx-relay peers) and then if we encounter further blocks-only outbounds, we disconnect.  Anyway, this can all be discussed in any PRs that try to fix this.",
