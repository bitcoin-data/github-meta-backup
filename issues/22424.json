    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\n- Unable to spend unconfirmed UTXO\r\n- OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES = 100\r\n\r\nThe combination of these two things affects privacy which is discussed in detail here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22018\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/125175429-a7932500-e1e9-11eb-99f0-60fd382ec84b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are already marking used addresses as 'grey' in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17355. Can improve this by marking 'red' for addresses used twice or more for receiving bitcoin. Grey color for addresses used once. Once we have dirty coins (received bitcoin twice or more), they should be locked automatically, dump private keys associated with the addresses and import them in a new wallet (sub-wallet for dirty coins).\r\n\r\nNot sure if there should be a sub wallet for each address or all dirty coins go in one sub wallet.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUse other wallets\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis will improve following things:\r\n\r\n1. No wallet fingerprinting\r\n2. Keep things separate\r\n3. Manage [forced address reuse](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Forced_address_reuse) in a better way\r\n4. Neither UTXOs being confirmed nor value for `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` will matter anymore. The user can decide how to spend dirty coins in future. Either use all in one transaction or do coinjoin or something else.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking for Concept ACKs and discussion about this solution so that implementation can be planned if enough people agree to add this feature.\r\n\r\nThanks @harding for suggesting idea about sub-wallets in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22018#issuecomment-850803134",

Hence with subwallets a payment would fail if it needed dirty UTXOs to get up to the payment amount.\r\n\r\nThis does create some challenges (code and UX) as at the very least the user would want to be informed that they have enough funds to make the payment across the original wallet and the sub wallet. And I would guess the user would want the option to go ahead with the payment despite it spending dirty UTXOs. Hence you would need to introduce some logic across the subwallet and the original wallet which leads to the question why were they separated in the first place?\r\n\r\n",
