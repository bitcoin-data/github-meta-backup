    "title": "RFC: Replacing Boost Process",
    "body": "Boost Process is currently relatively poorly maintained; bugs are remaining unfixed for multiple Boost releases, the code and issue tracking is [confusingly](https://github.com/boostorg/process/pull/243) spread across multiple repositories, see https://github.com/boostorg/process/ and https://github.com/klemens-morgenstern/boost-process), which themselves each have different versions of the code.\r\n\r\nThere's been no recent \"modernization\" of the module, i.e an option use `std::filesystem` over `boost::filesystem`, like other Boost modules, which is why we no-longer support external signing on Windows, see #24065. \r\n\r\nIt's inclusion in our project is also a downside to our Boost consolidation / removal, i.e #24742, as Process's own dependencies (filesystem, system, win-api, + others) pull in even more Boost modules (i.e asio), which in turn pull in further modules..\r\n\r\nIf we are going to continue to use/expand our usage of it, I think we need some sort of plan, addressing the above, rather than leaving it ignored while we start accumulating workarounds, i.e #24523, in our own code to support it, and it's presence potentially blocks other project goals.\r\n\r\nOne potential alternative is https://github.com/arun11299/cpp-subprocess.",

So one alternative to look at could be [QT process](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qprocess.html). That said, the RPC code also serves to maintain good test coverage, and we wouldn't want to pull a QT dependency into bitcoind.

      "body": "FWIW, I started working on replacing boost::process with cpp-subprocess on the following branch: https://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/tree/nuke_boost_process\r\nCurrently the unit tests (system_tests/run_command) and functional tests (rpc_signer.py, wallet_signer.py) pass on both Linux and OpenBSD, but compiling for Windows via g++-mingw-w64-x86-64-posix fails due to missing headers (`Windows.h`). The changes are not very invasive, most work was probably to change from passing a single string to a list of arguments.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is motivated to continue the work or maybe just want to evaluate if cpp-subprocess is a proper replacement candidate, feel free to take the commits. I'm currently not running any Windows system where I could even test the changes, the best I can do is to cross-compile (which as said above, doesn't even work yet) and run the unit tests via Wine. cpp-subprocess' README.md says:\r\n> Support for Windows is limited at this time. Please report any specific use-cases that fail, and they will be fixed as they are reported.\r\n\r\nso there are likely more changes needed to make everything work as expected.",
