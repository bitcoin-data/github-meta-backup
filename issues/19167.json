      "body": "I wanted to sync a full, non-pruned node on to an Apple Time Capsule storage drive. Thought solving this issue might be useful for others as well. But I hit a wall. Here are my notes in case it's useful for the next person who gets interested in this issue:\r\n\r\n- bitcoind creates a .lock file on datadir\r\n- This is done using the `fcntl` sys call\r\n- Sidenote: Filesystem locks in unix are advisory only. They only really protected against other instances of well-behaved applications. Advisory file locks are made by the OS keeping track of a pid that currently holds the lock. This is more involved over NAS storage because the lock-holding process can be on other network computers as well.\r\n- Apple Time Capsule uses AFP(Apple Filing Protocol) over TCP and `fcntl` does not seem to work as expected.\r\n- Changing the code to use the `is_wsl` workaround in `src/fs.cpp FileLock::TryLock` for AFP allows bitcoind to capture the lock using the `flock` syscall instead of `fcntl`. However, then it seems that the lock is simply ignored by another well-behaved bitcoind process.\r\n- Further down the execution path, leveldb is unable to acquire locks as well. This is likely also because of a similar issue but changing leveldb is likely more involved in time.\r\n- I decided to give up on this approach to run a full node.",
