If Bitcoin replaces gold, and becomes $500,000 per Bitcoin, then it's reasonable to assume the consumption will be 1200 TWh, which would be more than the usage of India (the 3rd biggest user of electricity worldwide).\r\n\r\nElectrum, the 2nd biggest market cap in crypto is aiming to move to Proof of Stake. Does Bitcoin have any plans to address this ethical issue?",
