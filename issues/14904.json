Because I still remember the old days waiting for the node to sync when I was still a outright noob (then I'm proud to be an experienced noob now). At that time I also worried about whether my precious non-SMR (CMR) HDD would break after putting such a such a crazy intensive I/O burden on it - as we all know, HDD vendors are shameless enough to silently push unlabeled DM-SMR drives to the consumer market.",
