    "title": "Improving UTXO privacy through burning small UTXOs",
    "body": "As is known, maintaining privacy on Bitcoin is an ongoing challenge, and one way this could be improved in the Core wallet is by providing a command that uses a standardized transaction template to burn a UTXO.\r\n\r\nWhile you can manually burn a UTXO today, say by making a single-input transaction that only contains an OP_RETURN, actually creating such an OP_RETURN transaction with the Core wallet is a bit complicated and somewhat risky, as it would only be limited by -maxtxfee. Additionally, fingerprinting of whatever data you put in OP_RETURN as well as the rarity of such transactions hurt privacy as well.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to add a command with similar arguments to `lockunspent`, so something like;\r\n\r\n`burnunspent \"[{\\\"txid\\\":\\\"mytxid\\\",\\\"vout\\\":myvout}]\"`\r\n\r\nwhich would create a single-input transaction of the provided UTXO, with an OP_RETURN with sufficient bytes of random data to make it relayable (preferably indistinguishable from some common hashing algorithm), and return this as a hex-encoded transaction that you would then have to send with `sendrawtransaction`. This would be safer than broadcasting it directly, and allows you to broadcast the transaction through another channel for additional privacy. You would also want some safeguards against burning a large UTXO, which could be done with a (possibly configurable) burn limit.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it would be equivalent to `createrawtransaction \"[{\\\"txid\\\":\\\"mytxid\\\",\\\"vout\\\":myvout}]\" \"[{\\\"data\\\":\\\"myrandomhexbytes\\\"}]\"` + `signrawtransactionwithwallet`, with some built-in safeguards.\r\n\r\nFrom a blockchain health perspective, an empty OP_RETURN would be preferable, but this violates the `tx-size-small` limit (see #18296) and cannot be relayed with today's relaying policy. Would it be technically feasible/desirable to exempt such a specific template from this policy without opening up vectors for exploiting the merkle leaf-node weakness?",

I tested a couple of transactions with empty OP_RETURN (that is, assuming that the template could be exempted for the relaying policy), and the numbers I got from `decoderawtransaction` was:\r\n\r\n1 native segwit UTXO: size=171, vsize=89, weight=354\r\n2 native segwit UTXOs: size=319, vsize=157, weight=625\r\n\r\nSo each UTXO would add ~148 bytes or ~271 weight, meaning the overhead of burning/donating/whatever the UTXOs individually would be ~23 bytes or ~83 weight per UTXO - unless there's something wrong with my math or TX serialization understanding, of course.",
