This only occurs if the last action preformed on the window was an Areo snap. If the last action was just a traditional move, it restores to the last location. If the last action was an Areo snap, it restores to the location before the Areo snap.\n\nI'm guessing that Bitcoin could work around this, but it probably wouldn't be worth it.\n",
