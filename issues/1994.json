    "title": "Log shutdown signals",
    "body": "bitcoind should write to debug.log when it receives a shutdown signal so operator knows signal was sent while debugging/setup and for general logging.\n#### Story\n\nAs a new bitcoind operator, it was not evident to me why bitcoind was running so slow. This manifested in several ways:\n- RPC calls from localhost took 1-2 mins\n- uptime went through the roof\n- shutdown also took 1-2 mins\n\nI have since realized the obvious (now that I understand bitcoin better) that I'm still verifying my own block chain. _(This is taking freaking forever! I know I could use a lightweight...)_\n#### Rational\n\nWhat I've proposed is a simple change that would significantly help new users and ensure proper logging of significant events.\n\nIf debug.log had printed a trivial message that it had started it's shutdown process, I wouldn't have been pulling my hair out trying to figure out why killing it was doing nothing. _(I was watching tail -f debug.log)_\n###### Related note\n\nAdding to debug.log that the local blockchain is behind by more than ~2 blocks and that some time may be required to catch up would also be very useful, especially for people unfamiliar with bitcoin[d].\n",
