    "title": "Using Bitcoin Core on a Mac mini + QNAP NAS Error",
    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI would like some help, please.\r\nI decided to run a full bitcoin node. I have a Mac mini server with Catalina 10.15.5 and a QNAP NAS (AFP) with 80TB as well as a very fast line.\r\n\r\nI installed Bitcoin Core on the Mac Mini and experiencing a few issues.\r\n\r\n1 - Why this application is not signed with an Apple certificate? Apple does not recognize it properly. I think it would be beneficial if it did. However, it can still be run by bypassing the security layer of Apple.\r\n\r\n2 - When I launch it the first time it asks me to select a directory. This directory also will host the 300gigs for the block, so I created a BTC volume on the NAS (don't have that space available on the Mac mini) so I can save the ledger in its own dedicated space and it's here that I experience issues.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I select the directory I get a dialog error.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"410\" alt=\"85956961-291e6900-b981-11ea-9dbe-bf0d2ff45602\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63108238/86007166-f28f2f80-ba0e-11ea-9016-251c462571dd.png\">\r\n\r\nError: Cannot obtain a lock on data directory /Volumes/BTC/Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core is probably already running.\r\n\r\nThe folder \"blocks\" gets created but also is unable to proceed and will quit the application once acknowledged and will no start again anymore unless I delete it.\r\n\r\nIs it even possible to run the app and have the block saved on an external AFP volume?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n\r\n",
