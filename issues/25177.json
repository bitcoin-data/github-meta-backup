    "title": "General discussion on review process, impact on consensus compatible forks, noisy comments",
    "body": "There are a few broader issues being bundled into the discussion on the now merged PR #25153 which are leading to some noise and what I consider some inappropriate and uninformed Approach NACKs. I do think these issues warrant further discussion but they are not specific to that particular PR.\r\n\r\n> If by more work, you mean, it might make it more difficult for you to maintain Knots, which maintains build options and code that we have removed, then yes, that's possible. However Bitcoin Core isn't making engineering/maintainence decisions based on whether or not they are benficial for forks of this codebase.\r\n\r\nI do think Core should factor in the impact of changes to consensus compatible forks such as Knots. It is only one factor of many but I don't see consensus compatible forks as an irrelevance (especially in the light of motivations of Core subprojects like libbitcoinkernel). Long term I consider consensus compatible forks as an escape latch if a group of maintainers/contributors were ever to go rogue and start merging in things to Core with malicious intentions. To be clear I don't think this is happening here nor do I think this will happen anytime soon but I would be very uncomfortable with a future where it became increasingly difficult to maintain a consensus compatible fork of Core.\r\n\r\n> Its not necessary to follow the history and sometimes common sense is enough to review a pull request. Particularly after reading such tweet from a respected core developer: https://nitter.net/LukeDashjr/status/1527427645025136641\r\n\r\nThere are billions of people who can write \"Approach NACK\" and then parrot what Luke has said without any understanding of the context of prior Core PRs or the challenges of maintaining a consensus compatible fork of Core. This is noise. Hence for future conversations on broader issues that aren't specific to a PR I'd ask you to discuss it on IRC, open an issue etc rather than adding noise to the review of a PR with an uninformed Approach NACK. The review process doesn't work if we start getting billions of parrot NACKs and they somehow have to be factored into the merge decision.\r\n\r\n> I think it's overall an improvement to method naming. But I do agree this got merged way too quickly, especially for something that impacts 32 files.\r\n\r\nI agree. When there is a technically informed NACK from a maintainer of a consensus compatible fork (and long term contributor to Core) I think at the very least more long term contributors (ideally with contextual understanding of previous PRs) should look at it before it is merged. Ignoring that NACK and merging with a single ACK within 3 days of the PR being opened does not seem like a solid review process to me.\r\n",

If we decide against that, then it shouldn't be reverted obviously.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't care if 25153 is reverted or not, but I think this whole discussion might be a bit exaggerated. 25153 is a scripted-diff that will run in a few milliseconds. It should take less than 2 minutes for any forked repos to write an inverse scripted-diff which can be executed in the same few milliseconds on any branch they wish to execute it on.",
