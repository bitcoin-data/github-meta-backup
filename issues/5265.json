    "title": "Why not use Bitcoin 0.10 to hard fork ?",
    "body": "I'm simply an advanced user who speaks for the scalability hard fork.\n\nSo, I am sure you know the psychological difference between a 0.10 version and 0.9 version.\nThey can be seen as 0.1 and 0.0.9 versions by users.\n\nAnd only a 0.20 (0.2) version can reproduce this effect.\n\nThe problem is the time that separates these two versions:\n- If it is too short, version 0.20 will be less quickly adapted by users than 0.10 version.\n- If it is too long (6 months or more), the hard fork can be an emergency measure.\n\nFrom this fact, and allowing users to update within 3 months, why not hard fork with 0.10 ?\n\nAs an example, we can note the hard fork of Dogecoin (1.8):\n\nDogecoin has 4 times less nodes than Bitcoin, but within 3 weeks, more than 50% of nodes have update, without the media exposure of Bitcoin.\n\n3 months for update, it seems very correct.\n\nWhat's the plan for it?\n",

The system has the rules that people accepted and have invested in for years now. You can't just change those from under them. In case there is no overwhelming consensus that a particular change is needed, you just can't make it. The inter-block time is certainly one of those things that would be very controversial to change.\n\nIf you're actually interested in proposing such changes, please do so on the mailing list.

Sidechains would allow using bitcoins in fancy experiments without hardforks. Of course, innovation doesn't stop, it just means that bitcoin can pick and choose what turns out to be a good idea from other projects.\n\nThere is no hurry here. It is easy to call fears disproportionate from the sidelines, but a critical problem in bitcoin is likely to make people lose trust in the entire crypto-currency ecosystem for a long time.\n",
