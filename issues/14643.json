    "body": "sorry, I tried asking elsewhere and got zero response so I'm coming here... how should I be checking my bitcoind for received payments on my website? right now I do this from node.js:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrpc.call('getreceivedbyaddress', [ address, 0 ], (error, result) => {\r\n// do stuff with result\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhow long should this take to alert me to a payment with 0 confirmations? is there a better/more efficient way to check for a transaction to an address in my wallet? I'm using Bech32 addresses. I've read the developer documentation about 5 times and this is the best I could come up with.... thank you!",
