There are multiple options:\r\n   - Don't ever allow v1 and v2 txs below minrelaytxfee (#26933)\r\n   - Mine everything that makes it into in the mempool (default blockmintxfee to 0). Trim descendant packages <=0 fees, even when the mempool is not full (#27018)\r\n   - Other long-term improvements that address this problem, e.g. #27677.\r\n- [ ] Properly assess incentive compatibility, submit transactions with their in-package ancestor sets (#26711)\r\n- (Some existing DoS and incentive compatibility issues are addressed. It is safe to expose this interface on P2P)\r\n- [ ] Handle any arbitrary package, even if unsorted. Relax from child-with-parents to tx-with-ancestors (#26711)\r\n- [ ] Add v3 rules that make transactions/packages easier to work with (#25038)\r\n- [ ] Introduce a Miner Incentive Compatibility Score rule to RBF\r\n  - This is done for v3 transactions in #25038.\r\n  - Cluster-based mempool would allow this for all transactions: #27677.\r\n- [ ] Enable Package RBF for v3 transactions (#25038)\r\n- (Things like LN can sign things 0-fee, add fees at broadcast, and avoid pinning attacks. Assuming package relay is available.)\r\n- [ ] Add Ephemeral Anchors rules for v3 transactions (#26403)\r\n- (LN symmetry and other things can have 0-value anchors.)\r\n- [ ] When loading mempool, keep transactions that are below minimum feerate(s) but are CPFP'd. (#27476 or other)\r\n\r\n**P2P, Net Processing**\r\nFull implementation: #27742\r\n- [ ] BIP 331 (bitcoin/bips/pull/1382)\r\n- [ ] (Milestone 1/3) Modularize and improve orphan-handling. Use all announcers of the orphan as potential orphan resolution candidates, and introduce a mechanism for load-balancing between peers and preferring some peers over others.\r\n- (Orphan-handling is more robust)\r\n- [ ] (Milestone 2/3) Negotiate package relay support with peers, gated by config flag (`sendpackages`). Request ancestor package information for orphans (`MSG_ANCPKGINFO`, `ancpkginfo`).\r\n- (Assuming adoption, in most cases, package relay nodes never need to use txid-based relay)\r\n- [ ] (Milestone 3/3) Using package info, request (`getpkgtxns`), download (`pkgtxns`), and submit packages together.\r\n  - [ ] Introduce a mechanism for protecting orphan transactions from eviction.\r\n  - [ ] Avoid telling legacy peers about transactions that depend on below-fee-filter parents.\r\n- [ ] Default `-packagerelay` config flag to true.\r\n- (Assuming adoption, below-mempool min feerate CPFP'd transactions propagate.)",

      "body": "I think one more sub-category to track is the feedback collected on how package relay/nversion=3 are fitting multi-party applications and contracting protocols\r\n- Lightning: legacy channels / anchor output / taproot types\r\n- Peerswap: claim with preimage + refund cooperatively + refund after csv passes\r\n- Collaborative transaction: splicing + dual funding flows\r\n\r\nThe [0-conf flow](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/910) of Lightning can be also considered. As deployed today by some LSPs where both incoming/outgoing HTLCs are allowed during the pending confirmation period, there is a risk in case of mempool congestions of the inbound funding transaction not confirming before the timelock of the offered HTLC output expires. The current nversion=3 size is 1000 vb which might be too low if LSPs would like to do batching of 0-confs. Note, I think all the pinning risks are not the same for 0-conf funding transactions than for time-sensitive confirmation of LN commitment+HTLCs transactions.\r\n\r\nMentioning 0-conf, and as raised on [#27643](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26525#issuecomment-1473067644) at some point in the development cycle of nversion=3 it might be good communication practice to publish than all 0confs users might have to upgrade their mempool monitoring stuff to reject nversion=3, or chain of transactions with them, as otherwise genuine upgrade to the version of Core with package relay might lower their security.\r\n\r\nFor Lightning, there is the question if the p2p package format is flexible enough for the Lightning channels to apply \"new mempool rules\" on \"old in-flight channnel type\". Like backward compatible effect of the mempools rules without off-chain channels having to cooperate on-resigning transactions. I believe that would require a Lightning node to sign the p2p package with the same pubkey than used with the channel (though I start to think we might have multiple types of backward/forward compatible application of mempools rules like the ones mentioned in [#25038](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#issuecomment-1405944407), like there is some matrix ?)\r\n\r\nFor the second-layers listed, I'm just considering the ones which have a) a mature specification and b) some substantial deployment though should we consider more second-layers or multi-party applications like vaults (non-deployed) ?\r\n\r\nFrom a reviewer viewpoint, I think it could be very valuable if you can highlight the 2/3 PRs or mail posts you consider as top of the stack for reviews ? Thanks for a package-relay context-tracking meta-issue.\r\n\r\n(Feel free to integrate what you find relevant of this comment to ease context tracking of package relay as a project)",
