    "title": "Wallet rescan progress indicator not intuitive",
    "body": "### Issue\r\n\r\nWallet rescan progress indicator in debug.log is not intuitive. For example, 0.953423 doesn't mean 95% done.\r\nThis isn't a big issue for me, but I want to report it because it may save the next person some time (unnecessary wait).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. Import privkey with rescan \r\n2. Tail the log\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI would expect that  `Progress=0.980699` means I'm 98% done.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nOn testnet (obviously) I'm 0.98 complete (is that 98% complete?) rescanning block 576517, whereas currently ` height=1032846` or so.\r\n`2016-11-11 20:50:02 Still rescanning. At block 576517. Progress=0.980699`\r\nIt's not done yet (2+ hours now), but I hope progress won't end up being greater than 1, because that would be even more confusing.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.12.1 with addrindex patch ([source](https://github.com/btcdrak/bitcoin/releases/tag/v0.12.1-addrindex))\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- CPU:  ARMv8\r\n- RAM: 1GB\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD): SSD\r\n\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\nHere's couple of sections from my debug.log. At block 53K it's already 0.17 done (wonderful) so instead of killing the daemon and retrying with no rescan, I decide to wait. Encouraged by the fast progress I keep waiting... and waiting. If I knew 0.17 doesn't really mean \"17% done\" I would have saved myself few hours of wait.\r\n```\r\n2016-11-11 19:24:49 Still rescanning. At block 53404.

      "body": ":) @jonasschnelli actually, the progress shows as less than it really is, so it shouldn't be causing unneccessary wait. i.e. if the last block downloaded is 0.989920 progress, then the rescan will finish at 0.989920, i.e. you won't need to wait for it to get to 1.000000.\n\nThe risk of the number being misleading is that you'll go away to make a sandwich thinking it is going to take longer than it does need, and will come back later than need be.\n\nVery easy to fix, we just need to tweak the number to factor in that the 0.989920 (or whatever the progress of the last downloaded block is) is actually 1.000000, and that the number of the first block to rescan is 0.000000.\n",

      "body": "No, the progress indicator does not show less and there is no download involved. I's about rescan.\nThe testnet blockchain has over 1 million blocks and 53,000 (the beginning of my log sample above) isn't 17% of that and 632,818 (the end of my sample) isn't 98.9% of that.  (Assuming 0.xy means xy %.)\n\nAnd no, it does cause extra wait because if it took me 3 minutes to get to 38%, it should take me less than 9 minutes to complete rescan. If I can tell online rescan is expected to take hours, I can stop bitcoind, rescan, start bitcoind again and likely save 50% of the total time required for online rescan. That doesn't have practical downside compared to online scan because during online rescan bitcoind can't do anything anyway.\n\nIn any case, either a clarification (docs) of what the progress bar indicates or a change in the code would make it easier for users to make informed decisions.\n",

If the time to scan a block is related to its size, then the % calculation just needs to take into account the size of data so far known, and the size so far scanned to come up with a more accurate percentage.
