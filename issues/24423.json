    "title": "Add `not_null<T>` from the Guidelines Support Library",
    "body": "There are many places in the codebase where we use a pointer type (`*`, `shared_ptr`, `unique_ptr`, etc.) because of historical reasons (`CBlockIndex*`) or for polymorphism. In many such cases, we may want to avoid needing to handle the pointer being null, or make it clear in the function contract that we require a non-null pointer.\r\n\r\n`not_null<T>` is the solution proposed by the C++ Core Guidelines ([relevant section](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rf-nullptr)), and restricts pointers and smart pointers to hold non-null values.\r\n\r\nSince I've learned about this, I've repeatedly ran into scenarios where I wish I could use it so as to make call semantics clearer and avoid misuse / unnecessary null handling.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere is a header-only implementation of `not_null<T>` [here](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL/blob/4377f6e603c64a86c934f1546aa9db482f2e1a4e/include/gsl/pointers#L69-L82), however, there are two issues we need to solve:\r\n\r\n1. The header-only implementation linked above requires the `Expects` and `Ensures` macros defined [here](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL/blob/4377f6e603c64a86c934f1546aa9db482f2e1a4e/include/gsl/assert#L129-L130), do we also import these or can we tweak our existing assertion macros to work?\r\n2. There is also a [`strict_not_null<T>`](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL/blob/4377f6e603c64a86c934f1546aa9db482f2e1a4e/include/gsl/pointers#L222-L238), which requires explicit construction. Do we need that or just `not_null<T>`?",

      "body": "I guess I'd be curious to see real examples of where it is useful. It seems to me like most of the places where you could use `not_null<T*>` you could use `T&` instead and references seem nicer to me aesthetically, and I like how they limit what you can do with the variable (just access the data not do mess with pointer or ownership). The only cases where `not_null` seems really useful is when when you need the pointer variable to be able change which object it is pointing to. This could be better in some data structures than raw pointers or reference_wrappers (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33306553/gslnot-nullt-vs-stdreference-wrappert-vs-t), but I don't think these cases are very common in our codebase. \r\n\r\nI think in general replacing `T&` with `not_null<T*>` would be bad, while using `not_null<T*>` in certain data structures could be good. A more neutral case could be replacing things like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconst CChain& active = Assert(m_node.chainman)->ActiveChain();\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconst CChain& active = m_node.chainman->ActiveChain();\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou get same runtime assert in either case here, but in first case author is clearly stating intention for chainman to be not null **here** at this line of the code, while in second case with `not_null` author is just saying the pointer shouldn't be null any place it is dereferenced, which isn't saying much. I could see people preferring the second version though.",
