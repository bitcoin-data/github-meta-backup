    "title": "Discussion: Potential USDTs (User Static Defined Traces) for Core ",
    "body": "USDTs are tracepoints and behave similar to trace logging (no performance impact if not used), but can pass data into scripts running in a Linux kernel VM for collection and further evaluation. The required build system changes and a tracing framework for User Static Defined Traces (USDTs) were merged in #19866 and some additional discussion took place in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20960. Simpler scripts, such as collecting and printing metrics as histogram, can be created with the [bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) tool. Complexer [bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) scripts are written in C and loaded into the kernel with, for example, the bcc Python module where the passed data can be processed.\r\n\r\nFollowing the [core-dev-meeting discussion](https://bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch/ircmeetings/logs/bitcoin-core-dev/2021/bitcoin-core-dev.2021-01-21-19.00.moin.txt) on 21st Jan 2021, the goal here is to list potentially interesting USDTs and what data they should pass. The USDT should have:\r\n1. a clear use-case and motivation\r\n2. a semi-stable API (order of arguments don't change so people can rely on these for scripting)\r\n3. no expensive operations added specifically for this USDT (no parsing, serialization, ... - just passing of already avaliable data)\r\n4. a documentation in `docs/tracing.md`\r\n5. (ideally) a usage example as bftrace or bcc script\r\n6. (need to double check this) a maximum of 512 bytes passed (max stack size in bpftrace)\r\n\r\nWhile some kind of testing of the USDT examples would be good, root privileges are required to load programs in the kernel VM. Might still be possible to run them in a CI, though?\r\n\r\n**What could be useful USDTs? What data should they pass? Where should they be placed in the code?**",

While the serialized block header would not be bigger than the stack size, header serialization would need to happen even when no USDTs are attached. This has an performance impact and should not be done.  \r\n\r\n@jb55 used an earlier version of `validation:connect_block` to measure IBD performance.  \r\n\r\nDepending on placement in `ConnectBlock()`, this could either trace to-be-connected blocks or connected blocks (no error while connecting). In either way, the documentation should make it clear for which blocks the data is passed. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7d8a10a6f4d61df1f4afb138e379149565afa02d/src/validation.cpp#L1946",

In theory you could get the same functionality as statoshi (stats gathering via prometheus) with https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter Would be an interesting project.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I agree! This would be my preferred way to do this kind of reporting, to be honest. It'd flexible and built into the operating system. It has low impact on the code and low impact on performance. It could potentially work for all software.\r\n> \r\n> One reason Statoshi never got merged is because it's just too much hassle to integrate and maintain a Bitcoin Core specific framework for this. Not because it's not a great thing to have.\r\n\r\nI have a demo for Prometheus metrics via eBPF based on the tracepoints added in #22006 in [0xB10C/bitcoind-observer](https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoind-observer). It's written in Rust and uses the [bcc](https://crates.io/crates/bcc) crate under the hood which recently added USDT support.\r\n\r\nA live demo can be fund on [bitcoind.observer](https://bitcoind.observer). Currently showing [block validation] during IBD and per message type [P2P traffic] stats. I was surprised who well it works. Might be a real alternative to statoshi once we add more tracepoints about e.g. UTXO set, peer dis/connections, and so on.\r\n\r\n[block validation]: https://bitcoind.observer/d/V5pGXBW7k/block-validation-during-idb?orgId=1&from=1627333200000&to=1627390800000\r\n[P2P traffic]: https://bitcoind.observer/d/Z3_pFfZnz/p2p-network-traffic?orgId=1&refresh=30s&from=now-24h&to=now",

This can inform us about performance/memory benefits of epochs and our current ancestor/descendant limits. I'm particularly interested to see information about this for reorgs.\r\n- Records of **prevouts** of transactions added to the mempool. This would let us track things like \"how many times is a tx replaced / how many bytes were relayed before this payment confirmed?\"\r\n- Signature and script cache usage.\r\n- {Resource usage, rate of valid transactions} of our data structures holding invalid/unvalidated transactions: `m_orphanage`, `vExtraTxnForCompact`, `m_recent_rejects` filter\r\n- Query and hit rate for `LockPoints` cached in mempool entries\r\n- The \"shape\" of packages in mempools, e.g. number of direct parents vs total ancestors\r\n\r\n> NYDIG has a $4500 bounty for mempool tracepoints.\r\n\r\nIt's nice that there's a bounty to encourage contributions. I'm glad the bounty stresses the importance of a clearly-defined use case. We already have logs for {added, removed} mempool transactions, but there's definitely room for improvement. Hopefully NYDIG would be okay with different but still useful instrumentation?",

      "body": "@glozow those would be some awesome use cases for ebpf tracepoints. Quite technical in their scope. I would like to take to working on a few of these points if desired. Number 1 has most of my interest.\r\n\r\n### In regards to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24935\r\nIn regards to my existing PR for mempool tracepoints should I remove mempool additions/eviction tracepoints as something to even pursue? Even if the NYDIG bounty no longer qualifies I want to contribute. Learning about the power of ebpf,usdt, and bcc has been a great addition to my skillset and has captured my interest.\r\n\r\n### Existing logging/tracing solutions in the mempool _(adds & evictions)_\r\nThe current in-mempool implementation seems to be using the ZMQ interface but doesn't currently provide a complete solution to trace all adds/removals from the pool.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 functions for broadcasting mempool events referenced in `txmempool.cpp` and one of them is not even used.  These are `CValidationInterface::TransactionAddedToMempool` and `CZMQNotificationInterface::TransactionRemovedFromMempool` \r\n\r\n - Currently `CValidationInterface::TransactionAddedToMempool` is not called anywhere in this repo\r\n - `CZMQNotificationInterface::TransactionRemovedFromMempool` is only called if the tx was not removed for the reason of 'BLOCK'. The current implementation instead leaves a multiline comment stating that to find the evicted txs from a block, look at the latest txs in the mined block. A valid solution but why not leverage a trace to to a sandboxed kernel program with extremely little overhead. Even if the user doesn't need this functionality it can even be compiled out into a nop instruction if built without tracing support. \r\n \r\nOn the topics of block evictions, they seem to be one hardest events to trace/log if the 256 bit txid is included since the volume of data being streamed is quite high with up to thousands of evictions in a very short time. Using a ringbuffer and a bpffs queue in tandem all mempool evictions can be logged in completeness and I am pretty sure they maintain the order eviction was requested in. \r\n \r\n### https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24935 eBPF solution to logging mempool additions/evictions\r\n\r\nFirstly by using eBPF tracepoints the overhead of tracing an event is minimal and isolated. bpftrace, python, and bcc scripts can be written in any manner desired to accommodate the collection of performance stats, testing, and custom user metrics. These custom scripts have no impact on the underlying functionality of the users current bitcoind build as all data is being passed though the kernel sandbox and the bitcoin core traces are a unidirectional event including a trace of all the txs being passed in and out of the mempool. \r\n\r\nThe example .py script implemented to trace mempool events in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24935 logs each request for a tx addition/removal from the mempool and the relevant information to validate/compare the current mempool with it's output. These logs are complete without erroneous data. The whole extended test suite was ran and It is possible to log all 328416 function calls to add or evict txs from the mempool. As a note even if these traces are determined to not be a candidate using some of the methods included in log_mempool_activity.py would be very useful in fixing some of the existing scripts that display incomplete data and/or have dropped events. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n_Edit: a word...phrases_",
