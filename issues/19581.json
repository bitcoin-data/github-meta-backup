    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWith the current block validation rules, Bitcoin will \"die\" on 2106-02-07, when the unsigned 32-bit timestamp rolls over.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCurrently, Bitcoin's timestamp protection rules work as follows:\r\n1. The new block timestamp may not be lower than the median of the last 11 blocks'\r\n2. The new block timestamp may not be greater than the current time plus two hours\r\n\r\nIf they would be changed to the following, the problem would be solved:\r\n1. The new block timestamp plus *k*\\*2^32, where *k* is an integer, may not be lower than the median of the last 11 blocks'\r\n2. The new block timestamp plus *k*\\*2^32, where *k* is an integer, may not be greater than the current time plus two hours\r\n3. The values of *k* in 1 and 2 must be the same\r\n\r\nThis would cause a hardfork in 2106, which is 85.5 years from now, by which time 95% of nodes would hopefully have updated.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n64-bit timestamps have been proposed. They would break compatibility with a lot of other software, and cause a hardfork before the date of timestamp overflow.",
