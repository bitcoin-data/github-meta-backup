With this change, there's _only_ static by default, so default configs continue to only build one set of objects.\r\n> \r\n> With this commit, if you want shared libs/dlls, you'd need to configure with `--enable-shared`, which will _then_ build everything twice. For a project that's mostly about executables, that seems reasonable to me. (Also, amazingly `--enable-shared --disable-static` does the right thing and also builds a single copy of everything for shared libs)\r\n> \r\n> This also means we don't have to special-case the Windows case in this pr. We'll just know that `--enable-shared` is busted on windows (and maybe warn as such for that config?)\r\n> \r\n> The only downside I can think of is that devs aren't going to be linking the lib every day as part of their typical workflows so link problems may show up around release time. IMO that's a reasonable trade-off.",

We shall see.\r\n\r\nI don't see why we should be refactoring our code, that works everywhere else, and adding more libraries, to work around a problem that occurs for a single OS, and in some part, only in certain build configurations. Especially if we know that it's libtool that is \"broken\", it'd seem better for us to just use a single, well documented, scoped to the Windows use of libtool workaround, as opposed to changing our source code to accommodate its quirkiness.\r\n\r\nNote that #24994 alone seemingly doesn't fix all the issues, i.e #24972, so even if we went ahead with either/both changes, we're still going to continue to carry the windows-only libtool workarounds we've already got in our build system, which I'd say is the worst of both worlds (code refactoring + still having windows libtool workarounds). I'd rather add one more (well documented) libtool workaround to the pile, and hope that this may all become a moot point some time into the future (cmake 🦆s).

      "body": "I'm not sure I understand the discussion about nested librarries, or avoiding libtool. This problem has nothing to do with libtool except that libtool is the one guilty of adding the problematic define.\r\n\r\nPlease note also that any library could be causing this problem. It just happens to be libpthread. It could equally be libevent or libzmq.\r\n\r\nAlso please note that `DLL_EXPORT` is not any kind of magic define or token. It's a convention used by libtool, similar to autoconf's `HAVE_CONFIG_H`. In this case though, there's a clash of uses.\r\n\r\nHere's the snippet we're dealing with in pthread.h:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#if defined DLL_EXPORT\r\n#ifdef IN_WINPTHREAD\r\n#define WINPTHREAD_API __declspec(dllexport)\r\n#else\r\n#define WINPTHREAD_API __declspec(dllimport)\r\n#endif\r\n#else\r\n#define WINPTHREAD_API\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's part of the explanation I provided in the patch to upstream:\r\n\r\n> \r\n> When building a libtool lib, libtool automatically defines \"DLL_EXPORT\" for objects intended to be linked into a shared library.\r\n> \r\n> Applications are then intended to also define \"DLL_EXPORT\", which has the effect of importing the functions from the exported dll.\r\n> \r\n> However, this goes bad when a downstream user is itself a libtool lib which is attempting to statically link in libpthread. libtool sets \"DLL_EXPORT\" for itself as expected, so that the downstream lib can export its own symbols. HOWEVER it also has the effect of trying to _import_ the libpthread symbols, which doesn't work because libpthread is being linked statically rather than as a dll.\r\n\r\nSo the problem is that we're trying to import when building a dll. [From the Microsoft docs:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/importing-function-calls-using-declspec-dllimport?view=msvc-170)\r\n\r\n> You only want to use __declspec(dllimport) when calling DLL functions from outside the DLL itself. Don't use __declspec(dllimport) on functions inside a DLL when building that DLL.\r\n\r\nThe fix is thus to avoid doing the dllimport when building our own dll.  The nice way would be to have a define that could be set to avoid it. This is the [fix I've proposed upstream.](https://sourceforge.net/u/theuni2/mingw-w64/ci/cf09b48dae24316b06fee83b23eb0af574bb5f14/)\r\n\r\nBarring that, we just need to avoid having `DLL_EXPORT` defined in any file that ends up including pthread.h. Libtool appends this by default. The configure change I've proposed above prevents libtool from doing that, thereby fixing the problem.\r\n\r\nAnother solution might be to add `-UDLL_EXPORT` to AM_CPPFLAGS, overriding libtool's define.\r\n\r\nEdit: In case it isn't clear/obvious, upstream winpthreads itself is build using libtool, which is why they use that define and why it's colliding with ours.",

Linking dependencies of a dynamic library into it statically can also make sense, but can cause problems because this can leave you with multiple instances of the same static library having to coexist inside the same process, each with their own separate global variables, and possibly inconsistent function definitions. This is ok if libraries are high level, and you aren't trying to share pointers or handles between the different library instances. I don't think we know if this applies to pthreads, but Cory's upstream patch should let us find out.\r\n",

I explored this a little bit today because I agree a single dll may or may not be how we want to ship in the end.\r\n\r\nIn fact, to your point, libstdc++ currently still gets linked dynamically. This can be fixed as usual (I did a quick check) by adding `-static-libstdc++` to the dll link flags, but it definitely begs the question: do we want to ship a few dll's instead?\r\n\r\nI think at least in the beginning we should try to lump everything into a single dll. By controlling our exports (I think) we should be able to avoid leaking out symbols like `pthread_create` which would obviously be problematic.\r\n\r\nBut I agree it's very possible we run into startup problems or handle collisions or something that forces us to switch to multiple dll's. Something like an app  interacting with `thread_local` vars on a thread spawned by the dll... I could see that going sideways.\r\n\r\n",

However, this means we need tight control over our symbol visibility. If you're not familiar, see here for the canonical primer: https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility\r\n\r\ntl;dr: We set everything to \"hidden\", then manually mark the functions that are meant to be visible.\r\n\r\nI've pushed up a branch that defines our _current_ api as used by bitcoin-chainstate here: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commits/fix-dll-exports2 . This includes #27144 as a bugfix if you wouldn't mind reviewing.\r\n\r\nNote that this branch is just a test to see how we're currently looking. At the moment we're exporting random functions and globals all over the place. Obviously that's not ideal, but at least this helps us to see where we are.\r\n\r\nThis can be checked by building a shared bitcoin-chainstate.exe. If any of the `EXPORT_SYMBOL`s are removed, bitcoin-chainstate.exe will fail to link.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo answer your question about secp.. It is not marked as exported by libkernel (we fixed that in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1105). This means that libkernel can use secp _internally_, but any exe that links against it can't see those functions. Just like it can't see pthreads/libstdc++/etc. If exe's saw those functions, they'd collide with their _own_ toolchain functions and things would get weird.\r\n\r\nHowever, this introduces the possibility of having libkernel and bitcoin-chainstate using different secp versions. For this reason, we may decide to ship multiple dll's instead. But either way, we'll want to define our function visibility in order to build the smallest possible binaries.\r\n\r\nHope that thought-dump helps, I'd be happy discuss further in realtime.",
