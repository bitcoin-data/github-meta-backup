    "title": "Why is Bitcoin Core structured as a wallet? I know that it began as a wallet, but is it possible to make it like a GUI block explorer instead?",
    "body": "I'm always frustrated when I open up Bitcoin Core, and then all I get is an empty wallet GUI. I see no information about the block-chain itself. When I want to see on-chain data, I have to go to centralized websites instead.\r\n\r\nI would like to see Bitcoin Core be restructured as a GUI block explorer. Delete all the wallet features. Bitcoin Core is a really, really bad wallet, to be honest. Didn't Core developer Luke Dash Junior just lose his entire stash of 300 coins because he was using a internet-connected Bitcoin core as a hot wallet? \r\n\r\nIt is very bad practice to run a hot wallet, period. Private key information should never ever touch a internet connected computer. I use Electrum on TAILS for signing transactions, and I use Electrum on Windows as a watch only wallet. \r\n\r\nI would like to see Bitcoin Core be a locally run self sovereign version of blockchain.com/explorer or mempool.space. \r\n\r\n",
