    "body": "I noticed recently I couldn't comment on two closed PRs. One is #27103 which was closed without an explanation. I wanted to ask why it was closed and whether #27125 might be a replacement for it. The other was my own PR #18608, which I wanted to reopen, but couldn't (even though the branch commit was unchanged at the time), so I opened another PR #27224, and now I can't comment on #18608 to say that it's been replaced by #27224.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the restrictions on comments are an anti-spam measure, so I wonder if there is a technical fix that would allow ordinary project members to comment on closed PRs like these?\r\n\r\nFWIW the messages I see on these two PRs are \"fanquake locked and limited conversation to collaborators 3 weeks ago\" and \"DrahtBot locked as resolved and limited conversation to collaborators on Aug 16, 2022\"",
